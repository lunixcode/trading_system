        "content": "In this article, we will look at the top 20 US states for AI jobs. We have also discussed the growth of AI in the employment landscape in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 US States for AI Jobs.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed exceptional growth since its inception in 1956, reaching new heights with milestones such as the launch of ChatGPT-3.5 in 2022. This technology offers immense benefits for businesses such as automation, enhanced analytics, and improved decision-making powers. As evidenced by Bloomberg Intelligence's projection of a $1.3 trillion market for generative AI by 2032, it's clear that AI adoption is no longer a choice but a necessity for businesses aiming to stay competitive and maximize outcomes.\n\nThe impact of AI on hiring practices is also profound as recruiters are increasingly seeking AI experts to integrate this transformative technology into their operations. Data from the Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) Research Institute has highlighted a tenfold increase in weekly search queries related to generative AI from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023. Interestingly, contrary to fears of job displacement, AI adoption is driving an increase in demand for both freelancers and full-time employees, as businesses recognize the need for skilled professionals.

McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of current work hours across different sectors could be automated, thanks to AI development. This automation of repetitive tasks allows workers to focus on higher-value activities, driving productivity and promoting innovation across industries. To read more about AI creating jobs, see the Jobs AI Will Create.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile concerns persist regarding the potential threat of AI to certain roles, proactive measures can mitigate such risks. Workers in fields susceptible to automation can embrace AI tools to enhance their skill sets and remain relevant in the evolving job market. By capitalizing on AI-powered analytics and automation, individuals can augment their capabilities, drive efficiencies, and adapt to the changing demands of their professions, ensuring continued career growth and resilience in the face of technological disruption.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the rise of generative AI has spotlighted the dominance of the San Francisco Bay Area in the tech industry. According to a report by the Brookings Institution, of the approximately 2,200 generative AI job postings in the last year across 380 US metro areas, a quarter were in the Bay Area. This concentration of opportunities suggests a \"winner take most\" scenario, further solidifying the region's hold on technology. It is worth highlighting that the US is also known to be the country that has the most jobs for AI.\n\nWhile the prominence of San Francisco and San Jose in the tech industry may not come as a surprise, the Brookings report challenges the idea that smaller tech hubs like Austin or Miami could emerge as contenders. Instead, it suggests that the Bay Area's influence could strengthen. With the majority of investment and top startups in generative AI located in Silicon Valley, the region remains the epicenter of technological innovation. To read more about artificial intelligence, see the list of of 55 Artificial Intelligence Companies in USA.\n\nSpeaking of AI companies, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s commitment to developing AI is evident through its investment in Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup. With an additional $2.75 billion injection, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s total investment in Anthropic now stands at $4 billion.\n\nCollaboration between Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Anthropic extends beyond financial investment to technology development. Anthropic will capitalize on AWS as its primary cloud provider and utilize Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s custom chips to build, train, and deploy AI models. Furthermore, AWS customers, predominantly businesses, will gain access to Anthropic's AI models through Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s service, Bedrock. Interestingly, companies like Delta Air Lines and Siemens are already utilizing Bedrock to access Anthropic's AI capabilities, highlighting the practical applications and demand for AI solutions in various industries.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s investment in Anthropic aligns with the overall tech industry, where major players are actively investing in AI startups. This trend reflects growing public and business interest in AI technologies and their potential to drive innovation across sectors.\n\nOn the other hand, with an aim to address the global AI skills gap, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) has planned on training two million learners in artificial intelligence by the end of 2026, with a specific focus on underrepresented communities. This commitment aligns with a growing recognition of the importance of AI skills in the workforce, as highlighted by a recent study indicating that 40% of executives foresee the need for their workforce to reskill over the next three years due to AI and automation implementations. To achieve this ambitious goal, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is expanding its collaborations with universities globally and partnering with NGOs to deliver AI training to adult learners. Additionally, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) is launching new generative AI coursework through its SkillsBuild platform, offering enhanced access to AI education and technical roles.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) will be providing AI training for university faculty and students, offering free online courses on generative AI and other topics through IBM SkillsBuild, and introducing a roadmap of new course offerings in generative AI.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Insiders Are Selling These 10 Retail Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Insiders Are Selling These 5 Retail Stocks.\n\nThe strength of the US consumer has kept the market surprised and baffled over the past several months, as the Fed continues to battle inflation that remains sticky amid strong consumer spending. The National Retail Federation recently said in a report that it estimates retail sales to increase in the range of 2.5% and 3.5% in 2024, compared to retail sales growth of 3.6% recorded last year.\n\nJack Kleinhenz, the chief economist at the NRF, said that consumers have shown “much great resilience than expected” and “it’s hard” to be bearish on the consumer. Most of this strength comes from household savings accumulated during the pandemic days.\n\nBut Kleinhenz wondered whether this consumer resilience will continue in the future since inflation begins to bite and savings diminish.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, US consumers began spending money on goods instead of experiences and services amid lockdowns. But immediately after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions, Americans began spending a fortune on experiences. However, Bank of America in its “Consumer Checkpoint” report published in January said that its Winter Spending Survey showed that consumers were planning to decrease spending on dining out, takeout, social events and experiences\n\nBank of America said it surveyed about 2,000 consumers in the US and found that a whopping 59% of the consumers were planning to start 2024 with caution, with intentions to save money and cut back on spending.\n\nSo far this year, retail and consumer stocks remain strong. VanEck Retail ETF (NASDAQ:RTH) is up about 12.2% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a 10.2% gain for the S&P 500. Investors would be watching Q1’2024 earnings of retailers closely to see how the US consumer is reacting to the changes in inflation and wage growth. Some analysts are also hopeful that rate cuts would bode well for retail stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack in December, a Wall Street Journal report cited Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, who said at the time that consumer has been “resilient throughout it all.” Woods said that the overall sentiment was that it’s “OK, we aren’t going to be in a recession. Things are getting little bit better.”\n\nCanaccord’s Tony Dwyer recently talked with CNBC and said that the Federal Reserve would need to get “aggressive” when it comes to rate cuts and should not keep interest rates higher for longer to avoid massive layoffs and recession. Dwyer believes consumer discretionary stocks, along with healthcare and financials, are some of the areas to pile into if you want to benefit from the rate cut environment. Insiders Are Selling These Retail Stocks\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some retail stocks which insiders are selling. For that we first used Insider Monkey’s insider trading stock screener and listed down all retail stocks that saw insider selling activity over the past few weeks. From these companies we picked 10 stocks with the highest insider selling in terms of dollar value. Some top names in the list include Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (NYSE:AMZN). But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nSignet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) is one of the biggest retailers of diamond jewelry.

The biggest stake in Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) is owned by Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group which owns a $798 million stake in Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG).\n\n9. Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nCamping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH) sells RVs and related parts. Camping World Holdings Inc's (NYSE:CWH) CEO Marcus Lemonis dumped 100,000 shares of Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH) on March 15 for $25.63 per share. The total dollar value of this insider selling activity was about $2.6 million. Since this transaction the stock has fallen by about 1.54%.\n\nOut of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 23 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH) was David Abrams’ Abrams Capital Management which owns a $134 million stake in Camping World Holdings Inc (NYSE:CWH).\n\nIn addition to CWH, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (NYSE:AMZN) are also seeing insider selling.\n\n8. Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nFloor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND) is a specialty retail company that sells  hard surface flooring and related accessories. David Christopherson, who is the Exec VP/CAO/CLO at Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND), on February 27 sold 6,850 shares of Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND) at $118.70 per share. Since then the stock has increased by 5.66%. Floor & Décor Holdings Inc's (NYSE:FND) CEO Thomas Taylor also dumped 20,000 shares of Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND) on February 28 at $123.11 a piece.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND). The biggest stake in Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND) is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which had a $533 million stake in Floor & Décor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND) heading into 2024.\n\nIn addition to FND, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (NYSE:AMZN) are also seeing insider selling.\n\nSouthernSun SMID Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) late in the third quarter. FND is a specialty retailer of hard surface flooring operating 207 warehouse format stores across the U.S. The stores are large (avg. ~78k sq ft) and offer a variety of in-stock hard-surface flooring, including tile, wood, laminate, vinyl, and natural stone along with decorative accessories and wall tile, installation materials, and adjacent product categories. Customers include professional flooring installers (40% of sales) and homeowners (60%) primarily doing residential repair and remodel projects. FND directly sources its products from over 240 vendors in over 24 countries, enabling it to eliminate middlemen such as agent/ brokers, importers, and distributors. We believe this direct sourcing model gives the company a cost advantage over its competitors and allows it to offer customers the lowest prices in the industry. FND is also able to offer the largest selection of in-stock flooring in the industry because its stores are significantly larger than its competitors. This differentiated value proposition has enabled FND to consistently take market share from both home improvement centers (~30% of the market) and independent specialty retailers (~60% of the market).\n\nThe management team, led by Tom Taylor, CEO, has a strong track record of successfully opening more than 170 new stores over the last decade, with plans to eventually reach 500. Stores typically generate 50% cash on cash returns by year 3, meaning each new store should create significant value for shareholders. The balance sheet is strong with Net Debt/ EBITDA at 0.3x (2.7x including lease liabilities), and management has the flexibility to generate additional free cash flow if needed by slowing the pace of store count growth.\n\nIn summary, we believe FND will execute its new store strategy over the next decade, resulting in ~5x increase in earnings per share, significant free cash flow available to be distributed to shareholders, and a total shareholder return in the teens.”\n\n7. Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 36\n\nDanielle L Kirgan, who is the Chief Transformation Officer at Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M), dumped 15,070 shares of Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) on March 22 at $20.42 per share.\n\nPaul Griscom, Senior VP/Controller at Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M), also sold 2,969 Macy’s shares on March 22 at $20.43 per share.\n\nSince March 22, Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) stock has lost about 3% in value\n\n6. Ross Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nRoss Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST) is one of the retail stocks seeing recent insider selling activity. Michael J. Hartshorn, the Chief Operating Officer of Ross Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST), on March 18 sold 21,056 shares of Ross Stores Inc (NASDAQ:ROST) at $145.14 per share.

        "content": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow Much Debt Does Amazon.com Carry?\n\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Amazon.com had debt of US$73.8b at the end of December 2023, a reduction from US$85.1b over a year. However, it does have US$86.8b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$13.0b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nA Look At Amazon.com's Liabilities\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$164.9b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.1b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$86.8b and US$46.4b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$192.8b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nOf course, Amazon.com has a titanic market capitalization of US$1.87t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Amazon.com boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nEven more impressive was the fact that Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 176% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Amazon.com can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Amazon.com may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. In the last three years, Amazon.com basically broke even on a free cash flow basis. While many companies do operate at break-even, we prefer see substantial free cash flow, especially if a it already has dead.\n\nSumming Up\n\nAlthough Amazon.com's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of US$13.0b. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 176% over the last year. So we are not troubled with Amazon.com's debt use. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Amazon.com, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has $159 Billion Invested in These 8 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett said in an interview with CNBC in April 2023 that artificial intelligence (AI) was \"extraordinary.\" However, Buffett quickly added that he didn't \"know if it's beneficial.\"\n\nWhatever the multibillionaire's opinion of AI is, he has already benefited financially from the technology. Buffett has invested $159 billion in these eight AI stocks -- and most of them have been big winners over the last 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest AI holding for Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's stake in the tech giant is worth roughly $156.9 billion. The stock hasn't performed especially well over the last 12 months, though, due to sluggish sales growth.\n\nThat could change soon. Apple is widely expected to unveil its AI strategy at its developer conference and announce new AI functionality for iPhones in June.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire owns $1.8 billion in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. Although Buffett didn't make the original decision to buy the e-commerce and cloud services leader, he's expressed regret for not buying the stock earlier.\n\nAmazon has long been a pioneer in AI, reaping substantial efficiency gains from the technology. The ongoing surge in the adoption of generative AI should provide a big tailwind for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nIs Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) a Buffett AI stock? Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire's regulatory filings, the answer is a resounding \"yes.\" Berkshire subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) has a stake in Microsoft worth $11.6 million.\n\nMicrosoft has been one of the biggest winners of the AI boom. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its product lineup. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform is also enjoying strong growth as customers scramble to build and deploy AI apps.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBuffett also owns shares of Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) thanks to NEAM. The investment firm's position in Broadcom was valued at over $9.5 million at the end of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom is a leading provider of custom AI accelerators and networking software used to scale AI applications. Its new XPU accelerator could claim the record as the biggest chip ever built for a consumer AI company.\n\n5. NXP Semiconductors\n\nNXP Semiconductors(NASDAQ: NXPI) is another AI chipmaker in NEAM's portfolio (which makes it a Buffett stock, albeit indirectly). NEAM owns a stake of $8.9 million in NXP.\n\nAI is everywhere these days -- and that's good for NXP. The company focuses on chips for the automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and communications infrastructure markets.\n\n6. Qualcomm\n\nThrough NEAM, Buffett has a position worth $8.3 million in Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM). Although Qualcomm hasn't delivered the sizzling gains over the last 12 months that some AI stocks owned by Buffett have, it's still up over 35%.\n\nQualcomm is best known for its technology, which is used in mobile phones. The company is also investing heavily in AI and recently teamed up with several other top tech companies to develop open-source software that allows AI apps to run on any chip.\n\n7. IBM\n\nBerkshire Hathaway once directly owned shares of IBM(NYSE: IBM) but no longer does. However, the tech pioneer remains a Buffett stock due to NEAM's $5 million stake in IBM.\n\nIBM might not be viewed as much of an AI leader now as it once was. The company's Watson platform, though, is used by many companies to harness the power of AI.\n\n8. Alphabet\n\nBuffett admitted publicly a few years ago that he made a mistake by not investing in Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) earlier. While the tech giant still isn't in Berkshire's portfolio, NEAM owns around $2.5 million worth of Alphabet's shares.\n\nAlphabet has had a couple of public relations embarrassments with its AI efforts. But the company remains one of the leaders in AI development. It's also rumored to be in negotiations with Apple about integrating the Google Gemini AI models with iPhones.\n\nAre these Buffett AI stocks good picks to buy now?\n\nI think that all of these Buffett AI stocks could deliver solid long-term returns. Which are the best picks? I like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. In my view, AI will primarily run in the cloud. These three companies operate the largest cloud platforms and should continue to be big winners for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Fresh all-time highs for the S&P 500 index have been a serious high note for investors as 2024 kicks off. Whether you're new to the stock market or have been investing for years, you have discovered (or will soon) that it requires you to deal with regularly seeing highs and lows. How you react to what you see will affect your investing journey. What you always need to keep in mind is that the stock market has a remarkable habit of throwing off bearish periods and rising even higher over time.\n\nNow that a new bull market is in full swing, you might be looking for ways to invest. If you're looking for businesses that you can buy and hold for five years at least, and you have cash on hand not needed for bills or other near-term financial obligations, here are two unstoppable stocks to consider for your portfolio right now.\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) is a well-known name in the pharmaceutical space with a proven ability to turn a profit. J&J's overall net sales of $85 billion in 2023 were up 7% from 2022. This is a fairly normal growth rate for the business year in and year out.\n\nTo help spark further growth in the years ahead, J&J has been making some structural changes in recent years. One notable shift was the spinoff of its consumer health business, which manages its over-the-counter products like Tylenol, Listerine, and Band-Aid, into a separate publicly traded entity called Kenvue. The spinoff accomplished multiple goals for Johnson & Johnson, but the main stated reason for it was to remove a slower-growing business segment. The company also generated $13.2 billion in cash proceeds from Kenvue's public debut and an accompanying debt offering.\n\nJohnson & Johnson will use that cash infusion, in part, to bolster its remaining pharmaceutical and medical device business segments. In 2023, the pharmaceutical business brought in net sales of about $55 billion, a 5% operational increase from the prior year. The medical device business generated net sales of $30 billion, up 12% operationally from 2022, with its Abiomed subsidiary serving as a key driver of this segment's growth. Abiomed is a heart pump specialist acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also boasts an impressive pipeline of potential blockbusters. On March 22, the company garnered regulatory approval for Opsynvi, a once-daily single-combination tablet to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Rival Merck received the regulatory green light for its own PAH drug on March 26. Merck's drug, called Winrevair, is administered as a subcutaneous injection once every three weeks. Johnson & Johnson controls roughly 50% of the $7 billion PAH drug market. Having a daily pill treatment could help it improve that market share.\n\nJohnson & Johnson's growth story revolves around a wide-ranging group of blockbuster medicines and products across specialties including immunology, cardiology, and oncology.\n\nIt also happens to be a faithful dividend payer. With over six decades and counting of consecutive annual dividend increases to its name, this healthcare giant provides a steady source of passive income for long-term investors. The stock's performance has admittedly been less than impressive in the last couple of years over investor concerns regarding some significant liability lawsuits. J&J is working to resolve the disputes and no one doubts its business will continue once settlements are reached. In the meantime, the stock drop has contributed to a higher yield. The yield sits around 3%, roughly twice as much as the average stock trading on the S&P 500.\n\nThis stock looks like a solid choice for investors searching for a reliable healthcare stock and some dividend income to boot.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has proven its resilience through many market environments since its IPO in 1997. The volatile economy of the last few years presented several challenges for companies across industries, and Amazon was no exception. Still, it has demonstrated its ability to adjust and grow despite some tough headwinds. It focused heavily on improving operational efficiency while remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving operating landscape.\n\nWhat has helped it manage during this time is the continued growth of its core businesses like e-commerce and cloud computing, which have benefitted from continuing investments in artificial intelligence. For example, Amazon pumped $2.7 billion into AI start-up Anthropic last year (boosting its total investment to $4 billion) to gain insider access to the advances being made in generative AI. As part of the deal, the AI start-up will be training its models on Amazon's Inferentia and Trainium chips. Amazon's cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), will also become the primary cloud provider for Anthropic's mission-critical workloads.\n\nAmazon is leveraging its cloud division to incorporate AI into a range of products and services. For example, AWS HealthScribe allows medical providers to create notes from appointments with patients using generative AI. Another example is Amazon Bedrock, which enables clients to build generative AI applications using technology from companies like Anthropic and many other AI firms, all through the flagship AWS platform.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon reported profits of $30 billion on net sales of $575 billion. The year prior, Amazon reported a net loss of $2.7 billion. Amazon also reported operating income of $37 billion for 2023, a 200% increase from 2022.\n\nWhile e-commerce is the largest driver of revenue for Amazon, AWS is the leading driver of profitability. Out of Amazon's total operating income, $25 billion -- or about 70% -- was derived from AWS in 2023.\n\nAmazon stock is trading up by about 84% from one year ago on investor enthusiasm for its growth potential. Given the investments the company is making and the expanding markets it serves with its various business segments, it shouldn't have trouble continuing to grow and rewarding investors. This is a business you can buy and hold on to for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "JEPI ETF: Turn Your Tax Return Into Monthly Dividends",
        "content": "It’s tax time again. If you are receiving a tax return, it’s the perfect opportunity to consider buying a monthly dividend ETF to jumpstart your investment portfolio. Rather than splurging on an expensive toy or trinket that you’ll likely forget about in a year, it’s a wise idea to consider putting the money to work for you by buying a dividend ETF like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI).\n\nMaking an investment like this is the gift that keeps on giving. Not only does it feature a significant 7.5% dividend yield, but it pays its holders a dividend on a monthly basis, setting them up for a stream of recurring passive income.\n\nI’m bullish on this 7.5%-yielding ETF from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) based on its above-average yield, monthly payout schedule, solid group of blue-chip holdings, and reasonable expense ratio. Let’s take a closer look at this popular dividend ETF below.\n\nWhat Is the JEPI ETF, Anyway?\n\nJEPI debuted in May 2020, and with its high dividend yield and monthly payout schedule, it has quickly become the largest and most popular actively-managed ETF in the market today. The fund is managed by seasoned portfolio managers Hamilton Reiner and Raffaele Zingone, who have 37 and 33 years of investment industry experience, respectively.\n\nJEPI’s goal is “to deliver consistent monthly income and the potential for capital appreciation, aiming to capture a majority of the returns associated with the S&P 500 (SPX) with less volatility.”\n\nInvestors should be aware that JEPI derives income from both dividend stocks and options premiums to generate this high yield and stream of monthly payments. According to the fund’s prospectus, JEPI seeks to achieve its objective by investing in stocks within the S&P 500 and “through equity-linked notes (ELNs), selling call options with exposure to the S&P 500 Index.”\n\nJEPI can invest up to 20% of its assets in these ELNs. The ELNs that JEPI invests in are “derivative instruments that are specially designed to combine the economic characteristics of the S&P 500 Index and written call options in a single note form and are not traded on an exchange.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEssentially, JEPI uses these ELNs to generate a consistent stream of income, but it’s important to note that the one potential downside is that selling these call options essentially caps the upside of the fund’s holdings.\n\nAs JPMorgan explains in the prospectus, “When the Fund sells call options within an ELN, it receives a premium but limits its opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of either the underlying benchmark or ETF to the exercise price (plus the premium received). The maximum potential gain on an underlying instrument will be equal to the difference between the exercise price and the purchase price of the underlying benchmark or ETF at the time the option is written, plus the premium received.”\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with this strategy, but investors should always be aware of what they are buying, and as long as investors are comfortable with this potential tradeoff, then JEPI is a great way to generate income from dividends, as we’ll discuss further below.\n\nAn Above-Average Monthly Dividend\n\nJEPI’s 7.5% yield is substantial. Not only is it significantly higher than the average yield for the S&P 500 (currently just 1.4%), but it’s also much higher than the risk-free yield offered by investing in 10-year treasuries (currently 4.2%).\n\nThe monthly payout is also an attractive feature. While most dividend stocks and ETFs pay out on a quarterly basis, JEPI pays a dividend each month like clockwork.\n\nThe amount of the dividend isn’t set in stone and can vary slightly, but right now, these payments average out to a 7.5% yield over the past 12 months, meaning that an investor putting $10,000 into the fund would receive about $750 in dividend payments over the course of the year (if the yield were to remain at 7.5%).\n\nThis is a nice way to use your tax return to make your money work for you and generate a stream of passive monthly income. You can also reinvest the dividends directly into JEPI (either by yourself or by using your brokerage’s dividend reinvestment setting, if applicable) so that each month, it buys a bit more JEPI, and you create a snowball effect as this investment compounds over time.\n\nTop Holdings\n\nJEPI gives its investors ample diversification. It owns 118 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for just 27.2% of the fund. Below, you’ll find a table of JEPI’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, JEPI invests in a strong group of well-known blue-chip stocks. Aside from its 12.5% position in the equity-linked notes (ELNs), as discussed above, six of JEPI’s top nine holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nThe Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Top 10 holdings Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Progressive (NYSE:PGR), and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) all feature ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores.\n\nWhat Is JEPI’s Expense Ratio?\n\nJEPI is reasonably priced with an expense ratio of 0.35%. This means that for every $10,000 an investor puts into the ETF, they will pay $35 in fees each year. If the fund maintains this current expense ratio and gains 5% per year going forward, an investor allocating $10,000 into JEPI will pay $443 in fees over the course of a decade.\n\nIs JEPI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, JEPI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 104 Buys, 16 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average JEPI stock price target of $61.40 implies 6.1% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nBefore you spend your tax return, think about putting it into a dividend ETF like JEPI, which will pay you a dividend each month for the foreseeable future, setting you up on your journey to becoming a dividend investor. You can also reinvest these dividends to accumulate JEPI and buy more shares periodically when you have excess cash, creating a snowball effect as your position compounds and pays even more as it grows.\n\nTo be clear, no investment is without risk, and investors are typically best served by creating a balanced, well-rounded portfolio, but JEPI can certainly be an important piece of one. I’m bullish on this popular ETF based on its attractive 7.5% dividend yield, monthly payout structure, diversified mix of blue-chip U.S. holdings, and reasonable expense ratio.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Exit Now Ahead of Any Chinese App Bans",
        "content": "Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to ban TikTok. Should this ban be ratified by the U.S. Senate, several U.S. companies and the stock market could react negatively. With the measure passing in a 352 to 65 vote, it’s clear the US government sees a threat in TikTok. Though the bill needs to pass in the Senate, it could in theory result in ByteDance selling its TikTok division. Investors should watch out for stocks to exit ahead of Chinese app bans such as the proposed one.\n\nSuch a monumental shift in U.S. policy towards foreign companies could have widespread ramifications for future Chinese listings on U.S. exchanges. This ban could also directly impact the marketing campaigns of several companies that rely on TikTok for exposure. Thus, it is imperative to prepare for the possibility that Chinese companies could become pawns in a new economic Cold War.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nWith the recent success of its subsidiary, Temu, PDD Holdings, (NASDAQ:PDD) might actually benefit in the short term from the TikTok ban. The company has positioned itself as a low-cost competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the e-commerce space. Yet it also competes with TikTok Shop in offering cheap Chinese goods directly from manufacturers. However, Temu relies on expensive social media advertising to reach consumers as it grows its current position.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, general sentiment towards Chinese companies among U.S. retail investors may worsen. Should the U.S. government signal a willingness to ban companies based on national security, investors may choose to divest rapidly. Thus, PDD’s price stability could suffer in the wake of a TikTok ban.\n\nMoreover, Temu is a relatively new venture in the U.S. and is still working on building its business reputation. This has proven difficult for PDD, as many American consumers are put off by the low-quality offerings on Temu.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Why Alibaba Stock Makes Even More Sense to Buy Today. BABA\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nEssentially Amazon’s direct counterpart in China, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) faces similar downsides should TikTok be banned in the U.S.. Much like the aforementioned Temu, Alibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market by offering inexpensive goods purchased directly from Chinese manufacturers. The company’s international reach is mostly limited to Aliexpress and its few cloud computing services. Thus, it could significantly be weakened by a shift in U.S. government policy.\n\nThat’s because AliExpress relies on capturing international markets, such as Europe and South America. Some countries in these regions are hardline opposers of the Chinese Communist Party and may follow suit by banning TikTok. Much like the challenges facing PDD Holdings, Alibaba could struggle to maintain its reputation in Western markets. This could ultimately result in retail investors deciding that Chinese stocks are no longer worth the risk.\n\nEven more concerning is the fact that Alibaba’s CEO, Jack Ma, faced direct punishment from the Chinese government in 2020. Today, Alibaba’s new CEO has been strictly in line with the Communist Party, unlike his astute predecessor.\n\nHelloFresh (HELFY) shutterstock_745923697-min\n\nSource: ThomasDeco / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the companies with the highest spending on TikTok advertising, HelloFresh (OTCMKTS:HELFY) stands to lose exposure as a result of a TikTok ban. Known for its social media marketing, HelloFresh relies on short-form advertisements to spread awareness about its meal kit delivery services. Without TikTok, which reaches 170 million Americans a year, HelloFresh will have to advertise on more expensive apps.\n\nThis could significantly impact the company’s advertisement spending and overall revenues from newly acquired customers. Moreover, HelloFresh’s advertisements tend to perform well on TiTok due to the significant food culture present on the app. With so many viewers turning to TikTok for cooking and recipe videos, it is one of the most natural advertising outlets for HelloFresh.\n\nThis makes HelloFresh one of the stocks that will exit ahead of Chinese app bans, and it could see its stock price take a hit. However, should its share price drop, HelloFresh will recover because its business model does not need TikTok in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now With $1,000 and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The S&P 500 index is up 31% over the past year, but there are several top companies with bright prospects that are poised to deliver more gains. If you have an extra $1,000 to invest, putting that money to work in a well-selected group of growth stocks could work wonders for your savings goals down the road.\n\nTo get you started, read why three Motley Fool contributors believe Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), RH(NYSE: RH), and Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) could grow your money for years to come.\n\nThis winning stock's story is far from over\n\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon has already created wild shareholder wealth for those who invested early enough. It's been one of the best stocks to ever own on the stock market, and it's up 82% over the past year alone.\n\nBut there's so much more to come. Amazon is a forever stock, and it has many opportunities coming at it from its different businesses.\n\nIt's still the king of e-commerce that started the whole story, and e-commerce continues to increase as a percentage of total retail sales. Amazon is better positioned than any other company to benefit from this organic growth driver. It already accounts for more than a third of all U.S. e-commerce, and no other company comes anywhere close to its market share. It keeps upgrading its systems to improve and keep a wide distance from competitors. It's getting more deliveries to more customers overnight, and it's adding millions of products so shoppers don't have to go anywhere to get what they need.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) similarly has a leading position in cloud computing, and it's launching powerful generative AI tools that keep it competitive. It's the preferred solution for high-profile companies like Walt Disney and Verizon Communications, and it has a strong pipeline of new customers and expanded deals. AWS is a high-margin business that accounted for 54% of total operating income in the 2023 fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's working on developing other new businesses, such as advertising, its fastest-growing segment. Total revenue increased 14% year over year, while advertising was up 27%. It's also a high-margin business that helps pad profits, and CEO Andy Jassy said it's \"still early days.\"\n\nEven if you've missed Amazon's gains until now, you can still buy in today and enjoy years of growth.\n\nA proven winner turning the corner\n\nJeremy Bowman (RH): It's been a rough couple of years for RH, the high-end home furnishings company formerly known as Restoration Hardware, but there are signs that it is finally turning the corner on what CEO Gary Friedman called \"the most challenging housing market in three decades.\"\n\nRecent results have also suffered with net income down sharply over the last year, but that sets the company up for a recovery, and Friedman predicted that RH would gain significant market share this year.\n\n2024 is set to be a transformative year for the company as it is launching its \"most compelling product transformation and platform expansion in history.\"\n\nRH has also been aggressively repurchasing its stock to take advantage of the recent sell-off, which also prepares it well for a recovery. In 2023, it reduced its shares outstanding by 20%, and over the last two years, shares outstanding have fallen by 35%.\n\nThe company continues to expand its physical retail footprint, unlike most of its peers, with plans to add five new design galleries in North America, and two more internationally. The company is also doubling down on marketing in anticipation of a recovery, doubling its sourcebook circulation and increasing advertising in design publications.\n\nRH has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over its history, and it seems to be entering another growth cycle as it steps up its marketing efforts and benefits from an expected decline in interest rates and a recovery in the housing market.\n\nWith a return to growth expected and a substantial decline in shares outstanding, RH's profits are likely to soar over the next few years.\n\nShopify's growth story keeps getting better\n\nJohn Ballard (Shopify): The leading online shopping and payments platform has strung together several strong earnings reports. The stock is up 73% over the last 12 months, but with the company starting to widen its offering, it could enter a lucrative stretch of growth to reward shareholders.\n\nShopify is not just a platform helping businesses set up an online storefront. It also continues to introduce new features to the Shop App, which serves as a mobile storefront for small businesses and a powerful shopping assistant for consumers. The app reached $100 million in gross merchandise volume in a single month during the fourth quarter.\n\nShopify's point-of-sale solutions for physical retail locations is another emerging growth catalyst. The company's offline gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 28% year over year in Q4 2023 -- faster than Shopify's total GMV, which grew 23%.\n\nAnother opportunity is business-to-business (B2B) solutions. Shopify Collective is a new service that allows merchants to source products from other brands and ship them directly to customers. B2B is a $450 billion opportunity and management expects it to be a key driver of growth in 2024.\n\nWith these services, Shopify is casting a wider net to win not only more share of e-commerce spending, but increasingly, the entire commerce market, too. The stock offers lots of upside over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks That I'm \"Never\" Selling",
        "content": "When I buy a stock, I try to remind myself that I am buying a small part of a business and that I intend to hold my stocks for the long term. Warren Buffett famously said that his favorite holding period is forever. While that's aspirational more than anything, it's an important reminder that success in investing comes from identifying great businesses and then letting them compound over decades.\n\nWhile some stocks in my portfolio have a lot more to prove to stay there forever, there are some that I can't imagine myself selling. These businesses have long track records and competitive advantages that should pave the way for bright futures. As the saying goes, \"Never say never.\" Yet with these stocks, I'm as close to never selling as one can be.\n\nCostco\n\nEvery time I am struggling to find parking or waiting in the long (but efficient) line to check out, I ask myself why I don't own more Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) stock. While most of my fellow shoppers are likely not having the same thought, we're all there to take advantage of the bulk quantities and low prices. History tells us that this business model has been wildly successful with Costco shares gaining more than 81,000% since its IPO.\n\nCostco ended its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended February 2024) as the third-largest global retailer and the 12th-largest company in the Fortune 500, with 874 locations worldwide. Its membership model works well. More than 92% of Costco members renew their membership and the company brought in nearly $5 billion in membership fees in the past 12 months.\n\nThe low prices keep customers coming in the door, and because Costco sells fewer items than its competitors and turns its inventory over very quickly, it can sometimes even sell items before they need to be paid for. This helps cash flows and reduces expenses.\n\nAmazon\n\nIf there's a retailer that comes first to mind for me other than Costco, it has to be Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). I don't think I am alone in finding myself shopping there before almost anywhere else. Over the trailing 12 months, Amazon stock is up 82%. However, during the market slump of 2022, the company fell nearly 50% as it struggled to get its finances back in order following the massive distribution build-out necessitated by the pandemic surge in orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is certainly back on track and ready to reaccelerate its growth. In 2023, Amazon grew revenue by 12% but the more impressive results were further down the income statement. Operating income increased by 202% and net income grew by 1,226%. These results were driven by a recovery in the e-commerce business, which finally turned the corner after its 2022 struggles. It's also worth remembering that Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader in cloud infrastructure and it grew its revenue by 13% in 2023.\n\nApple\n\nConsumer electronics giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Finding itself increasingly under the microscope of federal antitrust investigations, the stock has fallen 12% over the past three months. This news is certainly worth watching, but it will take years to play out and the rather modest decline in Apple's share price suggests the market's level of concern is less severe than some of the headlines indicate.\n\nTaking a step back, it's important to remember that Apple is still a ubiquitous brand around the world, and especially within the United States. Known for its iPhone and other consumer electronic devices, Apple is slowly becoming a software company. Apple now has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices.\n\nThis creates an ecosystem of apps and subscription services that provide a high-margin income stream for the company. In the most recently reported quarter, services revenue (which is where all the subscription products are reported) grew by 11% to $23 billion. This represents 19% of total revenue, up from 18% in the year prior.\n\nWhy I'm \"never\" selling\n\nAre there scenarios in which I might sell these companies? Sure, anything is possible. However, these three businesses are so competitively advantaged and are still growing so impressively at their large scale, that it's difficult to envision a scenario where they wouldn't warrant a spot in my portfolio. Investing can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be. In my mind, buying and owning these three stocks is about as simple as investing can be.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Offers You Access to Another High-Growth Business Too",
        "content": "Investors who want to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom often turn to Nvidia, and for good reason. The company is the global leader in AI chips, and that's translated into a surge in earnings in recent times. Investors in this tech giant have been winning too, as the stock has soared more than 200% over the past year.\n\nNvidia is one of the stocks referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of technology players that are leaders in their industries -- and each one also happens to be investing in AI. So Nvidia isn't the only company set to score an AI victory and share that victory with investors.\n\nIn fact, another member of the Magnificent Seven is particularly interesting because it offers you exposure to AI as well as access to another high-growth business. So, forget Nvidia, and let's check out this top stock to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA trillion-dollar market\n\nYou probably know this company well, as it may deliver groceries, essentials, and general merchandise to your door -- or offer you access to entertainment like movies and books. I'm talking about Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The company is an e-commerce giant, which is important considering the growth forecast for this market. Global retail e-commerce sales may surpass $8 trillion by 2027, representing a 38% increase from today's level, according to Statista.\n\nAmazon is well positioned to benefit thanks to its dominance, but the company also has made moves in recent times that should ensure this leadership. After struggling with higher inflation back in 2022, Amazon improved its cost structure, cutting jobs, favoring efficiency, and making key changes across its fulfillment network. All of these efforts helped it recover from a difficult time, but they also should help Amazon thrive during better times, too.\n\nFor example, the company shifted its U.S. fulfillment model from a national one to a regional one -- meaning inventory of popular products is kept in areas throughout the country. This has shortened delivery times, helping Amazon lower its cost to serve. And this move also means Amazon is able to be more competitive -- offering a broader selection of items at lower average selling prices while still maintaining its profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Amazon's cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- drives profit at Amazon, the North American business, which includes e-commerce operations, still represented about 40% of total operating income last year. So, Amazon's ability to grow and stay ahead in e-commerce is a crucial element for long-term success, and it looks like Amazon is on the right path.\n\nAmazon and AI\n\nNow, let's consider the company's AI story, which intersects with both its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. Amazon has been using AI to improve its own operations, so this technology could play a role in lifting profitability this way over time.\n\nFor example, through AI, Amazon determines the best delivery routes, another element that's helped it save money and time on deliveries. Another example: Amazon uses AI to help customers rapidly find just the right products -- this, along with low prices and fast delivery speeds, could keep them coming back.\n\nAs for AWS, this business is going all-in on AI, offering everything from a wide selection of chips to a fully managed AI service that lets customers tailor top large language models for their own use. Here, Amazon is set to benefit from AI as it helps its customers deploy AI projects -- and since AWS is the world's biggest cloud company, it has direct access to an enormous number of potential customers.\n\nAll of this means Amazon is set to benefit from AI in two ways. The technology should help it save time and money in its own business operations, therefore boosting profitability over time. And Amazon's position as a provider of AI products and services through AWS also should add to profit.\n\nValuation: Amazon vs. Nvidia\n\nSo investors buying Amazon shares today gain access to all of this AI growth -- and the icing on the cake is the growth potential of the company's e-commerce business. It's not surprising that Amazon, valued at 42x forward earnings estimates, trades at a slight premium to Nvidia (Nvidia trades at 36x forward earnings).\n\nAmazon's strength across e-commerce and cloud computing as well as its investment in AI makes it a business that's well diversified -- meaning it's high growth, yet doesn't come with as much risk as a company that's more dependent on selling AI products or services.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- Nvidia still is an attractive stock for many reasons. But Amazon offers investors a very complete package, including AI and more, and that makes it a top Magnificent Seven buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?",
        "content": "When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.\n\nInstitutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the \"big money\" because of the massive size of their investments.\n\nAs you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?\n\nThe biggest winners\n\nRoughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nNasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.\n\nLarge investors have also flocked to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.\n\nWhy is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.\n\nMiddle of the pack\n\nTwo other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nNasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.\n\nTesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.\n\nThe bottom two\n\nThis leaves Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.\n\nHowever, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.\n\nShould you follow the big money?\n\nInvesting in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.\n\nHowever, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 countries with most billionaires in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries With Most Billionaires in 2024.\n\nChina Loses 155 Billionaires\n\nThe three largest economies in the world including China, India, and the United States lead with the highest number of billionaires in 2024. China and the US have no competition when it comes to paving the way for millionaires to become billionaires due to large markets and growth potential. India is not behind too and is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. China, India, and the US will be the top three largest economies in the world by 2100. China will be the leading economy followed by India and the US. According to the Hurun report for the Global Rich List 2024, the United States added the most billionaires, introducing 109 new billionaires to the list. India was the second best country, adding 84 new people to the list of billionaires. Though foreseeable, China caught most off guard and lost 155 billionaires due to the economic distress and property market crisis.\n\nChina’s economy is going through a systemic slowdown. As we mentioned in our article about 36 countries with deflation or dangerously low inflation, China is suffering from low inflation and it could lead to deflation. China had a successive series of declines in its consumer price index (CPI) during 2023, which started falling in January 2023 and continued till July 2023. The CPI plunged from 104 points in January 2023 to 102.7 points in July 2023. China’s bigger issue is its property market crisis. China's real estate development dropped by 9.6% and home sales fell by 6.5% in 2023. More than 50 real estate companies have defaulted on debt due to the property market crash in China. Real estate giant, The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) is one of the many companies facing default. On March 22, Reuters reported that Chinese authorities are looking into PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for its potential role in The China Evergrande Group’s (OTC:EGRNQ) $78 billion fraud. In addition, the Chinese authorities have fined The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) and Chairman Hui Ka Yan 4.2 billion yuan and 47 million yuan, respectively. The company and chairman have been fined for accounting and bond issuance fraud.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaires Benefiting from AI\n\nGlobally, billionaires increased by 167 to a total of 3,279 in 2024, as per the Hurun report. New York claimed the first spot for the first time in seven years with 119 billionaires choosing to live there followed by London with 97 billionaires. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a main cause for the rise of billionaires as half of new billionaires were driven by AI. Around 10% of the billionaires were from financial services, followed by 8% in consumer goods and 7% in food and beverages. Here is what Hurun’s chief researcher, Rupert Hoogewerf, said:\n\n“AI has been the major driver for wealth growth, generating over half of all the new wealth this year. Whilst Jensen Huang has grabbed many of the headlines as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) broke through the $2 trillion mark and catapulting into the Hurun Top 30 as a result, the billionaires behind Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have seen significant surges in their wealth as investors bet on the value of generated AI.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the real deal with a massive success in AI. In the last six months, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has soared over 100% due to its success in AI, as of March 29. On March 18, the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, during the NVIDIA GTC 2024 Keynote announced the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. This platform is built on purpose to power the new era of AI computing. The NVIDIA Blackwell GPU will be used in the automotive industry and will be integrated into the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor centralized car computer to support generative AI applications and immersive in-vehicle experiences.\n\nMark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has jumped 12 places to fourth spot among the world’s richest people. Zuckerberg has a net worth of around $170 billion, as of March 29, 2024. A year ago in 2023, Zuckerberg’s net worth was around $90 billion. In the last six months, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares have soared over 185%, as of March 29, driven by the AI hype. On February 1, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $5.33, beating consensus estimates by $0.39. The revenue came in at around $40.11 billion, surpassing estimates by $940.64 million. Here are some of the comments from the company’s Q4 2023 earning call:\n\n“This was a good quarter, and it wrapped up an important year for our community and our company. We estimate that there are more than 3.1 billion people who use at least one of our apps each day. 2023 was our year of efficiency, which focused on making Meta a stronger technology company and improving our business to give us the stability to deliver our ambitious long-term vision for AI and the metaverse. And last year, not only did we achieve our efficiency goals, but we returned to strong revenue growth, saw strong engagement across our apps; shipped a number of exciting new products like Threads, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and mixed reality in Quest 3; and of course, established a world-class AI effort that's going to be the foundation for many of our future products.\n\nNow moving forward, a major goal, we'll be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services. And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with.”\n\nWith this context, let’s take a look at the countries with most billionaires in 2024. 25 Countries With Most Billionaires in 2024\n\nA crowded Wall Street plaza, bustling with people carrying briefcases.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 25 countries with most billionaires in 2024, we took the data from the Hurun Global Rich List 2024. The countries with most billionaires are ranked in ascending order of the total number of billionaires in 2024. In countries with similar numbers of billionaires, we have used the year-over-year change in total billionaires as a tie-breaker.

        "title": "15 States with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 15 States with the Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the top 6 States with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, there have been more males than females in the world. If we look at more recent years, in 202 the UN World Population Prospects 2022 Revision reported, there were around 44 million more males than females in the global population. In the same report, the UN also predicted that the worldwide sex ratio will even out by the year 2050, and in the years that follow, females will start outnumbering men.\n\nGender ratios are not even anywhere in the world. In fact, throughout global history, they have been skewed in different regions, and across the globe, for several reasons. For example, in the past, sex-selective abortions and female infanticide were common practices almost everywhere.  Resultantly, there were more young boys than girls. The practice is still common in some countries and regions, which serves as a contributing factor to the gender ratio being skewed in those places. Another example of gender skewing came from the pandemic. The Brookings Institution reported that during COVID-19, more men died than women did. Gender inequality, pregnancies, mortality rates, and sex ratios at birth are other factors that contribute to this globally.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, the countries with the best male-to-female ratio include Qatar, UAE, and Bahrain. The male-to-female ratio in these countries stands at 266, 228, and 164 males per 100 females respectively. The Pew Research Center, in its analysis of the UN’s World Population Prospects 2022 Revision, suggests that the ratio is imbalanced due to the high rates of job-motivated migration to all three of these countries. For example, Qatar’s population comprised 79% foreign people in 2019, and 83% of these were males, which is why,  the country ended up having more males than females.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf we look at the United States, according to the Census data, the country has had more females than males since 1946. The UN predicts that by 2050, the population sex ratio is expected to stand at 99 males per 100 females. Today, females make up 50.4% of the country’s overall population of 334,914,895. According to the Census 2021 (most recent) data, there were about 168 million women in the United States and 164 million males. Note that this does not mean that the gender ratio is equal between all states and cities in America. Like with every other country, the gender ratio is skewed in this one as well, with Alaska having the lowest female-to-male ratio (88.57 females per 100 males).\n\nGender discrimination is still a major obstacle that women have to tackle every day in the States, and in the world at large. Recently, the conversation about the topic was sparked – and the gender bias in today's world was well-demonstrated – through Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT)’s first live-action film, Barbie. America Ferrera’s monologue within the movie especially gained popularity and helped shed light on the issue in a direct manner; speaking of how every woman is expected to live up to society’s unfair and unjust expectations in all aspects of life, including corporate.\n\nFollowing the release of the movie, Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT)’s Q3 sales jumped up to 16%. As these results were announced, Mattel’s CEO and Chairman, CEO Ynon Kreiz said that these results had benefited from the success of the movie, which became a global cultural phenomenon. He further expanded that the movie, a powerful marketing tool, and social commentary, marked a “key milestone” for Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT). In Q4, however, Mattel did not perform well – if interested, you can also read: Here’s Why Mattel (MAT) Fell in Q4.\n\nData from UN Women shows that when women work, economies receive a significant boost in terms of economic diversification, increased workforce, and shared success. Their data also suggests that if the gender gap is closed, the global economy could receive a boost of a whopping 7 trillion USD.  Fortunately, the world is progressing in this regard, too. Today, apart from Mattel, several other companies take the importance of women in society, and the economy, into consideration. For example,  Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B) are among the most prominent Fortune 500 companies with a high female-to-male ratio in their workforces.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), is one of the leading tech companies that have employed the highest percentage of women in their workforces. In order to report accurate data, the company tracks data on the representation of not just women, but also people from underrepresented communities employed in the company. According to its 2022 report, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)’s workforce in the US comprised 49.7% of women. Globally, this percentage was slightly less — but still more, standing at 46.9%. In the company’s 2023 review of compensation, which included base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) found that women in the US employed by Amazon earned “99.9 cents for every dollar men earned performing the same jobs.”\n\nSimilarly, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B) also tracks and reports its overall representation data. According to its most recent report, which was published in 2021, Berkshire Hathaway, and all its subsidiaries, had a total of 14,260 females meaning, women made up 32% of the company’s entire workforce. Note that the other half is not entirely made of men, but also underrepresented folks. Besides its inclusion of women in the workforce, Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B) has also advocated for women to be included increasingly in economic activities, on various occasions. In a 2018 interview with Yahoo Finance, Warren especially praised the female managers at Berkshire Hathaway. 15 States with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US\n\n15 States with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of 15 States with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the US, we have ranked the states in ascending order of females to males ratios.

Its unincorporated city Lima has the 11th highest female-to-male ratio among the cities in the world (See: 25 Cities with Highest Female to Male Ratio in the World). Pennsylvania also has an unemployment rate of 39.9%, which means that it is not one of the most prosperous states in the employment domain. Perhaps, one of the many reasons behind this could be its low percentage of education. According to Census data, only 35.1% of the population in Pennsylvania has a bachelor's degree or higher.\n\n14.

In 1908, 15,000 women organized another protest in the city, demanding shorter working hours, fair wages, voting rights for women, and child labor to be put to an end.

        "title": "30 of the Largest Cities in the World by Population",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss 30 of the Largest Cities in the World by Population.If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go to 10 of the Largest Cities in the World by Population instead.\n\nAs of 2024, there are over 8 billion people in the world. According to the United Nations, this number will see an increase of almost 2 billion by 2050, and by the mid-2080s, it can go as high as 10.4 billion people. In the mid-twentieth century, the total world population was nearly three times less than the number at which it stands today. In other words, Earth was home to 2.5 billion people in 1950, and nearly 70 years later, it grew to 8 billion.\n\nBut what do these numbers really mean? The global population can sound like an abstract concept to many. So, to wrap your mind around the concept, think of a football stadium, like the Michigan Stadium. Officially, the stadium has the capacity to host a crowd of 107,601 people. Now, if you are one of the spectators at this stadium, and if all 107,601 people showed up, the seats would still be full. If there were a few thousand more spectators, it would be only slightly more congested. However, if you added another 100,000 more people, there would neither be any seats left nor any room for anyone to move, given that the ground is a no-go zone.\n\nThis addition of people beyond the capacity of the land is exactly what’s happening to the world right now, and why overpopulation is such an incredibly important issue. While the Earth is huge, its resources are slowly but surely running out. World Resources Institute estimates that food production will have to grow by 50% to sustain the global population by 2050. It might look easy on the surface -- that is until you realize that 40% of the land has become too degraded for agricultural production, and as the UN shows, 90% of the world's topsoil faces risk by 2050 due to unsustainable agricultural practices. You can read more on this in our piece on the 12 most advanced countries in agricultural technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile population growth is a global issue that needs to be carefully navigated, it is also an opportunity for some business owners. According to Michigan State University’s report on the subject, population growth is economic growth. So, whether it is a country or a city, a large population generally equates to an economically prosperous region. For example, in India — the world’s most populous country in 2024 — various multinational corporations have realized the potential of competing in the markets in India. These MNCs realize that the country has a high demand for goods and services, and they have a great opportunity to make profits out of it. Note that a country or a city with a large population not only provides a large consumer base but can also provide for an equally large workforce.\n\nSome of the top leading multinational corporations, like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), have made huge investments in India for these very reasons.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), an American multinational technology company, debuted in India in June 2013. Now, with over 100,000 employees across the country, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s operations are not only limited to e-commerce but also span across Amazon Web Services, Amazon Payments, Amazon Music, and more. In June 2023, the company announced to take its investment to $26 billion by 2030 across verticals.\n\nSimilarly, in 2020, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also committed to invest around $10 billion through equity investments and tie-ups in India over the next five to seven years. Last year, in June, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced plans to open a global fintech operation center in GIFT City in India's western state of Gujarat, which is a substantial investment for the country’s fintech market.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) came to India in 1990 and expanded its operations across 10 cities in India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, and New Delhi, employing over 20,000 workers. Recently, the CEO of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Satya Nadella, announced plans to invest in training 2 million people with artificial intelligence (AI) skills in the country by 2025. While the country offers a large consumer base, it has also become a leading hub for technology, attracting significant investments by these technology companies. 30 of the largest cities in the world by population\n\n30 of the largest cities in the world by population\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 30 largest cities in the world by population, we have considered the cities with a population of 500,000 or above. For that, we consulted the 19th Annual Demographia World Urban Areas, which was released in August 2023, for the latest population data for each country. We then arranged the most populated cities in the world in order of their population, ranking the top 30 in ascending order of their population count. Note that the report measured the populations in urban areas of the largest cities instead of measuring by the official city limits or metropolitan statistical areas.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nWhen interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n“I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’”\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n11.

We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue.

(NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company’s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.\n\nSince we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.\n\nThe company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro.

During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nTop 20 Tobacco Growing Countries in the World 20 Countries with Highest GDP per Capita by 2024 11 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about CNBC's Alpha Stock Survey according to which a “majority” of investors believe the market is headed for a pullback. Cramer is not at all worried about a possible decline in the market.\n\n\"Hallelujah about that survey,\" Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said that the S&P 500 is up 10% in the first three months of 2024, registering the best quarter since 2019. This makes Cramer believe that the market is indeed heading for a pullback. But he said we should “welcome it, not fear it.”\n\nJim Cramer \"Welcomes\" Market Sell-Offs\n\nJim Cramer said that sell-offs are “inevitable.” He said even though we don’t know when they will hit, they are always expected and we should take them as buying opportunities. Cramer said he learned the concept of welcoming sell-offs from the legendary investor Peter Lynch, who famously said that you should expect a 10% pullback on average after every two years and a 25% “beatdown” every six years. Peter Lynch, Cramer reminded, said about 30 years ago that despite pullbacks and sell-offs the market tends to do well in the long term since according to his estimates corporate profits grow 8% per year. Lynch said the stock market follows corporate earnings and as a result made almost accurate predictions about the Dow Jones growing at about 8% per year.\n\nCramer Thinks Market's \"Breadth Problem\" is Solved\n\nJim Cramer also said that anyone who still “insists” that this market is just about major tech names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other Mag. 7 stocks, they should rethink since he believes there are “so many winners” in the market that “it’s insane.” Cramer believes the market no longer has the “breadth” problem because returns are expanding across the board, sometimes at the “expense” of mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer thinks that it’s of no use to stay fixated on the Federal Reserve for now, with all indications saying the central bank is in no hurry to cut interest rates. Cramer wants investors to instead focus on earnings and the performance of individual companies. Cramer said we haven’t seen mass rounds of layoffs that many in the “hard landing” camp were expecting. He said we are prepared to see another hot jobs report, but if it comes softer-than-expected, we will go into the next earnings season with a “pleasant backdrop.” Jim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few days and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nJim Cramer hit the ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ button on LNG company New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE) during one of his recent programs on CNBC. Cramer said Wes Edens (New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE) CEO) is “absolutely terrific at what he does.” Cramer said he likes the stock at the current levels.\n\n10. Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT). Here’s what he said about the sock.\n\n“Oh my god, this is the hottest stock, it’s gonna make money too.”\n\nCramer said that Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT) is a “DevOps shop.” Cramer said that it’s a “hardware-software platform” and people “love these kinds of stocks” and they cannot “live without them.”\n\nEarlier this month, Samsara Inc (NYSE:IOT) posted Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.04, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 48.1% year over year to $276.27 million, beating estimates by $17.96 million.\n\n9. Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 34\n\nJim Cramer thinks Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) is a “great company to buy here.” Cramer said that this mineral company is a “terrific\" and \"really good\" idea.\n\nOver the past one year Rio Tinto Plc ADR Common Stock (NYSE:RIO) shares have gained about 4% over the past one year.\n\nEarlier this month, the stock was downgraded by Liberum to Hold from Buy amid softening demand and China-related concerns.\n\n8. Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nPennsylvania-based  optical materials and semiconductors company Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to buy. Cramer said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) has “a lot of lasers, a lot of optics, a lot of good stuff.” Cramer said Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) is “gonna make money this year.” He said investors should buy some of Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR) stock now and then wait for the stock to come down to buy some more.\n\nIn addition to COHR, Cramer also likes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds had stakes in Coherent Corp (NYSE:COHR).\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In addition to Diamondback Energy, we also initiated positions in Coherent Corp. (NYSE:COHR) and HCA Healthcare in Q4. Coherent supplies engineered materials and devices to semiconductor equipment companies, data center and telecom companies, and it also produces lasers for industrial applications. The company has a long history of successfully innovating in these areas and is well-positioned to benefit from demand for advanced transceivers as artificial intelligence (AI) investments increase. As near-term cyclical headwinds have weighed on the share price, we capitalized on what we view as an attractive price relative to our estimate of intrinsic value to initiate a position.”\n\n7. Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nWhen asked about Pure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG), Cramer said that it’s making money and since the stock has run a lot, investors should buy some of it now and then wait for a pullback before buying more.\n\nPure Storage Inc (NYSE:PSTG) shares have gained 50% year to date through March 29.\n\nDuring its earnings call last month, the company talked about shareholder returns and guidance:\n\n\"We have approximately $145 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization, and we are announcing today a new share repurchase authorization of $250 million. Now turning to our guidance for FY ’25. We expect to return to double-digit revenue growth in FY ’25, growing 10.5% to $3.1 billion. We expect demand across our entire data storage platform will strengthen while also remaining cautious of the macro spending environment. Our annual revenue guide of 10.5% growth also contemplates approximately 50% growth in TCV sales for our collective Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings, which are expected to be $600 million.\n\nTo help better understand the short-term impact that growth of our consumption and subscription offerings have on our annual revenue growth rate we estimate that our forecasted FY ’25 revenue growth would be in the mid-teens when adjusting for the expected growth of both our Evergreen/One and Evergreen/Flex service offerings. Slightly offset by expected additional revenue arising from past TCV sales in FY ’24. Consistent with our philosophy in driving profitable growth, we expect FY ’25 operating profit to be $532 million, and operating margin to be 17%. Margin for FY ’25 is in line with our longer-term goal of expanding operating margin by a percentage point or 2 each year and represents a 2-point increase from our FY ’24 guide that we communicated at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nGenerators and power systems company Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is highly bullish on.

        "title": "Wisconsin court affirms Amazon Flex drivers were not independent contractors",
        "content": "A Supreme Court action in Wisconsin upholds an earlier ruling that Amazon Flex drivers are employees, not independent contractors.\n\nA group of Amazon drivers who are part of the company’s Flex program have been affirmed by Wisconsin’s Supreme Court to be employees rather than independent contractors.\n\nThe state’s highest court on Wednesday declined to review an appeals court decision from last April that overturned a lower court decision.\n\nA court in Waukesha County had ruled in favor of Amazon (NYSE: AMZN), which argued that its Flex drivers were independent contractors under state regulations. The Court of Appeals for Wisconsin reversed that lower court ruling and held the drivers were employees under state law.\n\nThe Amazon Flex program hires workers (whom Amazon sees as independent contractors) to deliver small packages out of their own cars. There is no Amazon-provided vehicle, and much of the Flex “fleet” is made up of individual automobiles rather than delivery vans.\n\nImmediate issue: unemployment payments\n\nAt the root of the case is a decision handed down by the state’s Department of Workforce Development after an audit of Amazon’s activities in 2016-2018. The finding by the department, and then its affirmation by the state’s Labor and Industrial Review Commission (LIRC), had a practical impact of assessing Amazon slightly more than $200,000 in retroactive unemployment fees that the company had not paid for workers it believed were independent contractors.\n\nWhere the case fits in more broadly is that the ruling was based on how many tests of  Wisconsin’s multipart standard for determining the status of a worker, employee or independent contractor that Amazon could show it had met.\n\nIndependent contractor law often turns on a multipronged test that an employer will be judged on in litigation or regulation. The test determines whether a worker is truly independent or is an employee, regardless of whether the employer classifies that worker as independent.\n\nParallels with federal independent contractor law\n\nThe most controversial classification battle of late has been the test in the federal independent contractor law promulgated by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. There are six factors in the Biden administration’s rule, many of which deal with the issue of control over a worker’s activities..\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trump administration rule it replaced was similar in structure, but the Trump rule gave particular weight to two tests: control and the ability of independent contractors to profit from the level of effort and initiative they put into the job.\n\nThe Biden rule has been dubbed more of a “totality-of-the-circumstances” rule, with all six factors — and a seventh unspecified step opening the door to a wider interpretation — carrying equal weight. As a result, it is viewed as more likely to lead the Wage and Hour Division to find a worker is an employee rather than an independent contractor.\n\nWisconsin independent contractor law also has a multipronged test. One of the prongs in turn has nine definitions that deal with issues such as control, ownership of equipment and whether a worker performing a task ostensibly as an independent contractor has that service on offer to others besides the company employing the worker. Those issues are familiar to any observer of other federal or state standards, including the widely used 11-point Borello test.\n\nGotta have six…\n\nThe Wisconsin regulation is also specific: To qualify as an independent contractor, a worker needs to be in compliance with six of the nine definitions.\n\nAccording to a summary of the case in the appellate court’s decision, LIRC, after getting the case from the Department of Workforce Development, found that Amazon met only one of the tests. Amazon appealed that decision to the Waukesha County Circuit Court, which found that Amazon had met all nine tests.\n\nThe appellate court found several of the nine points where Amazon did meet the burden to show a worker is independent. But the court didn’t find six, the magic number in Wisconsin.\n\nFor example, in Amazon’s favor was the fact that workers could be shown to be using their own vehicles in fulfilling their duties. The court also found that the costs of operations were borne by the Flex drivers. Those were two tests where Amazon passed, supporting the argument that the Flex drivers could be defined as independent.\n\nBut the court also found that Amazon could not show, for example, that the Flex workers had multiple contracts or that they were actively available to offer their delivery services to anyone else, even though wording in the agreement with the drivers says they can do so.\n\nThere also is a test that the employee is performing work that does “not directly relate to the employing unit retaining the services.”\n\nThis echoes the B prong of the ABC test from California and Massachusetts (where it is codified) and New Jersey (where it is in civil law). That prong says for a worker to be deemed an independent contractor, he or she must be offering services that are “outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.”\n\nIt is the B prong that has created difficulties for the California trucking industry because trucking companies often hire independent contractors to move freight, the same business the trucking company operates in.\n\nDelivery vs. logistics\n\n“The services provided by the delivery partners were integrated and interwoven into Amazon Logistics’ business of quickly and efficiently shipping Amazon.com’s products to Amazon.com customers,” the appellate court wrote.\n\nThe court summed up Amazon’s view that the activities of “delivery partners” in the Flex program “[do] not directly relate to its business because the ‘fundamental nature’ of its business is logistics, not delivery.”\n\nAmazon said it does not offer delivery itself but rather fulfills those delivery needs through a variety of service providers, including the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx (NYSE: FDX). (The companies that deliver using Amazon-branded vehicles are almost always owned and operated by an independent company under contract to Amazon.)\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court’s denial of review reverts the case back to the appellate level. In that decision, the court had reversed the Waukesha County order and instructed the lower court to enter an order “consistent with this opinion confirming LIRC’s order,” which requires the payment of the unemployment fees.\n\nBut with precedents like this, findings that a worker is an employee rather than an independent contractor can set the ground for litigation regarding a wide variety of issues, including minimum wage payments and workers’ compensation.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision to “dismiss as improvidently granted” the Amazon case generally comes with no comment from the court. A “DIG” ruling, as it is known, essentially says that while the Wisconsin Supreme Court decided to accept review of a lower case, it should not have done so and is punting the case back to the lower court.\n\nBut in a concurring opinion, Judge Ann Walsh Bradley criticized the court for not offering more details on its reasoning for rejecting further review of the Amazon case. “Without explanation, the court disposes of the case in a two-sentence per curiam decision, dismissing the case as improvidently granted,” she wrote. “Such a dearth of explanation has been the court’s pattern for the past seven years.”\n\nThat led to a concurring opinion by Judge Rebecca Grassl Bradley, who said not commenting on the rationale for rejecting review is standard practice, all the way up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nIn-state Amazon Flex driver prevails in court, can avoid arbitration\n\nBiden administration revising rule on independent contractors\n\nFurther appeals to block AB5 from California trucking seen as a long shot\n\nThe post Wisconsin court affirms Amazon Flex drivers were not independent contractors appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the 20 most expensive countries to get Netflix. If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry, you can directly go to the 5 Most Expensive Countries To Get Netflix.\n\nThe Video Streaming Industry: An Overview\n\nAccording to a report by Grand View Research, the global video streaming market was worth $106.83 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.5% from 2023 to 2030, driven by innovations in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. However, not everything seems to favor the industry right now. According to a Forbes article published on February 2, 2024, 45% of Americans canceled at least one of their streaming subscriptions in the last year because they found the costs to be high. 44% of Forbes' respondents reported that if prices increased, they were most likely to drop their Disney+ subscription, whereas another 40% chose Hulu. Even though Americans continue to pay for an average of 2.9 streaming subscriptions every month, it's clear that interest in the service is dwindling as prices continue to increase.\n\nHow is Netflix Doing?\n\nHowever, as the industry continues to struggle, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has surprised everyone by coming up high. On January 23, 2024, the company reported its statistics for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. According to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), it received 13.1 million subscribers during this period, the largest-ever number for Q4. This brought the total number of subscribers to 260 million. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also mentioned that a significant chunk of its Q4 growth could be attributed to its content and engagement.\n\nThe show Berlin aired on December 29, 2023, and received 46.6 million views in less than a month. Squid Game: The Challenge, a reality TV show based on Netflix’s most-watched show ever, received 34.5 million views within its first two months. The Crown season finale, released on December 14, 2023, generated 30 million views. Other non-English entertainment also performed well; the third season of Lupin generated 50 million views, whereas the Spanish film Nowhere received 85.7 million views. Even animated films managed to sustain a massive chunk of the audience; for example, Adam Sandler’s Leo was watched by 108.1 million individuals.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithin the Q4 shareholder letter, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stated that starting in January 2025, WWE’s Raw will become live on Netflix in the US, Canada, the UK, and Latin America, with other regions being added in the future. In the same month, Netflix will also start airing other WWE specials, shows, and live sports events, such as SmackDown, Wrestlemania, and Royal Rumble. Lastly, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also revealed that engagement had tripled for its games offerings in the last year. In Q4 of 2023, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) launched the Grand Theft Auto series from Rockstar Games, which has become its most successful gaming launch to date. So, even though the games section at Netflix is still new and growing, it does offer promising results for the company going forward. Check out 30 Best War Movies on Netflix Now.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) logged modest growth in Q4 2023. On January 23, the company reported that it generated a revenue of $8.83 billion in Q4 2023, up 12.49% year over year, and outperformed market consensus by $120.38 million. Here are some comments from the company's Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"I'm going to say instead that we are thrilled to bring this WWE Live programming to our members around the world. WWE Raw is sports entertainment, which is right in the sweet spot of our sports business, which is the drama of sport. Think of this as 52 weeks of live programming every week, every year. It feeds our desire to expand our live event programming. But most importantly, fans love it. For decades, the WWE has grown this multigenerational fan base that we believe we could serve and we can grow. We believe that WWE has been historically under distributed outside of North America.\n\nAnd this is a global deal. So we can help them and they can help us build that fandom around the world. And not to - I should add that this should also add some fuel to our new and growing ad business. We're very excited about this deal.\"\n\nA Worthy Competitor\n\nWhile Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) continues to be one of the leading companies in the video streaming industry, a close competitor is Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video. On February 1, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) released its fourth-quarter results, and announced several promising achievements for Prime Video. Thursday Night Football (TNF) grew the total viewership for its second season by a 24% year-on-year growth. The Seahawks-Cowboys game, which took place on November 30 and generated 15.3 million in viewership, became Prime’s most-watched TNF match ever. Additionally, the company generated a revenue of $169.69 billion, up 13.91% year over year and ahead of consensus by $3.70 billion. The group's advertising revenue grew by 27% year over year and amounted to $14.6 billion for the quarter. Here's what Andrew Jassy, the company's CEO, said during the Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n\"We've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business. While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach and engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV, and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football.\"\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also reported that Amazon MGM Studios released 16 films and series in Q4. This included the second season of Invincible, which became the most-viewed animated series on Prime Video, globally speaking. More than 60 Amazon Originals from countries other than the US were also added to the roster in this quarter. The company also grew its sports-related offerings by adding several sports documentaries and new broadcast rights for various sports leagues, such as the National Women’s Soccer League. On March 19, 2024, Amazon MGM Studios announced a partnership with the YouTuber Mr. Beast to release a reality competition series, Beast Games. The show will consist of 1,000 contestants fighting for a prize of $5 million, making this the biggest reality competition series in history based on single-prize value.\n\nDespite the many cancellations in 2023, Nielsen published a report in January 2024 that showed that Americans streamed content worth 21 million years in 2023. This was a 21% increase from 2022, when the value was 17 million years. Thus, even though streaming services are going through a bit of a rough patch due to rising prices, providers like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue finding ways to stay afloat. This often happens through price hikes, several of which have been seen across platforms in previous years. Based on this scenario, we have compiled a list of the 20 most expensive countries to get Netflix, where viewers might struggle due to extravagant prices.\n\nYou can also take a look at the 50 Best Heist Movies of All Time and 20 Best Serial Killer Documentaries on Netflix and Other Streaming Services.  20 Most Expensive Countries to Get Netflix\n\n20 Most Expensive Countries to Get Netflix\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to rank the 20 most expensive countries for a Netflix subscription, we sourced our data directly from the Netflix website.

Belgium\n\nBasic Plan: $9.74\n\nStandard Plan: $14.61\n\nPremium Plan: $19.49\n\nBelgium is one of the most expensive countries to get a Netflix subscription, with the premium plan costing $19.50.

The two movies have been among the top 10 for five weeks in total.\n\n18. Denmark\n\nBasic Plan: $11.47\n\nStandard Plan: $16.56\n\nPremium Plan: $21.64\n\nIn Denmark, extra member slots in the standard and premium accounts can be added for an additional $5.66 monthly.

Faroe Islands\n\nBasic Plan: $11.47\n\nStandard Plan: $16.56\n\nPremium Plan: $21.64\n\nThe Faroe Islands make up one of the most expensive places to get Netflix. The plans are based on the Danish pricing model, as the islands are under the external sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark. However, subscribers in the region do not have the option of adding extra member slots on the standard and premium plans.\n\n16. Greenland\n\nBasic Plan: $11.47\n\nStandard Plan: $16.56\n\nPremium Plan: $21.64\n\nGreenland is one of the most expensive regions to get a Netflix subscription, with the premium plan amounting to $21.64.

This showcases that Netflix's pricing strategies are based on individual conditions within each territory. Extra member slots cost $6.49 a month on the premium and standard plan.\n\n12. Ireland\n\nBasic Plan: $9.74\n\nStandard Plan: $16.24\n\nPremium Plan: $22.74\n\nEven though Ireland's standard and premium plans are more expensive, its basic plan is cheaper than those in the previous two countries.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at 20 countries that receive the most foreign direct investment. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Receive the Most Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nAn Analysis of the World’s Foreign Investment\n\nThe global investment landscape was gloomy in 2022, mainly due to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, turbulence in financial markets, and climate change causing investment uncertainty around the globe. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) suffered due to economic volatility but remained more resilient than expected. According to IMF’s World Investment Report 2023, the global FDI amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2022 after declining 12 percentage points from the previous year. Despite the decline, investment inflows to the developing countries increased marginally; however, growth was concentrated in a few emerging economies. On the other hand, the FDI to the least developed countries declined, with FDI in 46 least developed countries falling to $22 billion after a decrease of 16%. Investors ended the year by announcing new industrial and infrastructural projects. To read more about investments, you can look at 12 Fastest Growing Sectors and Investment Opportunities in the US and 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.\n\nThe greenfield investment trends presented a bright spot for the international investment landscape, with the number of new projects increasing by 15% for 2022 and in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The FDI and the number of new greenfield projects also increased in developing countries. The FDI in developing countries increased by 4%, reaching $916 billion. Meanwhile, the number of new greenfield project announcements witnessed a 37% increase, thereby signaling a positive indication for investment prospects in industry and infrastructure.\n\nMoving forward, foreign direct investment is expected to increase modestly in 2024. On January 17, Reuters reported that the United Nations trade body was positive about global FDI rising modestly in 2024. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the projections for inflation and the cost of borrowing in the major markets indicate stabilization to attract international investment deals, thereby increasing global FDI in 2024. The organization, however, stressed that the geopolitical risks and high debt levels in some countries could hinder the prospects of FDI. In 2023, the foreign direct investment amounted to approximately $1.37 trillion, a marginal increase of 3% from the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Country that Attracts the Most FDI: The United States\n\nThe United States is one of the largest hosts of foreign direct investment and has announced several greenfield projects and international infrastructural and industrial deals. Some of the top companies in the US market that are driving economic growth include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

The company's revenue for the quarter grew by 13.91% year-over-year and amounted to $169.96 billion, ahead of market consensus by $3.70 billion. Here are some comments from Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings call for Q4 2023:\n\nThese events also helped attract new customers and Prime members. Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we’ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is another multinational technology company based in the United States. The company is renowned for its wide range of platforms, services, and products, including Google Cloud, Google Search engine, and Android. Alphabet Inc.

Here are some comments from Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings call for Q4 2023:\n\nThis infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It’s a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You’ve heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures.

        "title": "20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will be navigating through global homelessness while covering the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World.\n\nOverview of Global Homelessness\n\nAs reported by the United Nations, homelessness is the deprivation of stable, safe, and adequate housing without being able to obtain it. The concept extends from a lack of physical shelter to social exclusion. Homeless groups include people living in open spaces, streets, temporary emergency accommodations, shelters, camps, as well as informal settlements.\n\nThe World Economic Forum reports that approximately 150 million people were homeless around the world in 2021. This equates to 2% of the global population without considering the fact that this doesn’t represent real statistics since measuring homelessness is daunting. The global pandemic worsened the state of homelessness worldwide. This was when economies struggled against the lasting impacts of lockdowns and soaring poverty. In this regard, countries have been fighting their battles against homelessness. While modular mini-homes were provided to the homeless in the UK, shipping containers were used to make an apartment complex for the homeless residing in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nHomelessness: A Univeral Fight\n\nThe United Nations has referred to homelessness as a harmful form of systemic discrimination that impacts people in both developed and developing countries. Previously, we have also discussed the countries with the highest homeless population. Representing developing countries and China, Guyana’s representative exclaimed that homelessness has experienced a rise over the years. In African nations such as Angola, rural poverty primarily drives homelessness. Apart from social inequality and poverty, climate change serves as another cause of homelessness. Small island developing states have been prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and storms which massively destroy the social infrastructure while displacing many. Temporary housing and relocation assistance become crucial ways to address disaster-related displacement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the contrary, the developed United States also continues to find ways to tackle the homeless crisis in the country. On March 22, Reuters reported that more than 653,000 people in America were homeless in 2023, recording a 12% year-over-year increase since 2022. Diverse strategies are being proposed to combat this homelessness. While legislation related to banning people from camping on city sidewalks, parks, and public places was signed in Florida, more than $20 billion has been spent on housing and homelessness programs in California since 2018. Policy experts are of the opinion that access to affordable housing is a better solution rather than clearances that cannot function for a long time. In conclusion, the opposition between a crackdown on camping and raising funding to accommodate the homeless continues across the nation. You can also view the states with the highest homeless population and the cities with the largest homeless populations in the US to have a better understanding of homelessness in the country.\n\nMultinationals Combating Homelessness\n\nBuilding upon the rising crisis of homelessness penetrating America, local companies continue to address the issue. American companies engaging in the nation’s battle against homelessness include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThe e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) caters to housing affordability and accessibility issues, especially for the deprived. The company’s Housing Equity Fund offers more than $2 billion in below-market loans and grants for 20,000 affordable homes for low-to-middle-income families in the local communities. In collaboration with minority-led organizations, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested more than $760 million in the creation and preservation of 4,500 affordable homes. Partnerships with public transit agencies have also been undertaken to introduce cheap housing near high-capacity public transit areas.\n\nAnother company ensuring affordability for housing is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company unveiled its Affordable Housing Initiative back in 2019 under which it aimed to fix the shortage of housing and the resulting high prices in Puget Sound region. The region also hosts many people living unsheltered. The company granted $1.5 million in an effort to reduce homelessness across King County.  The firm also supports organizations involved in providing permanent shelter to the homeless and essential services to get people back on their feet. Extending its initiative, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested $583 million to create and preserve 9,200 housing units in the Puget Sound region.\n\nHomelessness in California was catered to by the leading tech company Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company has committed $2.5 billion to improve the housing crisis across California. The task of constructing affordable housing for the unhoused or those who face the risk of losing their house is being undertaken by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with its community partners. The company is working towards the construction of new homes for 20,000 individuals and another 24,000 to help them stay housed while they are subject to the danger of becoming homeless. It has also helped the nonprofit Home expand its Homelessness Prevention System which provides direct financial assistance.\n\nNow that we have taken a look at global homelessness and the ongoing fight against it, let’s move to the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world. 20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World\n\n20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 20 countries with the lowest homeless population in the world, we sourced the most recent data on homelessness from the OECD. We have ranked the countries on our list in descending order of their homelessness to depict the lowest statistics for homelessness across the world. The homeless population for all the countries has been cited from the latest available year as reported by the OECD.\n\n20 Countries with the Lowest Homeless Population in the World\n\n20.

        "content": "If you’re searching for cheap blue-chip stocks to buy, look no further. Blue-chip stocks continue to lag the performance of growth stocks. Although it is currently at an all-time high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprised of 30 blue-chip names, is up only 4% this year compared to an 11% gain in the technology-laden Nasdaq index. While some blue-chip stocks are performing strongly, many well-known companies are seeing their share price slide lower and badly lagging the market’s overall performance. The declines, while notable, should be seen as a buying opportunity in many instances.\n\nSome of the stocks that are down this year are struggling with short-term issues that are beyond the company’s control. In time, the situation should resolve itself and the share price should move higher. It’s also good to have blue-chip stocks in one’s portfolio as these securities can be defensive in times when the market drops or the economy falters. Plus, stalwart blue-chip stocks are more likely to pay dividends than fast-growing tech stocks and start-up companies. Buying when prices are down and riding them higher should be the goal of every investor.\n\nHere are seven blue-chip stocks to buy at or near their 52-week low in March.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: McDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nThe Golden Arches is as blue-chip as stocks come. The hamburger and restaurant chain has been a reliable performer for decades, trades at a reasonable 24 times future earnings estimates, and pays a quarterly dividend that yields a strong 2.40%. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has raised its dividend payment every year since 1976. Yet MCD stock has struggled in recent years. Year-to-date (YTD), the share price is down 6%. Over five years, it is up only 45%.\n\nThe softness in MCD stock is curious given that the company is in the midst of an aggressive growth strategy, with plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. McDonald’s also continues to diversify its menu, recently announcing that it will sell Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) doughnuts at its more than 13,500 restaurants across America.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while news of the Krispy Kreme partnership sent DNUT stock up 30% in one day, it barely moved the needle on MCD stock. Time to buy the dip.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nArguably the best deal in the market right now is the stock of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The consumer electronics giant’s share price is down nearly 10% on the year and not far from its 52-week low. Slowing sales in China and an antirust lawsuit filed against it by the U.S. Justice Department have pushed AAPL stock down since the start of the year. Smart investors will treat the decline as a buying opportunity.\n\nDespite the headwinds it faces, Apple continues to keep its business chugging along. In recent weeks, the company announced that it plans to start selling its new Vision Pro augmented reality headset in China. Also, Apple is reportedly in talks to license Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) technology from Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and integrate it into future iPhones.\n\nThe addition of AI sets up iPhone for potentially its biggest upgrade in years and could give the smartphone a whole new competitive advantage.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nA huge buy-the-dip opportunity has opened up with the stock of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) after the company’s latest earnings print. LULU stock fell more than 10% after the retailer issued weak forward guidance and said that its North American sales are slowing. The post-earnings decline has dragged the share price 23% lower year to date. However, this popular athletic apparel maker’s stock is not likely to be down for long.\n\nWhile it is true that Lululemon’s North American sales have decelerated, the company is killing it with its international expansion. For the final quarter of 2023, the company’s international sales grew 54% year-over-year, with sales in the key market of China increasing 78%. Lululemon’s total sales, North America included, were up 16% from a year ago. The strong international growth and overall growth are not reflected in LULU stock.\n\nLululemon also continues to expand beyond its traditional focus on women consumers, moving into men’s wear and launching in February a new line of men’s sneakers. Sneakers and casual footwear, both men’s and women’s, represent a huge new market for Lululemon Athletica.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nCan software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) survive an existential threat posed by AI? That’s the question facing the company as its share price has fallen 13% so far in 2024. ADBE stock began to sink after privately held OpenAI launched a new text-to-video generator that competes against its own creative software products that include Photoshop and Illustrator. The situation hasn’t been helped by Adobe’s latest earnings print.\n\nAdobe offered up forward guidance that disappointed analysts on Wall Street. The company also got dinged for canceling its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee. The guidance and Figma fee overshadowed the fact that Adobe reported strong financial results that beat analyst forecasts. The company also announced a $25 billion stock buyback program.\n\nAdobe is not taking the threat from OpenAI and other competitors lying down. Over the last year, the company has added AI features to many of its software products, including an image editing tool called Firefly.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Hershey (HSY) The entrance to the Hershey factory in downtown Hershey, Pennsylvania. HSY stock.\n\nSource: George Sheldon / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe’re heading into the Easter long weekend, and one would assume that this would be a great time to be a shareholder of Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY). After all, Americans spent $3.3 billion on Easter chocolate and candy in 2023, up 8.2% from the previous year. Sadly though, there is not much reason to celebrate the Easter Bunny’s arrival this year. Not with cocoa prices trading at an all-time high and above $10,000 per metric ton for the first time ever.\n\nRecord prices for cocoa is a huge problem for Hershey, which spends more than $1 billion a year on the active ingredient in chocolate. Cocoa prices have risen 40% this year due to global supply constraints. The problem lies in the Ivory Coast of Africa, which is the biggest cocoa producer in the world. The region has been hit by both flooding and hotter-than-usual temperatures that are causing drought conditions and diminishing crop yields.\n\nThe flooding and excessive heat has also led to an outbreak of cacao swollen shoot virus that is harming the cocoa crop. The world’s supply of cocoa is now on course for a third straight annual supply deficit. The worsening problem has HSY stock down 24% over the last 12 months and not far from its 52-week low. But long-term, Hershey remains a solid investment. Here’s hoping cocoa prices move lower before Halloween.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, Florida\n\nSource: saaton / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe’re barely through one quarter of the year, and already 2024 has been tough on pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). In early January, the company cut its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%, sending WBA stock plunging. Then, the company was kicked out of the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), further hurting its share price.\n\nThe net effect is that WBA stock is down 23% on the year. That brings its 12-month decline to nearly 40%. While things look dark for Walgreens, there are some faint glimmers of light starting to shine on the company and its stock. The company has a new CEO named Tim Wentworth who took the helm in October of last year. He has already undertaken a turnaround plan that included cutting the dividend to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and preserve cash.\n\nAdditionally, Walgreens’ most recent earnings beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The strong print was a reversal for Walgreens, which had missed earnings estimates in the two previous quarters. It will take time, but WBA stock could come back.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow low can Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock go? A lot lower according to analysts who cover the company. Down nearly 30% on the year, TSLA stock is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 index. However, each day seems to bring a new analyst downgrade for the stock. Most recently, analysts at Bernstein lowered their price target on Tesla’s shares to $120 from $150 and reiterated a “sell” equivalent rating.\n\nBernstein, and others, are worried about slumping global demand for Tesla’s electric vehicles, especially in China. They’re also seeing weak demand for Tesla’s Model 3 electric vehicle stateside. The piling on has hurt investor sentiment related to TSLA stock and pushed the share price lower. Approaching a 52-week low, and with its market capitalization sliding to $500 billion, its fair to wonder, what’s next for Tesla?\n\nDespite the glum situation, there’s every reason for investors to buy-the-dip in TSLA stock. The company is taking steps to right the ship, including raising prices and offering a free trial of its full self-driving feature. Also, the stock has fallen sharply in the past and always comes roaring back. This time is likely to be no different.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

        "title": "Why Amazon’s multi-billion dollar AI alliance with Anthropic isn’t the game-changer it needs to remain king of the cloud",
        "content": "When Amazon announced Wednesday that it had showered the hot AI startup Anthropic with an additional $2.75 billion to complete the $4 billion investment it had announced last fall, the company positioned the news as a royal win.\n\nAmazon's AWS, the king of cloud computing (with nearly a third of global market share), was deepening its partnership with Anthropic, the number two prince (Harry, not William) of generative AI foundation models. Under the pact, Anthropic will use AWS as its “primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads,” and train and deploy its future AI models on Amazon's homegrown chips, while AWS customers get access to future generations of Anthropic's AI technology.\n\nLook more closely however, and the deal seems less like a sign of Amazon perpetuating its cloud dominance into the Gen AI era, and more like a hint at how vulnerable the company has become in a shifting landscape.\n\nAmazon, considered a laggard in the race to deploy generative AI technology, really needs Anthropic's highly-touted models, including the most recent Claude 3. At the same time though, Amazon is hitching its cart to an AI startup that, while boasting impressive technology, will not instantly distinguish or differentiate Amazon from the competition — since Google is also an Anthropic partner.\n\nPairing up with Anthropic is a necessary and beneficial move for Amazon. But with the AWS empire under siege, the question is whether the deal is too little too late.\n\nA 'shiny engine' versus a Rolls Royce\n\nAWS continues to be the reigning champion of the cloud business, with 31% global market share in 2023’s fourth quarter. But the race is getting tighter. Microsoft Azure, AWS's biggest cloud competitor, has edged closer with 24%, while Google Cloud has 11%. Both Microsoft and Google have seen cloud growth thanks to their Gen AI offerings — the former with its powerhouse partnership with OpenAI, and the latter with its Bard and Gemini AI momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Forrester principal analyst Tracy Woo, Amazon’s Gen AI efforts have not been very impressive. “It took three, four months [for Amazon] to come up with any sort of generative AI-specific announcements [in 2023],” Woo told Fortune, adding that the results were “really lackluster.”\n\nThe announcements at Amazon's Re:invent conference in December 2023 — including Amazon Q, a generative AI work assistant, and next generation AWS-designed chips — should have been a “resounding response to show that you’re firmly back as the number one cloud provider that everyone looks to,\" Woo said. Instead, it was “underwhelming\" — especially given the competition with Microsoft, and its alliance with OpenAI.\n\nAmazon announced the equivalent of a shiny engine, wheel and pane of glass for the windows, while Microsoft “came out with a Rolls Royce” — marketing its Copilot offering for Azure and OpenAI models like a car that “flies, it goes in the water, it is incredible.”\n\nMicrosoft's bread-and-butter has always been software packages and solutions that slot perfectly into the enterprise workflow, so it's not surprising that the company made such a strong showing.  But Amazon's underwhelming announcements underscored how mismatched the cloud competitors remain when it comes to the software side of things.\n\nThe AWS strong suit has always been infrastructure. And leveraging that skillset to differentiate is one way Amazon could try to get an edge. But there's danger there too, thanks to the rise of Nvidia, whose GPUs rule the roost, and are only getting better with Blackwell, the new Nvidia AI chip announced at its GTC conference.\n\nWhile it’s possible for Amazon to pull off an infrastructure cloud play, said Woo, the company  would have to “do things differently.”\n\n“Everyone builds on CUDA,” she said. “So to ask everyone to rearrange their software architecture so they can cater to these AI-based TPUs that AWS has come up with is a huge ask.”\n\nDon't count out the cloud king\n\nAt this point, AWS is arguably behind in both AI infrastructure and AI software, but no one should count out the cloud king, Woo emphasized. While Amazon “missed the boat” on recognizing that the cloud race was no longer at the infrastructure — but had moved up the stack to AI-powered software solutions — she added that with AWS, “anything is possible.”\n\n“I see this as a little bit of a desperation call from [Amazon CEO Andy] Jassy responding to his shareholders,” she said. “[AWS CEO] Adam Selipsky…really understands the market and so I have a lot of confidence that he can steer the ship in the right direction.” Of course, Amazon has never been identified as the AI cloud king — “so they have a huge uphill battle ahead of them,” she added. “But I think they are resilient. They are an aggressive company that moves aggressively — they are not fat and happy.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best 5G stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more such companies, go directly to the 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominating headlines, another technological advancement is quietly gaining momentum and warrants investors' attention: 5G technology. Representing the next generation of mobile internet, 5G is poised to replace 4G, offering ultra-fast speeds and significantly lower latency, enhancing communication time between devices.\n\nEricsson, a telecommunications company, stated in its mobility report that by 2028, 5G will emerge as the primary mobile access technology by subscription. Globally, 5G subscriptions are expected to surpass 5.3 billion in 2029, constituting 58% of all mobile subscriptions at that point. Further projections indicate that by 2029, North America and the GCC will boast the highest 5G penetration at 92%, followed closely by Western Europe at 85%.\n\nOf course, while the penetration of 5G connectivity is expected to open up new growth opportunities in both hardware and software sectors, a 2020 report by Edward Jones highlighted that the full realization of 5G may take considerable time due to the complexity of its technical infrastructure requirements. The report emphasized that the deployment of 5G would not reach completion levels until software developers conduct extensive testing and exploration to determine the most effective utilization of the high speeds and responsiveness unlocked by 5G technology. Consumer sentiment echoes this observation, with many 5G smartphone users indicating that their devices have yet to fully leverage the capabilities of the technology. Deloitte's research reveals that a significant majority (53%) of 5G smartphone users are actively looking for applications and experiences that can harness the advanced capabilities of the network. Additionally, a notable 26% expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of innovative apps and services specifically designed for the 5G environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors should take note that despite the short-term headwinds in the 5G sector, such as those experienced by Nokia this past year, the economic benefits of the 5G revolution are expected to be far and wide. Grand View Research projects that the 5G services market will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 59.4% from 2023 to 2030. This growth trajectory is anticipated to be driven b y the convergence of other sub-sectors of technology, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and high-speed data connectivity, which collectively will catalyze market expansion.\n\nInvestors looking to capitalize on the potential of 5G should adopt a diversified strategy by investing in various sectors of the 5G ecosystem. This includes companies involved in providing 5G network equipment, tower infrastructure, semiconductors, hyperscalers, and mobile network operators. In that regard, some of the best 5G stocks to buy include the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 most undervalued retail stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the retail industry, go directly to the 5 Most Undervalued Retail Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAccording to Economic Intelligence’s consumer goods and retail outlook 2024 report, in 2024, global retail sales are projected to grow by 6.7%, with a 2% increase in volume due to a slowdown in inflation. Despite this growth, some challenges remain due to depleted household savings and high food prices, especially in developing economies. Additionally, the report states that online sales are expected to see double-digit growth in 2024, reaching 14.6% of total global retail sales. However, online retailers will continue to face challenges in maintaining profitability due to some regulatory issues.\n\nThe online retail industry experienced significant declines after its February 2021 highs. While the industry is still a long way from complete recovery, it still showed decent performance over the last 12 months. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY) is still 58.5% lower than its February 12, 2021 levels but has gained 38.21% in the last 12 months, compared to 27.20% gains of SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) and S&P 500’s 30.82% gains, as of March 26 market close.\n\nFuture of Retail According to Retail Executives\n\nOn February 16, CNBC shared the predictions of top retail executives that included Abercrombie & Fitch Co.’s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz, Levi Strauss & Co.’s (NYSE:LEVI) CEO, Michelle Gass, chief e-commerce officer of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and a few others.\n\nThe executives mentioned that the retail landscape is shifting towards smaller, omnichannel stores that are strategically located to align with what customers want and need. The retail spaces will be set up to run smoothly and will guarantee a hassle-free shopping experience. Additionally, traditional brick-and-mortar stores are transforming into engaging places that offer immersive experiences and much more than the typical shopping trip to captivate customers' senses. Abercrombie & Fitch Co.’s (NYSE:ANF) CEO, Fran Horowitz said:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The future of retail is small, efficient, omni stores, and they’re located where the customer tells us. [For Abercrombie] these big, massive stores were just not productive and not efficient — the consumer was responding to a much more intimate associate experience, and then economically, they were not productive. You don’t get the kind of traffic through the stores like you did in the past when there wasn’t a digital option, so you have to provide a location that is financially sound, which has X amount of traffic and X amount of digital orders that come together.”\n\nAdditionally, the executives emphasized the role of AI in the future of retail. They said that AI will reshape retail through personalized experiences owing to data analysis. Advanced algorithms will deliver tailored recommendations and promotions and that will improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Additionally, AI will help with the seamless integration of online and offline channels, which will make transitions for shoppers much easier. This can enhance convenience and flexibility and encourage customers to engage with retailers across various platforms. As CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI), Michelle Gass said:\n\n“If you think about the technology today, broadly speaking, a lot of what you might see in the personalization is, okay, if you’re an avid buyer of [Levi’s] 501s [jeans], you might get a recommendation on the next exciting wash of a 501, or something similar. But I think where the technology is going to go is it’s going to be able to leap into something like, to go from you’re a 501 shopper to this is going to be the perfect denim skirt for you and make bolder leaps, but do it in a way that’s informed based on your shopping history and who you are.”\n\nThe executives also stated that sustainability and inclusivity are some of the top priorities in retail, with a focus on inclusive sizing and sustainable practices like using eco-friendly materials and ethical sourcing. Sam’s Club CEO Chris Nicholas mentioned that renewable energy and electric vehicles are going to become vastly important in the future of retail. On December 13, Walmart Canada announced putting Canada’s first electric semi-trucks on the road. According to the company, each of the trucks will travel around 68,000 miles annually. On top of that, these trucks will save around 100,000 liters of fuel annually.\n\nRecent Updates on Major Retail Companies\n\nOne of the best discount retailer stocks and the largest retailer in the world, Walmart Inc.

One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023.

(NYSE:KR). As of March 26, the stock has an average price target of $58.50 and a high forecast of $70.00. At the time of writing, the stock has surged more than 22% year-to-date.\n\nOakmark Funds mentioned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) (U.S.) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons could accelerate the company’s earnings growth and produce additional scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”\n\n9. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)\n\nPE as of March 26: 17.54\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nDollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the most famous discount retailers in the US and offers a wide range of products, including but not limited to consumables, seasonal items, home products, etc. The company sells its products under various brands, namely Dollar General, Clover Valley, Smart & Simple, and more. It is the 9th most undervalued retail stock on our list.\n\nOn March 15, Morgan Stanley raised the price target on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) to $170 from $160 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. As of March 26, the stock has a PE ratio of 17.54.\n\nHedge fund sentiment was positive toward Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in Q4 of 2023. In the quarter, hedge funds with investments in the stock were 47, with positions worth $1.25 billion. This is compared to 38 funds with positions worth $1.13 billion in the third quarter. Holocene Advisors is the top investor in the company and has a position worth $257.206 million as of Q4 of 2023.\n\nArtisan Partners stated the following regarding Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our biggest full-year detractors included energy holdings Schlumberger and EOG and 2023 purchases Baxter International and Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG). Dollar General, a discount retail chain in the US, has dealt with a few struggles. The retailer had previously benefited from COVID stimulus checks, reflected in the bump it experienced in revenues and margins. However, the effects have worn off, and its core consumer has been hurt by inflation, stiffer economic conditions, lower tax refunds and reduced SNAP benefits. Margins are also under pressure due to labor costs, shrink and markdowns. Some of the issues are likely self-inflicted. After years of focusing on store growth to drive the top line, store standards have suffered. Addressing store standards is needed to turn around flagging traffic, comps and customer satisfaction. On the positive side, discount retail due to its trade-down feature tends to be a defensive business during economic slowdowns. Dollar General has a strong market position and faces less competition than other discounters due to its largely rural footprint. The business’s value proposition is everyday low prices, a convenient format and proximity. The company has leverage due to capital expenditures, but interest coverage of ~9X is strong. From a valuation perspective, the froth from the pandemic, when it traded in the low- to mid-twenties, is gone. So, we aren’t paying for margin upside or store growth. Those would be bonuses. If the company can continue to grow revenues, generate cash flow and buy back stock, we still see a path to success.”\n\n8. Bath & Body Works, Inc.

        "title": "Walgreens Is Paying A Hefty Cost For Its Healthcare Transformation But It's Not Giving Up Despite Scary Competition From Amazon",
        "content": "Like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) is going for its piece of the healthcare pie. With its fiscal second quarter report, it topped estimates, but lowered the higher end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance in response to a challenging macroeconomy. The new CEO, Tim Wentworth, continues to navigate the company out of a rough spot by slashing costs and solidifying the leadership team, but the company's healthcare transformation took its toll on the bottom line.\n\nFiscal second quarter highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on February 29th, Walgreens recorded sales grew about 6.3% to $37.05 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $35.86 billion as sales grew across its three business segments. U.S. retail pharmacy segment brought in $28.86 billion as revenue grew almost 5%.\n\nWhat particularly stood up is the U.S. health-care division whose sales expanded 33% YoY to $2.18 billion, owed to VillageMD’s acquisition of multispecialty care provider Summit Health and business growth on a pro-forma basis. Same clinic growth fueled VillageMD sales which grew 20%. New contracts and current partnershuip expansions fueled the segment’s specialty pharmacy company, Shields Health Solutions, to 13% growth.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $1.20 also topped LSEG’s estimate of 82 cents.\n\nBut due to a hefty nearly $6 billion charge related to the decline in value of its investment in primary-care provider VillageMD, Walgreens posted a steep net loss of  $5.91 billion, or $6.85 per share, swinging from last year’s comparable quarter for which it made a net income of $703 million, or 81 cents per share.\n\nThe net loss reflected the hefty cost Walgreens is paying for its transformation from being a major drugstore chain into becoming a large health-care company. However, CFO Manmohan Mahajan emphasized that VillageMD chargeis not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s financial position, or its ability to invest across businesses going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nWalgreens narrowed its prior fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings guidance range from $3.20 to $3.35 per share, lowering the higher end from $3.50 per share due to hurdles retailers are facing amid an unfavorable economy, among other factors.\n\nWalgreens is reshaping its strategy along the way.\n\nWalgreens has been having a hard time over the last few years, and the battle is to become even harder with Amazon announcing its entry into the immediate delivery pharmacy market. Amazon announced the expansion of same day delivery service for Amazon Pharmacy in New York and Los Angeles. But, getting a piece of the $4.5 trillion healthcare industry doesn’t not come easy even for Amazon. Even the mighty e-commerce titan found its primary care strategy difficult to scale.\n\nLast year, Walgreens shares tanked 30% last year in response to plummeting demand for Covid products, low pharmacy reimbursement rates, along with its unsteady push into health care amid an unstable U.S. economy. With the ongoing cost savings program that includes trimming its workforce, closing unprofitable stores and using AI to boost the efficiency of its supply chain, Walgreens reiterated it is on track to meet its goal of saving $1 billion during fiscal 2024, as it continues seeking innovative ways to boost profitability and growth of its retail pharmacy division. With Amazon’s latest move, Walgreens’ challenges only got worse.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nGrowth Outperforms in 2023 and Beyond\n\nInvesting in growth stocks is a good way to bolster your portfolio with high-profit names. Traditionally, growth stocks are companies that quickly grow their sales and earnings relative to the market, making them highly attractive to investors. But on the flipside, these stocks typically have incredibly high valuations and P/E ratios, which may discourage some investors looking for less expensive stocks. However, if you're an investor who is willing to commit to a higher valuation in exchange for quick profits and gains, growth stocks may be the best for you.\n\nLast year, growth stocks outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin. According to a Bloomberg article published this January, the S&P 500 Growth Index actually saw gains of 30% for 2023 compared to the broader benchmark index's 22% gain for the year. This performance came as a shock to many investors, considering the fact that the Federal Reserve was on a rate-hiking journey for most of the year, and traditionally, growth is expected to underperform in periods of rising interest rates. This stellar performance has resulted in growth stocks acquiring somewhat of a reliable appearance, leading to many investors in 2024 continuing to stick with their growth picks over their value counterparts.\n\nFor example, UBP's Head of Equity Research for Asia, Kieran Calder, joined Bloomberg on January 3 and stated that US growth stocks are at present a \"better bet\" for investors, with Calder himself preferring growth over value stocks in 2024. One of the major growth sectors in the market today is the technology sector with its exponential growth in light of the rise of artificial intelligence. According to Calder, for investors today, the following are the places to be in high-growth tech:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"One is the Magnificent Seven, and we think these should probably be core holdings in a portfolio, but we also expect kind of a broadening out into, let's say, software names within tech, which have underperformed over the court of last year. But we'll be able to use and get improved earnings on the back of implementation of AI, for example, and more cloud adoption. So we think that the second tier of cloud and AI names is a good place to start to look for more ideas within US tech.\"\n\nIn keeping with the above, our list of the best growth stocks to buy today also has several major tech names in it, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). For growth investors looking to identify key investment areas within tech, it would be necessary to first identify the main themes within the tech sector in terms of what will drive the sector's growth the most in 2024 and beyond. According to BlackRock Active Equity Group's Ben Bei, there are three major themes in this sector: AI, cloud computing, and electric and autonomous vehicles. These areas offer the most interesting investment opportunities for investors today and are thus worth taking a look at.\n\nSmall-Cap Growth Stocks On The Rise\n\nWhen most investors think about growth stocks, especially in the tech sector, what comes to mind is usually large or mega-cap stocks with enormous valuations and market capitalizations. However, the trend in growth stock performance this year is showing that even small-cap growth stocks are on the rise and are performing spectacularly. On February 29, Fairlead Strategies' Founder and Managing Partner, Katie Stockton, joined CNBC's \"Last Call\" to offer some insights on this development. Here's what she said:\n\n\"We've seen very concentrated outperformance in the small-cap arena from growth stocks, so more than just Supermicro and Viking Therapeutics. We have broad participation from growth more broadly and that includes a lot of biotechnology stocks, a lot of technology stocks, and I actually see that as a risk on move. A risk on indication shows an appetite for these names that previously were out of favor. You could say that about even the Russell 2000 Index, that the small-cap benchmark had been out of favor for some time. And now it's showing some signs of life and relative strength, when you compare it to the S&P 500.\"\n\nThis improvement in the performance of small-cap growth stocks alongside the usual suspects is proving to be encouraging for investors. As such, many investors are looking for some of the best growth stocks to buy, which is why we have compiled our list below. Our list of the best growth stocks includes some of the best stocks for long-term growth and some of the fastest growing technology companies in the US today. 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now\n\nA close-up of a portfolio of stocks, emphasizing the broad equity portfolio of the company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the best growth stocks to invest in now, we consulted the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF. We shortlisted the stocks for our list by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. We also mentioned the share price gains of these stocks year-to-date as of March 28.

        "title": "Zscaler Is Attractively Valued Amid Growing Digital Reliance",
        "content": "Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has one of the highest growth rates in its industry, based on my analysis of dominant peers. As such, I consider it a significant investment in artificieal intelligecne-integrated cybersecurity, with a particular moat in how it protects cloud operations. However, fast-changing digital landscapes, as they relate to the increased abilities of AI, could pose significant risks for shareholders. This needs to be monitored carefully.\n\nOverview of operations\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ZS.\n\nFounded in 2007, the company describes itself as the world's largest any-to-any security cloud platform. Its most valuable operational asset at this time is the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, which is a cybersecurity suite that operates under the fundamental tenet of trusting no one and verifying everything. This model treats all users and devices as potential threats, whether they are inside or outside of a network. The platform is cloud-native, meaning it is built and run on the cloud, which facilitates better scalability, performance and security.\n\nI believe this technology is particularly important at a time when work environments are becoming increasingly hybridized, with some organizations opting for fully remote working conditions. Increased cybersecurity as a result of the high load of digital transactions of often sensitive data requires advanced systems of protection against data extraction, malware and other corruption of digital workflows.\n\nZscaler has countless technology partners, including Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Slack (WORK). For example, with Microsoft, Szcaler is integrated into Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender. With Amazon Web Services, the integration of Zscaler improves the security of digital transformation, most significantly for organizations leveraging its cloud infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition\n\nOf Zscaler's competitors, and there are many, a few notable ones stand out to me as being potentially the biggest threats:\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW): I consider it to be the most significant competitor as the company has a wide range of security solutions, including advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings. Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO): The most well-financed peer, the company has an extensive range of security products, such as firewalls, VPNs and advanced malware protection. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT): The company covers everything from firewalls to secure SD-WAN, which manages traffic across wide area networks for higher efficiency.\n\nIt is useful for us to put these four peers into proper perspective based on some of the core financial metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet IPO 2018 2012 1990 2009 Market Cap $29.22 B $92.71 B $201.53 B $52.1 B Equity-to-Asset 0.24 0.24 0.46 -0.06 Net Margin -7.32% 30.24% 23.49% 21.64% 3Y Rev Growth Rate 49.6% 19.8% 6.2% 29.6% FWD PE Ratio 82 56 13.4 40\n\nIt is quite evident to me that Zscaler has particular appeal compared to some of the newer players, namely Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, as it shows higher growth. I believe, as is the case with most excellent companies that last over the long term, it will manage to stabilize its profitability. This is already somewhat evident in that its median net margin over the past 10 years is -26.69%, but, over time, it has reined this in to -7.32%.\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks looks like a compelling alternative investment, Zscaler is more attractive by and large, in my opinion. Palo Alto Networks has a strong acquisition strategy, including CloudGenix in 2020 and Twistlock in 2019, and a diverse product portfolio, including its Prisma cloud and Cortex AI security platform. But Zscaler's portfolio looks stronger and it has also made multiple high-status acquisitions, bolstering its five key areas of operation that act as a simple framework for enterprise partnerships. Among these are:\n\nZscaler Internet Access: Efficient in secure internet and SaaS application access, replacing traditional VPN and firewall technology. Zscaler Private Access: Access to private applications securely, without a VPN, without bringing users onto the internet. Zscaler Cloud Protection: Provides security for public cloud environments. Zscaler Digital Experience: A comprehensive monitoring solution that ensures optimal user experience of Zscaler tools while also optimizing security.\n\nIn short, Zscaler offers a one-point solution with some of the most advanced technology on the market, which I think outperforms Palo Alto Networks, Cisco and Fortinet operationally in many areas, specifically as it relates to cloud security and simplicity in these operations.\n\nMarket drivers\n\nZscaler's growth is hinged on the widely anticipated expansion of the broader digital services market, particularly the managed services market, which includes managed data centers, security, network and infrastructure services. Mordor Intelligence estimates this will grow at a compound annual rate of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029. It attributes factors such as an increasing shift to hybrid IT, improved cost and operational efficiency demand and rising IT complexity as core drivers of this market growth. My own opinion is that the market as it relates to Zscaler will grow faster than this, even more so than Mordor's estimate of an 11.44% CAGR for the cybersecurity market from 2024 to 2029. My own estimate is around a 15% CAGR over the next decade, as my belief is the adoption of cloud services, hybrid and remote working and demand for advanced digital services and associated security will increase exponentially as AI proliferates the mainstream more readily, driving new business models that are more operationally digital due to cost-effectiveness, a higher amount of self-employed and independent contractors and a lower reliance on human labor in general as functions become more reliably automated.\n\nThis is a very interesting time to be in the job market, as I believe we are going to see faster change than we ever have in history, and people will have to be quick to react to shifting labor demands. That being said, one constant seems to ring true, which is that most, if not all, of these labor demands will be significantly dependent on digital workflows and associated data protection and security, which will be highly beneficial for companies like Zscaler.\n\nValuation\n\nSuccessfully valuing Zscaler based on earnings is difficult because of how early on it is in its development. As this is the case, I have opted to analyzes its price-to-free cash flow ratio relative to peers instead. I have also looked at the company's price-to-operating cash flow ratio against peers for the same reason. First of all, consider each of the four peers compared based on the two valuation metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet P/FCF 57 34.5 15 31 P/OCF 44 33 14 28\n\nZscaler is quite clearly the highest valued of the four, but investors should consider that its valuation has come down considerably in the last few years. Its median price-to-free cash flow ratio over the past 10 years is 221.75, indicating a 74.10% discount from the historical valuation. Additionally, its price-to-operating cash flow median over the past 10 years is 132.90, indicating a 66.60% discount from the historical valuation.\n\nConsidering analysts expect, on consensus, an earnings per share without non-recurring items CAGR of 31.17% over the next three years, I believe the present valuation shows a significantly strong price and an attractive entry point despite trading at a premium to the three peers. We must remember that Palo Alto Networks has a much lower forecasted CAGR over the next three years of 17.05%, hence the lower premium in the valuation attributed by the market.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is evidently a risk that Zscaler will be outcompeted by other cybersecurity companies that develop, and it appears that there is not a concentrated monopoly in cybersecurity at this time. As such, there is, in some sense, an arms race toward that monopoly in AI-led cybersecurity, similar to how Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have a duopoly in software and hardware. Zscaler investors should watch the market carefully, as there may come a time in the not-too-distant future when it makes sense to sell the stake for another provider if it becomes clear the balance of power has begun to shift.\n\nAdditionally, along similar lines, as AI becomes more powerful and we reach unprecedented capabilities, it is quite possible the cybersecurity and digital landscapes shift considerably. What is now cutting-edge, the cloud, could in the future become outdated and Zscaler has an enormous task at hand in keeping up to date with the rapid shifts that are likely to happen in the AI and associated cybersecurity industries. The company has a large ecosystem with partners and connections in the industry that provide it with some moat in this regard in terms of operational collaboration and financing capabilities, but investors must be aware of the risk of rapid change.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom my research, I believe Zscaler to be one of the best investments in cybersecurity currently, but the markets are shifting quickly. Nonetheless, I believe now is a prudent time to consider the stock due to the favorable valuation and high growth expected by analysts. My research into market drivers bodes very well for the company's long-term future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Amazon Bets $150 Billion on Data Centers Required for AI Boom",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to spend almost $150 billion in the coming 15 years on data centers, giving the cloud-computing giant the firepower to handle an expected explosion in demand for artificial intelligence applications and other digital services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nLondon Insurers Face Baltimore Bridge Payouts Worth Billions Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Dubai Is Losing Its Allure for Wealthy Russians China Property Crisis Is Rippling Through Its Biggest Banks Japan Amps Up Intervention Threat as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990\n\nThe spending spree is a show of force as the company looks to maintain its grip on the cloud services market, where it holds about twice the share of No. 2 player Microsoft Corp. Sales growth at Amazon Web Services slowed to a record low last year as business customers cut costs and delayed modernization projects. Now spending is starting to pick up again, and Amazon is keen to secure land and electricity for its power-hungry facilities.\n\n“We’re expanding capacity quite significantly,” said Kevin Miller, an AWS vice president who oversees the company’s data centers. “I think that just gives us the ability to get closer to customers.”\n\nOver the past two years, according to a Bloomberg tally, Amazon has committed to spending $148 billion to build and operate data centers around the world. The company plans to expand existing server farm hubs in northern Virginia and Oregon as well as push into new precincts, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.\n\nAmazon’s planned outlay on server farms dwarfs the public commitments from Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, though neither company discloses data center-related spending as consistently as Amazon. Microsoft and Google spokespeople declined to provide comparable figures and added that each company likely includes different costs in their estimates.\n\nAmid broader cost-cutting at Amazon, AWS’s capital expenditures on data centers shrank 2% in 2023—for the first time—even as Microsoft boosted its own spending by more than 50%, according to the research firm Dell’Oro Group. But Amazon’s chief financial officer said last month that capital expenditures would increase this year to support AWS growth, including AI-related projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of Amazon’s data center expansion is geared toward meeting a rise in demand for corporate services like file storage and databases. But the facilities, along with advanced and expensive chips, will also provide the massive computing power required for an expected boom in generative artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft, close partner OpenAI and Google are widely seen as leaders in commercializing software capable of generating text and insights. But Amazon is building its own tools to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers. As a result, Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related revenue.\n\nAWS put its first server farms in Virginia, on the fringes of metropolitan Washington. Home to the first commercial interchange for web traffic, the area remains a crucial hub for video streaming and corporate and government data. Amazon later opened data centers in rural eastern Oregon, taking advantage of cheap hydroelectric power and ample tax breaks. Virginia and Oregon have since received about four of every five dollars AWS spends on US infrastructure.\n\nAmazon plans to spend tens of billions more in those states, but it’s getting harder to secure electricity there. Data centers require lots of power, and their growing ubiquity is putting pressure on utilities. For a few months in 2022, Dominion Energy Inc., which powers Virginia’s data center alley, couldn’t keep up, pausing connections to facilities that were otherwise ready to come online. The utility expects demand to nearly double over the next 15 years, with the growth driven primarily by data centers.\n\nIn Oregon, electricity use by Amazon server farms exceeds the local utility’s share of hydroelectric power, forcing it to buy electricity generated by natural gas, the Oregonian newspaper reported earlier this year.\n\n“There’s a lot more vetting that is occurring upfront and detailed planning that is required from the utility companies to understand how real the project is because there’s so much demand out there that was not there five years ago,” said Ali Greenwood, an executive director at the data center practice of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nSo Amazon is getting creative.\n\nIn February, the company said it would spend about $10 billion on two data center campuses in Mississippi. Billed as the largest corporate project in state history, AWS’s effort will plant roots in the southern US, a region that has seen comparatively little data center spending outside of major cities like Dallas and Atlanta.\n\nEarlier this month, the operator of a 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania said AWS had agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to the facility.\n\nIn Round Rock, Texas, AWS recently won zoning approval to build a data center and electrical substation next to a delivery depot on a slice of a former ranch the company acquired during a pandemic-era spending spree. If the project proceeds, it will be the first time the company has put such facilities on the same piece of land.\n\n“Right now it’s just a mad scramble for any place that has power any time soon,” said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager and Seattle-based investor who tracks cloud company spending.\n\nEven as it ramps up, Amazon and other companies are encountering growing opposition to data centers. Much of the current animus is centered in Virginia, where residents complain about server farms’ incessant hum and preservationists lament the sprawling facilities’ encroachment on Civil War battlefield sites. But pockets of resistance are popping up in other parts of the US and could grow as more and more data centers come online—whether they are built by Amazon or not.\n\nRenewable energy advocates also say the rush to build new facilities has given new life to old plants powered by planet-warming fossil fuels, and even helped make the case to build new ones. In Mississippi, for example, Amazon will pay to help the local utility to build solar farms, but the company will also operate the data centers with a new natural-gas power plant that will probably operate for decades.\n\n“Companies like Amazon are going to have to use their buying power to actually force the utilities to change their behavior,” said Daniel Tait, research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog that backs renewables. “Not only are they inducing more fossil fuel use, but they are creating the precedent that everybody who comes after them will do the same.”\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has been the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, part of a pledge to power all of its operations with renewable electricity by 2025. But those projects can be far from its data centers, a mismatch between supply and demand that bedevils the fractured and aging US power grid.\n\nAmazon data center chief Miller said the company was continuing to evaluate clean energy projects beyond wind and solar farms, including battery storage and nuclear power, that can substitute for fossil fuel plants. He pledged to work with utilities and find a way to “match our need for energy with renewable, carbon-free power.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving AI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Tesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Brilliant \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "OK, I know what you're thinking.\n\nForget Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)? The company is the undisputed leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock since early last year. Furthermore, Nvidia generated triple-digit year-over-year growth for three successive quarters and is forecasting another one for the current quarter. I've been bullish on Nvidia for a long time.\n\nYou're absolutely right on every one of those counts. And no, I haven't changed my mind. I'm still as bullish on Nvidia as ever. Here's the thing: The stock is selling for 80 times earnings and 39 times sales, and despite its growth trajectory, some investors won't even consider a stock with a valuation of that magnitude, even if the forward multiples of 38 times earnings and 18 times sales are more favorable.\n\nFor investors who have absolutely no intention of buying Nvidia at this level, I offer two alternatives from among the other six stocks in the Magnificent Seven: of Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla.\n\nThese stocks still have significant upside but with more reasonable valuations. Furthermore, while Wall Street loves Nvidia, they love Amazon and Microsoft even more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven Buy No. 1: Amazon\n\nIt's easy to see why Wall Street has a soft spot for Amazon. The company revolutionized digital retail, turning a humble online bookstore into an e-commerce juggernaut. Amazon controlled roughly 38% of the e-commerce market last year, according to online data provider Statista. For context, that's more than the next 14 digital retailers combined. The improving economy will no doubt boost its fortunes over the coming year and beyond.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the undisputed leader in the cloud infrastructure space it pioneered, with 31% of the market, according to market analyst Canalys. In response to the accelerating demand for generative AI, Amazon beefed up its cloud offerings, providing the company with a compelling opportunity for future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet's not forget Amazon's digital advertising business. The company was already the third largest online advertiser, behind just Google and Meta Platforms -- and that was before Amazon added advertisements to its Prime Video that will surely boost its revenue.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to find that, of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon is the hands-down favorite among Wall Street analysts, not Nvidia. Of the 47 analysts who cover Amazon, 91% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommends selling. Only 55% rate Nvidia stock a buy, with the rest moving to hold or sell based on valuation concerns.\n\nWhen it comes to Amazon, Mizuho analyst James Lee is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has a buy rating and $230 price target on the stock, which suggests roughly 30% upside. The analyst cites improving revenue for AWS and operating efficiency gains for Amazon's e-commerce business as fueling his positive take.\n\nGiven the multiple drivers for future growth, it's easy to see why Amazon is a favorite among Wall Street analysts. Furthermore, at less than 3 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a bargain.\n\nMagnificent Seven Buy No. 2: Microsoft\n\nIt's not difficult to see the appeal of Microsoft. It's best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system and its leading suite of business productivity software, Office, which provides the company with a strong foundation upon which to build its future.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is the No. 2 Cloud provider, with 26% of the market, and growth recently accelerated to 30% year over year in the most recent quarter, outpacing AWS and Google Cloud at 13% and 26%, respectively. Helping fuel those market share gains was the company's quick move into generative AI and its suite of AI-fueled digital assistants dubbed Copilot.\n\nThese moves increased demand for Azure. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, the company noted that 6 percentage points of its cloud growth was the result of growing demand for AI services.\n\nMicrosoft is also more highly rated on Wall Street than Nvidia. Of the 34 analysts who offered opinions in March, 79% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, also well ahead of the GPU specialist.\n\nAnalysts at Truist are Microsoft's biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street. They have a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $600, which represents 42% upside for investors. The analysts cite Microsoft's early implementation of generative AI and see additional demand for Azure and Copilot as driving future growth.\n\nMicrosoft's early moves in AI and strong legacy businesses help illustrate why the stock is preferred on Wall Street. Furthermore, at less than 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling at a slight premium to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its robust growth and future prospects, Microsoft is deserving of its premium -- and it's still cheaper than Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The inflation panic took the wind out of Wall Street's sails, especially where it crosses Silicon Valley in a proverbial sense. The stocks of tech titans Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) took a beating as investors backed away from growth-oriented ideas.\n\nAmazon's shares fell as much as 57% from its pre-panic record price. The Google parent's price drop stopped at 46%. Only now, more than two years later, are they sniffing at fresh all-time highs again.\n\nI don't think this is the last hurrah from two tired comeback stories. Instead, I see Alphabet and Amazon as the two best buys in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group right now, with tremendous returns on the long-term horizon. You should consider grabbing some of these top-quality stocks while they're still relatively affordable.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet's big AI bets\n\nFirst, I'd like to point out that Amazon and Alphabet have plenty of irons in the artificial intelligence (AI) fires. They may not be as deeply and directly involved in the frenzy for generative AI and large language models (LLMs) as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), but you're looking at two of the leading providers of cloud-based computing services.\n\nGoogle Cloud and Amazon Web Services play significant roles in the back-end of everyone else's AI ambitions, crunching the required numbers in their global data center networks. They also offer their own AI tools, led by the ChatGPT-like Google Gemini platform and the Amazon Lex chatbot. You may not be familiar with Lex, but it's basically the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa, made available for any developer in need of a conversationsl natural language system. How committed to AI innovation are Google and Amazon? Well, both companies use the latest and greatest AI acceleration hardware from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), but that's not all. The Cloud TPU and AWS Inferentia chips are proprietary AI accelerator chips designed by Google's and Amazon's own engineers, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd they are heavy users of AI tools in their daily work, too. You'll find AI behind the scenes of many consumer-facing services, from travel routes in Google Maps and Amazon's automated warehouse management to YouTube's video recommendation engine and Alexa's helpful chatter.\n\nThese stocks aren't expensive, even at all-time highs\n\nSo I'm not saying that Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks should have tripled over the last year, like Nvidia. But their rebound from the rock-bottom pricing of the inflation crisis was slower than they deserved. I can't believe it took this long just to get back to prices last seen in November 2021.\n\nAnd they're priced to keep on moving, too.\n\nShares of Amazon are changing hands at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.2 times sales. Alphabet's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) clocks in at 6.1. In a world where Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) commands a double-digit P/S ratio and Nvidia has soared to 39 times sales, these figures strike me as big market-maker mistakes.\n\nWhy Amazon and Alphabet aren't skyrocketing (yet)\n\nOf course, Wall Street had its reasons to keep Alphabet and Amazon under wraps while most of their \"Magnificent Seven\" peers soared.\n\nThe digital advertising market fell into a deep recession in 2022. Inflationary pressure is no joke -- consumers held on to their wallets with both hands while everybody's cost of doing business rose. That's not a great environment for launching extravagant marketing campaigns. The economic pressure has subsided in recent quarters but I'm still not talking about a full-fledged return to optimal health. So Alphabet's ad-based business has seen slower growth than usual, and the stock arguably deserves a bit of a discount under these circumstances.\n\nThe same market reality also held back Amazon's retail sales. The inflation crunch started knee-deep in the all-important holiday season of 2021. The e-commerce veteran had to cut costs, slow down its spending on the delivery infrastructure, and absorb two years of low-grade growth. Again, I see why risk-averse investors would stay away from Amazon against that backdrop.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet should soar soon enough\n\nAmazon and Alphabet, with their undaunted investments in AI and cloud computing, are not just surviving the storm but blazing their own paths through it.\n\nThe key takeaway? Investors should try to tune out the market noise and focus on the fundamentals. These tech giants look undervalued today, but that doesn't mean you should consider selling your shares to find better alternatives. On the contrary, the modest pricing is an open invitation to grab fistfuls of Alphabet and Amazon shares at a reasonable price.\n\nIn the end, no downturn lasts forever. This pair of \"Magnificent Seven\" beasts is prepared to truly soar when the American and global economy gets back on its feet.\n\nThe companies that drive tomorrow's innovations will deliver the most enduring returns. That's what Amazon and Alphabet do, and I can't wait to see how they will fare in the current bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 States with the Largest Homeless Populations Per Capita.\n\nThe Homelessness Crisis in the US\n\nThe United States faces a significant challenge with homelessness, with the number of homeless individuals surging to record levels. The homeless population in the US is steadily rising, largely due to rising housing costs and a shortage of affordable housing.\n\nOn March 22, Reuters reported that state and local governments in the US are pursuing different strategies to tackle the country’s homelessness crisis. Some are aiming to raise more funds to address the issue, while others are empowering authorities to rid public places of its visible signs. In California, a ballot measure emphasizing funding for homeless services was narrowly passed by voters. Meanwhile, in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis took a different approach by signing legislation that prohibits camping on city sidewalks, parks, and other public areas. Similarly, Kentucky's legislature has moved forward with an anti-crime bill that includes a similar camping ban while also expanding citizens' \"stand your ground\" rights against trespassers. According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the homeless population in the US increased by 12% year-over-year to reach a record high of 653,000 in 2023. To achieve a permanent solution to homelessness, experts and advocates emphasize the critical role of increasing the availability of affordable housing options.\n\nCorporate Efforts to Combat the Homelessness Crisis\n\nThe nationwide efforts underscore the escalating severity of the homelessness crisis. The sight of people living in tents on sidewalks is becoming increasingly common in many US cities and towns, pushing politicians and policymakers to take action. Additionally, major corporations have pledged to contribute towards resolving the housing crisis and promoting affordable housing solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the biggest corporations that have stepped up include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google. These three giant tech corporations are actively engaged in combating homelessness in the US by contributing funds and resources to address this pressing issue. You can also read about the largest companies in the world by market cap in 2024.\n\nIn 2019, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google announced a $1 billion initiative focused on enhancing affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, aiming to facilitate the construction of a minimum of 20,000 homes catering to various income levels across the region. The tech giant's strategy involves repurposing its land for housing projects targeting middle and low-income families. Furthermore, Google established a $250 million affordable housing investment fund to expedite the development and preservation of affordable housing units in the Bay Area. By providing early and reliable investment capital, Google seeks to accelerate the creation of a substantial amount of housing in a timely and sustainable manner. As of June 2023, Google has allocated $133 million toward the development of affordable housing projects throughout the Bay Area. Additionally, Google has invested in Factory_OS, a modular housing company, to expand its production capacity by constructing a second factory, with the aim of generating tens of thousands of homes over the next decade. This investment has already supported Factory_OS in delivering over 2,000 modular homes.\n\nIn January 2019, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also announced its Affordable Housing Initiative which currently stands at $750 million. This initiative aims to promote affordable housing solutions in the Puget Sound region through strategic loans and grants. The company continues to engage with local authorities, housing developers, and financial agencies to identify the best opportunities to construct more affordable housing in the region. As of 2022, three years after the launch of its Affordable Housing Initiative, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported that it has directed $583 million towards preserving and constructing around 9,200 housing units in the Puget Sound region, which includes projects amounting to $73 million in affordable housing investments and grants.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks high among the companies with the most employees in the US. In January 2021, Amazon launched its $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create more than 20,000 affordable homes. This initiative aims to assist individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in three key areas where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates: the Puget Sound region in Washington State, Arlington in Virginia, and Nashville in Tennessee. Additionally, Amazon has allocated $100 million in cash and donations to Mary’s Place, a nonprofit partner, to construct the largest family shelter in Washington state within an Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) office building at the Puget Sound headquarters.\n\nNow that we have looked at corporate actions against the housing crisis in the US, let’s shift our focus to the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita. 20 States with the Largest Homeless Populations Per Capita\n\nCopyright: zhukovsky / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article, we have listed the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita. To calculate the homeless rate by state per capita, we first consulted The 2023 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) by The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. We used the latest data available in their dataset, which provided us with estimates of people experiencing homelessness at the state level as of December 2023.\n\nWe then consulted the United States Census Bureau. This database provided us with estimated populations of US states as of July 2023. We used the data available to calculate the homeless population per capita in each state. Finally, we narrowed down our selection to rank the 20 states with the largest homeless populations per capita, which are listed below in ascending order.\n\nPlease note that we have truncated per capita values after 6 decimal places for better representation.\n\n20 States with the Largest Homeless Populations Per Capita\n\n20.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN has expanded its same-day medication delivery service to New York City and Los Angeles in a bid to bolster its online pharmacy retail business, Amazon Pharmacy.\r\n\r\nWith this move, patients suffering from flu, high blood pressure, diabetes or any other common conditions located in NYC and the greater Los Angeles area will now be able to receive their prescribed medicines within a few hours.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, Amazon Pharmacy is using new small-format facilities stocked with common medicines to boost the delivery speed.\r\n\r\nReportedly, AMZN has made plans to deploy a pharmacist and a fulfillment team somewhere in Brooklyn to boost the delivery speed.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is looking forward to leveraging generative AI and machine learning technologies in the series of fact-checking tasks in order to speed up the fulfillment process.\r\n\r\nAmazon intends to expand the same-day delivery of prescription medication to over a dozen cities in the United States by the end of this year. The service is currently available in Austin, TX; Indianapolis, IN; Miami; Phoenix, AZ and Seattle, WA.\r\n\r\nThe company’s deepening focus on the expansion of the underlined service will enable Amazon Pharmacy to boost its reach to patients, which, in turn, will benefit its online retail business, the key growth driver for Amazon.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 17.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9.7%.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Pharma Retail Efforts\n\nPer a report from Statista, the online pharmacy market is expected to generate revenues of $52.51 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to hit $81.37 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2024 and 2028.\r\n\r\nAmazon remains well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects present in this market on the back of Amazon Pharmacy, which allows customers to place their medicine orders with the help of a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Moreover, the company’s growing online pharma retail efforts remain noteworthy.\r\n\r\nApart from the latest move, Amazon recently teamed up with Eli Lilly LLY. Per the terms, Lilly selected Amazon Pharmacy for the home delivery of drug prescriptions that are sent to its direct-to-consumer service, LillyDirect. This service is limited to certain drugs, which include medications for diabetes, obesity and migraine.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the company’s introduction of RxPass, a Prime membership benefit, is another plus. It enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible medications for one flat monthly fee of $5 and get them delivered for free.\r\n\r\nThe company also launched the drone delivery of medicines from Amazon Pharmacy, which is a major positive. Amazon Pharmacy promises to drop a package within 60 minutes of order placement.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned efforts will not only aid the company’s online store sales but also will drive growth in its subscription revenues, thanks to pharmacy related Prime perks. This, in turn, will likely drive Amazon’s overall top-line growth.\r\n\r\nFor first-quarter 2024, Amazon expects net sales between $138 billion and $143.5 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 8-13% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $142.42 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the retail-wholesale sector are eBay EBAY and The Kroger Co.

        "content": "(Adds Amazon, judge comment, details)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee and Inti Landauro\n\nBRUSSELS, March 27 (Reuters) - Amazon on Wednesday lost its fight to suspend a requirement regarding its online advertising under EU tech rules after Europe's top court backed EU regulators, saying EU interests outweigh the U.S. online retailer's material interests.\n\nUnder the Digital Services Act (DSA) which kicked in last year, Amazon was designated as a very large online platform subject to tough rules to tackle illegal and harmful content on its platform.\n\nThe company subsequently challenged a DSA requirement to make publicly available a repository containing detailed information on its online advertising and also asked for an interim measure until the court rules on the case.\n\nA lower tribunal in September agreed to its request for an interim measure to suspend the contested obligation, which prompted the European Commission to turn to Europe's top court.\n\nThe Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) set aside the suspension order and dismissed Aamzon's application for an interim measure.\n\nThe judge said that Amazon's argument that the obligation unlawfully limits its fundamental rights to respect for private life and the freedom to conduct a business was not irrelevant.\n\nHe also said that without a suspension, it was likely that Amazon would suffer serious and irreparable harm before any judgment annulling the Commission's decision.\n\nHowever, he said a suspension could have a detrimental impact on the objectives of the DSA.\n\n\"Suspension would lead to a delay, potentially for several years, in the full achievement of the objectives of the Regulation on a Single Market for Digital Services and therefore potentially allow an online environment threatening fundamental rights to persist or develop,\" the judge said.\n\n\"The interests defended by the EU legislature prevail, in the present case, over Amazon's material interests, with the result that the balancing of interests weighs in favour of rejecting the request for suspension.\"\n\nAmazon said: \"We are disappointed with this decision, and maintain that Amazon doesn't fit the description of a 'Very Large Online Platform' (VLOP) under the DSA, and should not be designated as such.\"\n\nThe case is C-639/23 P(R) | Commission v Amazon Services Europe.

        "content": "Brown Capital Management, an investment management company, released its “The Brown Capital Management Mid Company Fund” fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The Mid Company Fund returns of 14.08% in the quarter slightly lagged the 14.55% return for the Russell Midcap Growth Index. The fund declined 27.14% for the full year compared to a 25.87% return for the benchmark. In addition, check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nBrown Capital Management Mid Company Fund featured stocks like Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) provides a cloud-based commerce platform. On March 26, 2024, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stock closed at $78.53 per share. One-month return of Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) was 3.93%, and its shares gained 68.16% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) has a market capitalization of $101.083 billion.\n\nBrown Capital Management Mid Company Fund stated the following regarding Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Among the top contributors for the fourth quarter were Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) and Manhattan Associates (MANH). Shopify is the second-largest cloud-based e-commerce software platform in the U.S., with 10% market share. Shopify provides upstarts and Fortune 500 companies alike with turnkey solutions to help individuals and businesses run their online stores. The range of services includes web design, inventory management, payment processing, analytics and reporting, among others. We believe the company is the most attractive alternative to Amazon and has an addressable market greater than $150 billion.\n\nShopify released stellar results this quarter, growing revenue 25% with meaningful margin expansion and management indicating more to come. Notably, the third quarter was Shopify’s first full quarter after deciding in May 2023 to abandon its in-house fulfillment and logistics ambitions which put significant pressure on margins. Additionally, competitive concerns from Amazon’s “Buy With Prime” initiative that launched in April 2022 also abated. The feature allows merchants selling outside of Amazon to access its fulfillment network and enjoy Prime benefits such as free deliveries and returns, posing a threat to Shopify’s payment-processing revenue. Instead of duking it out, Shopify and Amazon reached a partnership agreement in September that preserves customer choice and, to our knowledge, keeps Shopify’s payment revenues intact. With these key concerns in the rear-view mirror, Shopify should have a clear path to double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion for years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA woman in fashionable apparel shopping on an e-commerce platform.\n\nShopify Inc.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March",
        "content": "If you've followed the technology sector even the slightest bit over the past year or so, you've noticed the mania for artificial intelligence (AI). It's almost unavoidable at this point.\n\nAlthough recent AI developments pushed it into the mainstream, the technology existed for decades. That said, we're still in the early stages of learning what the technology can truly become, which gives investors a chance to get in on the emerging industry. For investors interested in adding AI-related stocks to their portfolios, the following three companies are great options.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nThere's a strong argument that OpenAI's ChatGPT is the reason that AI has hit the mainstream. After it was released to the public in November 2022, it took just two months or so for ChatGPT to hit 100 million monthly active users. And aside from OpenAI, there was probably no company happier about this than Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have an ongoing partnership that has put Microsoft at the forefront of AI-driven computing capabilities. It began with Microsoft making an initial $1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 and has since developed into a full collaboration (and an expanded investment) that mutually benefits both companies.\n\nOpenAI gets to use Microsoft's Azure as its cloud computing platform -- which is vital because of the supercomputing power it provides -- and Microsoft gets exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models, which allow it to integrate them into its products and services and boost its competitive advantage.\n\nMicrosoft's diverse suite of products and services distinguishes it from other tech companies, and adding OpenAI's advanced technologies will only enhance this. It should also positively affect Microsoft's financial results, which have been on an impressive run over the past five years. MSFT Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) may not seem like an obvious AI stock, but it's as crucial to the AI pipeline as arguably any other company.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo understand TSMC's role in AI, you need to understand how we get to end consumer-facing products like ChatGPT, Bard, and other generative AI applications. For AI to be effective, it must be trained using lots of data -- quantities that must be stored in specialized data centers.\n\nData centers rely on graphic processing units (GPUs), which are essentially the brains of AI computing systems. TSMC and the semiconductors it manufactures for its client companies are crucial in this process. These GPUs rely heavily on TSMC's best-in-class manufacturing processes.\n\nThis AI domino effect hasn't impacted TSMC's financials yet, but the company's CEO said he expects sales of its AI-related semiconductors to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% for at least the next few years. By 2027, AI-related semiconductors are expected to be responsible for a percentage of the company's revenue in the high teens.\n\nTSMC is one of the more important players in bringing AI to life, and its role in that ecosystem can't be easily replicated.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) relied on AI for a while to supplement its e-commerce business. Its AI systems analyze customers' purchase and search histories, behavior (such as time spent on pages and navigation across pages), and other data to provide personalized shopping recommendations that improve the shopping experience and, ideally, increase its sales.\n\nAI long bolstered Amazon's e-commerce business, but recent developments have exposed other parts of the company's business to it, such as its market-leading cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS is the world's leading cloud computing platform, and it consistently adds AI and machine learning tools that allow users and companies to build their own AI applications. Although e-commerce is Amazon's bread and butter, AWS is its primary profit center and will continue to be for quite some time, particularly as it continues to expand its suite of AI products.\n\nAmazon has been investing heavily in its AI capabilities, and it's hard to imagine it will stop soon -- especially because the company's free cash flow has returned to typical levels, giving it the financial flexibility to accelerate its AI research and development. AMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAmazon is a company that has its hand in a lot of different industries, many of which it acts as the leader. As its AI capabilities continue to evolve, it's a company investors will want to be a part of for the long haul.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "WARSAW, March 27 (Reuters) - Amazon has been fined 31 million zlotys ($7.8 million) in Poland for misleading customers about product availability and delivery dates, consumer watchdog UOKiK said on Wednesday.\n\nThe regulator said it had received complaints from customers who did not receive their orders.\n\n\"The average consumer has the right to assume that the purchase options, availability and delivery times offered by traders are not misleading,\" UOKiK head Tomasz Chrostny said in a statement.\n\nChrostny said that UOKiK had questioned practices such as displaying a time counter on the screen indicating a period in which the order should be placed without a guarantee that it will arrive within the timeframe given.\n\nAmazon's press office said the company would appeal against the decision.\n\n\"While the vast majority of our deliveries arrive on time, customers can contact us in the rare event that they experience a delay or order cancellation, and we will make it right,\" it said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Over the last year, we have collaborated with ...

        "title": "'Apple will prevail': US faces uphill slog in new antitrust battle",
        "content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland made a bold statement last week when he announced a new antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL): \"The United States normally wins the cases that it brings.\"\n\nBut not all legal experts agree federal prosecutors hold the upper hand in a legal battle that aims to dismantle the architecture of Apple’s marquee product, the iPhone.\n\n\"My guess is [Apple] will win,\" University of Chicago law professor Randy Picker told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEven if Apple does not prevail in New Jersey federal court where the case was filed, Picker expects the tech giant to succeed on appeals, possibly to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Yes I think that Apple will prevail in the end.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland, announcing the government's antitrust suit against Apple. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest of several confrontations between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\n\nThe Justice Department is also suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) — alleging they also violate antitrust laws.\n\nThe case against Apple is the widest ranging of these tech antitrust suits. The Justice Department alleges that the maker of the iPhone illegally maintains its dominance over the smartphone market by boxing out competing apps and devices.\n\nThe tech giant last week called the suit a threat to the very principles that set the company apart from its rivals and characterized the government’s legal theory as a dubious one with legal claims that were wrong on the facts and the law.\n\nIn broad terms, the government alleges Apple must open up the iPhone operating system so that it becomes easier for non-Apple businesses to add and run their own products — including digital wallets, smartwatches, messaging apps, super apps, and cloud streaming apps — on the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook In China last Sunday. (Wu Hao/Pool Photo via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple said forcing it to open up the iPhone’s ecosystem would ultimately harm consumers by hampering its ability to design \"the kind of technology people expect from Apple – where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral to that design, the company said, are privacy, security and safety features that give users high levels of personal and financial data protection.\n\nHarvard Kennedy School adjunct cybersecurity policy lecturer Bruce Schneiner said that if Apple does a good job of making the security argument \"I think they win.\"\n\nBut there is a potential weakness to that argument. The iPhone's security protection, he said, is attributable to the company’s business model and not to the phone's design.\n\n\"Apple does have more security, because they don't spy on people for a living,\" Schneiner said. \"They make the money on devices and electronics.\"\n\nWhat's more, the iPhone and a rival smartphone like Google's Pixel offer similar security features, according to Schneiner.\n\n\"Don’t be confused in thinking that security is an end in itself. It furthers the goal of profits.\"\n\nThe hurdles DOJ must overcome\n\nSome argue the government has a strong case.\n\n\"I think it’s very well pleaded,\" said New York University School of Law professor Eleanor Fox, who pointed out that the DOJ claims to have evidence of Apple’s deliberate steps to block competition and cut out options for consumers.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the government has some challenges to overcome.\n\nOne is that judges are typically restrained from ordering companies to change the way they run their business, according to Boston College of Law antitrust professor David Olsen.\n\nTo overcome those limits, Olsen said, the government is alleging that the iPhone falls into a category of products so essential to life that they get special treatment under antitrust law. Apple has a dominant share of the US smartphone market. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/file photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nUnless the government proves the iPhone is an \"essential facility,\" Olsen explained, Apple has autonomy to make their products how they want.\n\nAnother challenge for the US government is that it must adequately identify Apple as a monopolist in a particular market.\n\nThe market of choice in this case is the smartphone market; Apple holds roughly 70% of the US smartphone market and 20% of the global market.\n\nThen it must address a critical question: \"What have you done with your monopoly that’s problematic?” Picker said.\n\nThe government’s answer is that Apple’s design of the iPhone is illegal because it works most optimally with its own apps and products – like iWatch, iMessage, Wallet, and the App Store. That, in turn, makes it difficult for customers to switch to a non-Apple device.\n\nA 'pretty hard case'\n\nOne potential advantage for Apple is that it has successfully argued in other court cases that it maintains tight control over its ecosystem to protect consumers rather than to harm them.\n\nIn fact, the arguments Apple surfaced last week echoed those it made in a private antitrust case brought in 2020 by the developer of the mega popular gaming app “Fortnite,” Epic Games. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. (Photo by Philip Pacheco/Getty Images) (Philip Pacheco via Getty Images)\n\nIt was a case that Apple mostly won.\n\nA federal district court judge in California and a three-judge appellate court panel in San Francisco ruled that Epic failed to show Apple held a monopoly in either of the disputed markets at issue: the mobile-game transactions market or the markets for iOS app distribution and in-app payment solutions.\n\nThe Justice Department has made some compelling claims in its new suit against Apple, Olsen said, but he doubts that under scrutiny they will hold up as antitrust law violations.\n\n\"It gives us a litany of practices that DOJ argues make consumers and developers worse off,\" Olsen said, but the harder question is whether those practices are merely a list of what Apple could do to make things better for developers or customers.\n\n\"It's usually a pretty hard case to say that someone has to, because of antitrust law, change the way they are running their company.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Chinese TikTok sellers complain of under-fire platform tightening US rule enforcement",
        "content": "By David Kirton\n\nSHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce vendors that want to sell products on TikTok Shop in the U.S. as an alternative to Amazon are upset by moves they say the short video app has made to tighten enforcement of its rules for overseas sellers opening shops on the platform.\n\nChinese-owned TikTok, which faces the threat of having to divest its U.S. operations or be banned, has in recent weeks taken a harder stance toward enforcing its internal rules, according to five Chinese vendors on the site and an industry association that represents 3,000 Chinese stores selling products online.\n\nTikTok is requiring that U.S. entities registered by sellers be 51% U.S. owned and chaired by an U.S. passport holder, said the vendors and Winnie Wang, executive chairman of the Shenzhen Cross Border E-Commerce Association, China's largest sellers group based in the manufacturing hub.\n\nMany Chinese sellers had used U.S. entities to be recognised as U.S. merchants on the platform but the rules mean they will need to be re-registered as overseas sellers, which they say receive less prominence and support, putting them at a disadvantage compared to U.S. TikTok sellers.\n\nTikTok, used by about 170 million Americans, has been seeking to strike the right balance between pursuing rapid growth and managing regulatory risks.\n\nIt has been ramping up its rhetoric that a U.S. move to ban the platform would take billions of dollars out of the pockets of creators and small businesses, while simultaneously seeking to catch up to bigger rivals such as Shein and PDD Holdings-owned Temu by signing up more merchants.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the company has clear policies and requirements for all sellers on its shop, including for international sellers, and these have not changed since TikTok Shop was introduced in the U.S. in September 2023.\n\n\"TikTok maintains robust policies to protect customers and promote a trustworthy shopping environment, and we continually strengthen how we enforce our rules,\" the spokesperson said, without commenting specifically on whether international sellers get less prominence.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Chinese vendors said they feel targeted by TikTok's rules and some are thinking about reducing the resources they put into pushing sales on the platform or finding U.S. partners.\n\n\"We're rethinking how much of our time and resources we put into this,\" said Shenzhen-based e-commerce seller Jackie Bai.\n\nHe and another seller said that in comparison, Amazon does not differentiate between U.S. and other sellers on its platform, with all having access to its \"seller central\" and competing equally.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBai and two other China-based sellers said they heard from TikTok Shop representatives that the tightening of the rules was in response to the political sensitivities TikTok faces in the U.S. in an election year. TikTok declined to comment.\n\nU.S. officials have criticised the app's security and privacy, suggesting user data might be shared with Beijing, but TikTok has said the firm has never shared, or received a request to share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government.\n\nAMAZON ALTERNATIVE\n\nChinese vendors selling products from beauty to clothing to housewares have rapidly grown their presence on ByteDance-owned TikTok's shopping platform in the months since its U.S. launch.\n\n\"Almost every single consumer tech company I know based in China, and every Chinese consumer tech client we serve, is selling on TikTok, and those who are not selling are considering how and when to begin selling on TikTok,\" said Chris Pereira, CEO of business consulting group Impact.\n\nTikTok's U.S. shop posted a gross merchandise value of $1.67 billion from its opening in September 2023 to the year's end, according to an estimate from data provider YipitData.\n\nTikTok said it does not disclose sales and did not reply to queries about the accuracy of YipitData's estimates.\n\nSellers said they had sought an alternative channel to the dominant e-commerce giant Amazon and were also drawn by subsidies on delivery costs.\n\nSome 50% of sellers on the Amazon marketplace are Chinese, with most concentrated in Shenzhen, said Wang.\n\nThese vendors, typically small businesses, submit applications to create \"digital storefronts\" and pay fees to the platforms for servicing their accounts and for advertising and delivering their products.\n\nBai opened a U.S. TikTok shop largely selling undergarments in October and the platform was already generating 20% of his revenues by the end of February, he said.\n\nHe did not want to name his business or products citing fear of retaliation from the platform, but said his TikTok store had thrived after he hired U.S. actors to promote his products.\n\nBai said that a TikTok sales representative told him this month he would have to close his U.S.-based entity and re-register as an overseas seller because he is a Chinese citizen.\n\nBai is now reconsidering his strategy and is looking for local partners as he believes this would disadvantage him against rival sellers.\n\n\"TikTok's shop is so new, the internal rules are changing every week, and these are particularly strict,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by David Kirton in Shenzhen; Additional reporting by Casey Hall in Shanghai; Editing by Brenda Goh and Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 richest billionaires who inherited their fortunes. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires Who Inherited their Fortunes.\n\nBillionaires Heirs on the Rise\n\nAccording to the UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report 2023, it has happened for the first time in nine editions of the report that billionaires have gathered more wealth through inheritance than entrepreneurship as the ‘great wealth transfer’ has started to pick pace. In the next 20 years, more than 1,000 billionaires will pass an estimated $5.2 trillion of their wealth to their children, as per the UBS report. The surge in billionaires passing their wealth to their children is driven by higher entrepreneurial activity over the last few decades. In 2022, around 53 heirs inherited a total wealth of $150.8 billion, surpassing the total wealth of $140.7 billion accumulated by 84 new self-made billionaires.\n\nAs we mentioned in our article about the 20 richest people in Africa in 2024, the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region gained the most wealth, with the region’s wealth rising by 21% to $3.2 trillion in the 2022/2023 period. The total number of billionaires in the EMEA region increased from 599 in 2022 to 658 in 2023. In the last 12 months, the number of billionaires around the world have increased from 2,376 to 2,544, rising by 7% through April 6, 2023.\n\nAs the great wealth passes on, the newer generations have their own view on the legacy of the business and utilization of their wealth. Around 63% of billionaires with inherited wealth who were surveyed said that they plan to continue and expand their family business. Almost 60% of heirs expressed that they want to support future generations and 32% plan to continue donating their wealth as per pre-defined philanthropic goals. As per Forbes, the leading 400 billionaires in 2023 collectively gave away nearly $250 billion to charity, accounting for less than 6% of their combined net worth.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday’s heirs are more focused on major economic opportunities such as impact investing, innovative technologies, and clean-energy transformation. Around 58% of first-generation billionaires believe that their biggest challenge to take over from their heirs will be inculcating the necessary values, education, and experience. Heirs are also cautious about the global economic threats with 66% of first-generation billionaires seeing a potential US recession as their primary concern. Moreover, 62% of first-generation billionaire heirs see geopolitical tensions as the greatest economic challenge. With the advancement in technology, 65% of heirs feel generative artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the biggest commercial opportunities for operating their business in 2024.\n\nIn relation to investing, 43% of first-generation billionaires plan to increase their allocation to private debt in 2024 and 38% intend to raise developed market bond holdings. Around 63% and 44% of billionaires in the Americas are seeking exposure to private equity direct investments and private equity funds, respectively.\n\nCompanies Driving Generational Wealth\n\nSome of the richest billionaires who inherited their fortunes continue to experience an increase in their wealth through the progress of their companies. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Reliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE), and L'Oreal S.A. (EPA:OR) are some of the biggest companies in the world owned and operated by the richest billionaire heirs.\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of America’s largest retail corporations. The Walton family holds an estimated 45% stake in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), distributed among the seven heirs of founder Sam Walton and his brother Bud, as per Forbes. The company is ranked number 1 for the 10th consecutive year on the Fortune Global 500 list. On February 20, the company announced its fourth-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2024. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported earnings per share of $0.60, beating consensus estimates by $0.05. The company posted revenue of approximately $171.91 billion, surpassing estimates by $2.66 billion. Here are some of the comments from the Q4 2024 earnings call:\n\n“Our team delivered a great quarter, finishing off a strong year. We drove sales growth of 4.9% and adjusted operating profit growth of 10.9% in constant currency. Highlights include: higher transaction counts and unit volumes; gains in market share in the U.S. and internationally; improved in-stock levels with inventory being in great shape and down versus last year; strong performance in Walmart U.S. customer experience scores, even during the high volume days before Christmas. Plus, this year, we passed $100 billion in global e-commerce sales for the first time.”\n\nReliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) was founded by Dhirubhai Ambani. The heir to the company Mukesh Ambani is the world’s 11th richest person, as of March 25. On January 29, Reliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) reported its consolidated results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported gross revenue of $29.8 billion, up by 3.2% year-over-year. The EBITDA came in at $5.4 billion, rising by 16.7% year-over-year.\n\nL'Oreal S.A. (EPA:OR) was founded by Eugène Schueller and the wealth was transferred to the family. Schueller’s granddaughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, heiress to the company’s wealth is the vice-chairwoman of L'Oreal S.A. (EPA:OR). Bettencourt Meyers and her family own around 33% of L'Oreal S.A. (EPA:OR) shares, as per Forbes. On February 9, L'Oreal S.A. (EPA:OR) announced that it signed a long-term agreement with Prada S.p.A. (OTC:PRDSY) to create, develop, and distribute luxury beauty products for the Miu Miu brand.\n\nWith this context, let’s take a look at the 25 richest billionaires who inherited their fortunes.  25 Richest Billionaires Who Inherited Their Fortunes\n\nA businessman in a suit, counting stacks of money in front of a graph of a mortgage finance market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe gathered the data for the 25 richest billionaires who inherited their fortunes from the Forbes Real Time Billionaires Index.

        "title": "Why serial entrepreneur Marc Lore is pouring $100 million of his own money into a food delivery business",
        "content": "Marc Lore is hoping a new cash infusion will add some wonder to his vision for food delivery.\n\nThe longtime entrepreneur is fresh from raising $700 million to fund growth initiatives at his food delivery startup Wonder. About $100 million is coming from himself, Lore told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. The company has now raised $1.5 billion, with investors ranging from Amex Ventures to Nestle to Bain Capital Ventures.\n\nWonder will use the cash to expand from 11 locations to 35 by year-end. Lore is targeting 90 spots by the end of 2025.\n\nThe mission statement for Wonder is to democratize gourmet food. Lore is doing that by licensing the menus of popular chefs such as Bobby Flay and Michael Symon, making their iconic dishes inside Wonder's kitchens, and delivering them to diners' doorsteps.\n\n\"We have proven the business model,\" he contends.\n\nLore said a chunk of the money will go into various R&D initiatives, such as developing automated kitchens. \"We're continuing to look into what the next-generation kitchen looks like,\" he added.\n\nTo aid in the business's growth, Lore purchased meal delivery outfit Blue Apron for $103 million in late 2023.\n\nAfter founding Wonder in 2018, Lore took back the CEO reins in late 2022 and shifted the startup from delivering gourmet meals in food trucks to opening up physical locations. Lore thinks he could eventually have thousands of these marketplace-like kitchens across the country. Marc Lore, now CEO of Wonder, smiles at the Wall Street Journal Digital Conference in Laguna Beach, Calif., Oct. 17, 2017. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nTo say Lore, 52, is a serial entrepreneur with a long resume of successes is an understatement.\n\nHe founded Quidsi in 2005, a business made famous by its domain name, Diapers.com. Amazon (AMZN) bought Quidsi in 2010 for about $545 million. Lore worked at Amazon until 2013.\n\nHe then founded delivery startup Jet.com in 2014, which Walmart acquired two years later for $3.3 billion in cash. Lore then joined the retail giant to lead its US e-commerce operation, overseeing a complete rebirth of its digital business, including introducing same-day delivery services and expanding Walmart Marketplace.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart shut down Jet.com in March 2020, and Lore left his post as Walmart's US e-commerce chief in early 2021.\n\nSince leaving Walmart, he's launched Wonder and has been looking to start a utopian society dubbed Telosa. He is also now part owner of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves along with former MLB star Alex Rodriguez.\n\nWhen asked if he ever gets worried Wonder won't work out, Lore sounds like a typical entrepreneur with a lot of wins on the scoreboard.\n\n\"I don't waste any time thinking about what went wrong in the past, and don't spend any time worrying about the future. It's always in the now,\" said Lore.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

        "content": "Amazon Pharmacy, which launched in 2020, announced Tuesday that it was expanding same-day delivery to Los Angeles and New York. (Jerome Adamstein / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAmazon will soon offer same-day delivery of several prescription medications in Los Angeles and New York, yet another example of the online shopping giant’s bet on consumers’ growing dependence on ease and speed.\n\nAs Amazon Pharmacy expands into the nation’s two biggest markets, Angelenos and New Yorkers will be able to order several common medications, including those used to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and the flu, online and have them delivered on their doorstep within hours, the company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAmazon plans to offer the service in more than a dozen U.S. cities by the end of the year, the company said, noting that it already offers same-day medication delivery in a handful of cities, including Phoenix, Seattle and College Station, Texas, where it said deliveries are  made within an hour by drone. Although the service won't begin in the L.A. metro area until April, a company spokesperson said in an email that the service became available in San Bernardino, Riverside and Anaheim on Tuesday.\n\nThe company’s Amazon Prime service, which launched in 2005 and offers fast delivery of a wide variety of products, boasts more than 200 million members worldwide, but there is reason to expect consumers may be more reluctant about purchasing medications online.\n\nRead more:Column: Do you really want Amazon's new drugstore knowing your medical condition?\n\nAlthough the concept of getting medications delivered, particularly by mail, isn’t new, it still accounts for a relatively small percentage of drug purchases. Amazon acknowledged that reality in its Tuesday announcement, which linked to a consumer surveyfrom the global business consulting firm McKinsey & Co., which found that, in 2021, only 10% of prescriptions in the U.S. were purchased through mail-order or online pharmacies.\n\nBut the world of online medication sales is expanding rapidly.\n\nOne of Amazon’s biggest competitors in the pharmaceutical space, CVS, already offers speedy prescription delivery. And some digital prescription platforms, such as Santa Monica-based GoodRx and Cost Plus Drug Co., which was started by billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, have already built significant consumer bases.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more:Amazon is taking half of each sale from small-business merchants\n\nIn a video released Tuesday, the director of fulfillment for Amazon Pharmacy explained that a key feature of the company's pharmacy, which launched in 2020, is that its algorithms show customers an estimate of the cost of medications with their insurance co-pay and without insurance.\n\n“We’re again leaning into price transparency,” said Vin Gupta, the chief medical officer for Amazon Pharmacy. \"It's as affordable as possible.\"\n\nThat’s probably a smart move by the company, said Pranav Patel, a former researcher at the University of Toledo who has studied the field of pharmacy extensively.\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing medications, he said, many Americans care primarily about price transparency, and “convenience is just good PR.”\n\n“It’s about, ‘Am I paying the fair price for the drug?'” said Patel, who worked on a study that found that at least 1 in 5 prescriptions for many commonly prescribed generic medications would have been cheaper if the person had paid out of pocket and used discount cards from places such as Amazon and GoodRx instead of going through their insurance plans.\n\nIn its Tuesday announcement, the company said that medication delivery methods would be tailored to each area.\n\nIn the Greater Los Angeles region and across other suburban stretches, it plans to use Rivian electric vans as well as other vehicles to make deliveries; medications arriving on doorsteps in Manhattan could be transported by workers on e-bikes.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

        "content": "This article takes a look at 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Affordable Hidden Gem Southern Cities to Retire In.\n\nConsidering the Retirement Years Breakdown\n\nFor most adults, the forty-hour work week is what consumes the majority of their day. Add the time taken to commute, eat their meals, sleep, and work out, and little time is left over for leisure, family, and friends. What happens then when retirement rolls around and the forty-hour work week disappears, as does the commute attached to it? How does an individual with forty to fifty extra hours per week spend their time?\n\nAccording to the American Time Use Survey, the majority of a retiree’s time is spent either in sleep and personal care or leisure - about ten and seven hours per day, respectively. With so many hours spent on leisure, the quality of the activities that fill this period is of the essence. While gardening, learning to play an instrument, exercising, and cooking are all fun and cheap things to do in retirement, retirees sometimes want to break out of the vicinity of their own homes. As such, the place of retirement becomes a major contributing factor, pouring into how fulfilling an individual’s retirement period is.\n\nWhile America’s retired population is no stranger to earning a little extra income - you’ll find a host of senior citizens selling their belongings on eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) or running small home businesses - there’s only so much an eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) income can go. In reality, many senior citizens are relegated to a life spent on Social Security checks. These numbers, of course, are not favorable. In 2024, the average retiree will receive a meager $1,907 per month according to the Social Security Administration. Take out rent, utilities, groceries, and healthcare, and not a whole lot is left.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s two factors to consider when deciding on where to retire - affordability and the quality of life that the area provides. This brings American retirees to a choice - retire abroad or within the States. A retirement abroad boasts its own benefits - the cost of living is often lower due to currency values, senior citizens get to explore new cultures, and the weather can often be more favorable. Those who do decide to embark on an overseas retirement often search for the most affordable places to retire in the world.\n\nOf course, not every retiree will want to leave the States. Some have family and friends that they want to stay close to, some have health issues that prevent them from traveling long distances, and others still will not jump for joy at the thought of moving to a completely new country with new languages, cuisines, and cultures. For these, the main question remains - where to retire in America?\n\nWith how vast America is, thinning down your options becomes a task in itself. The South of America, however, is a considerable option. Many Southern cities boast lower costs of living, favorable climates, and of course, delectable Southern delicacies. Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) states that the average US one-bedroom rental sits at $1,599, a figure that is lower in many Southern states. For instance, Delaware's figure is $1,425, North Carolina's is $1,200, and West Virginia's is $750.\n\nSimilarly, Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN) quotes the average US house to be priced at $412,219. This number is considerably higher than Georgia's median of $361,800, Kentucky's $250,400, and Arkansas' $240,900. For retirees who may be surviving on Social Security checks - a mere $1,907 a month in 2024 according to the Social Security Administration - or an otherwise limited budget, the South's price-friendly accommodation acts as a strong pull factor.\n\nTo facilitate present and future retirees in contemplating a retirement move to the South, we have compiled the following list of 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in. 15 Affordable Hidden Gem Southern Cities to Retire In\n\nPixabay/Public domain\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile this list of 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in, we consulted several sources including our list of 20 Best Kept Secret Places to Retire in USA, as well as external sources like Southern Living, U.S. News & World Report, Finance Buzz, and The Travel. The United States Census Bureau defines the following states as Southern: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n\nOnce a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their average figure for a one-bedroom rental, their average monthly grocery bill for a single person, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, grocery figures were taken from the Economic Policy Institute, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). Once these rankings were assigned, places that did not have one-bedroom rental listings were removed. A cumulative score was then assigned to each city, with the 15 highest-scoring cities making our list of 15 affordable hidden gem Southern cities to retire in.\n\nFor cities that gained an equal score, their rent figures were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\n\nIt is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its generative AI capabilities on the back of its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which has been its key growth driver. Shares of Amazon have gained 83.3% over a year.\r\n\r\nThe latest partnership with a South Korean AI startup called Upstage is a testament to the same.\r\n\r\nAs part of the deal, Upstage launched its small language model (SLM) called SOLAR MINI on AWS. It has also selected AWS to train SOLAR MINI with the help of Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nSOLAR MINI is capable of performing various language tasks in Korean and English. The tasks include understanding, summarizing, translating and predicting new content.\r\n\r\nThe model eliminates the requirement of training generative AI models from scratch, thus enabling customers to get started with generative AI seamlessly.\r\n\r\nAs SLMs are lightweight compared with LLMs, SOLAR MINI is well-equipped to run the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions at lower costs, given a training dataset of 10.7 billion parameters.\r\n\r\nNotably, SOLAR MINI is available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart and AWS Marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe underlined collaboration is expected to aid AWS in gaining strong traction among enterprises of all sizes across various industries like entertainment, healthcare, research, e-commerce and education.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon’s Growing Generative AI Efforts\n\nIn addition to the Upstage deal, AWS recently extended its collaboration with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with the generative AI technology.\r\n\r\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform, which was introduced at GTC 2024, will be available on AWS. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs. AWS also intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU.\r\n\r\nApart from this, AWS offers Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nThe company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.\r\n\r\nAWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAWS’s solidifying prospects in this promising market are expected to continue aiding its performance. Moreover, its expanding portfolio will drive its customer momentum, which, in turn, will likely aid its dominant position in the cloud computing market, wherein companies like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google are also gaining steam.\r\n\r\nAmazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of the total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wisconsin Supreme Court lets ruling stand that declared Amazon drivers to be employees",
        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit Tuesday brought by online retailer Amazon’s logistics subsidiary, which had sought to overturn a lower court's ruling that it had misclassified delivery drivers as independent contractors instead of employees.\n\nThe court, in a unanimous decision, said the appeal was “improvidently granted,” meaning the Supreme Court should not have reviewed the case. That decision, issued after the court heard oral arguments, leaves a 2023 Wisconsin appeals court ruling against Amazon in place.\n\nThat ruling found that drivers in the Amazon Flex program are a part of the state’s unemployment insurance system and entitled to jobless pay if they are laid off. The decision means the subsidiary, Amazon Logistics, will likely be hit with a tax bill of more than $200,000.\n\nJustice Ann Walsh Bradley, in a concurring decision, said the reason the court dismissed the case was that further review “would not serve any meaningful purpose” or any “further development of the law.” Justice Rebecca Bradley, in a separate writing, faulted Bradley for trying to explain the court's decision, saying it “will only sow additional confusion.”\n\nThe case was closely watched for what effect a ruling would have on workers in the “gig economy.”\n\nLabor unions, along with the state Department of Workforce Development, pushed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to recognize the Amazon Flex workers as employees.\n\nAttorneys for Wisconsin and Amazon did not immediately return messages Tuesday.\n\nCourts across the country have been grappling with similar questions as states struggle with how to treat workers who are hired for a particular job, often at the push of a button through a smartphone app, to deliver food, groceries, packages or perform a variety of tasks.\n\n“The gig economy is clogging up the court with all of this stuff, all the time,” said Samantha Prince, assistant professor of law at Penn State Dickinson College of Law and an expert on worker misclassification and the gig economy. “It’s just nuts. We really need this stuff to be resolved and stay resolved and stop with all the uncertainty for everybody.”\n\nStory continues\n\nPrince said even though the court declined to issue a ruling in this case, allowing the appeals court ruling to stand that found the Amazon Flex drivers were employees is “one of the many dominoes that are starting to fall.”\n\n“And even though this case only applies to Amazon Flex drivers, it will likely resonate through the other gig company court cases,” she said. “The more cases that find that gig company drivers are employees, the more companies are going to have to pay their rightful share.”\n\nEvery state has its own laws determining whether workers are employees or independent contractors, Prince said. Those laws set the rules for what wages and overtime the workers must be paid and, in this case, whether they are subject to unemployment benefits that the employer must contribute toward.\n\nEmployees who got approved for the Amazon Flex program could download an app for their personal phones showing blocks when they could deliver packages for the company. Workers would scan packages at the Amazon warehouse in Milwaukee and use their personal vehicles to deliver them, using a route suggested by Amazon.\n\nAfter one Amazon Flex worker was fired, he filed for unemployment insurance. The Department of Workforce Development conducted an audit of more than 1,000 Amazon Logistics drivers between 2016 and 2018 and concluded the vast majority of drivers were employees, not independent contractors, and therefore eligible for unemployment insurance payments. The state told Amazon in 2018 that it owed more than $205,000 in unemployment insurance premiums.\n\nThe Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission upheld the state DWD determination that the drivers were employees. Amazon Logistics sued and a Waukesha County circuit court judge ruled the drivers were independent contractors. Last year, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned that ruling, agreeing with the state that the drivers were employees. That set up the appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",

        "content": "When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) share price is up 98% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 74% (ignoring dividends).\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the last half decade, Amazon.com became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so investors may expect to see an increasing share price.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 83% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 15%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. If you would like to research Amazon.com in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut note: Amazon.com may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A major commuter bridge in Baltimore collapsed after being rammed by a container ship, causing vehicles to plunge into the water and threatening chaos at one of the most important ports on the US East Coast.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Trump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction US CEOs Extend China Stay on Last-Minute Invite to Meet Xi\n\nThe Maryland Transportation Authority issued an alert on X telling drivers not to use Interstate 695. Kevin Cartwright of the Baltimore City Fire Department described it as “a mass casualty, multi-agency incident” in an audio interview with CNN, adding as many as 20 people could be in the water.\n\nThe disaster at the Francis Scott Key Bridge happened early Tuesday. It’s likely to cause huge disruption — both for shipping at one of the busiest ports on the US East Coast and on the roads — now that a key link has been severed on the major highway encircling Baltimore.\n\nThe vessel is the Dali, which sails under the flag of Singapore. The 32,000-ton ship was built in 2015. A London-based spokesman for Synergy Marine, its manager, said the Dali had around 4,900 containers on board at the time. Company executives were traveling to the site to assess the situation.\n\nThe bridge allows commercial ships to enter the Port of Baltimore, one of the top ports in the US in terms of volume and value of cargoes. It is the largest US port for handling cars and light trucks.\n\nAt least 21 ships are in waters to the west of the collapsed bridge. About half of them are tugs. There also at least three bulk carriers, one vehicles carrier and a small tanker.\n\nAn extended shutdown is going to bring chaos for travelers just ahead of the Easter holiday weekend on the already clogged corridor between New York and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Baltimore port handled 847,158 autos and light trucks in 2023, the most of any US port for the thirteenth straight year, according to a state of Maryland website. The port also handled large volumes of imported sugar, gypsum and coffee, as well as exported coal.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dali was carrying containers from East Asia to the US East Coast via the Panama Canal. It can haul the equivalent of about 9,700 steel boxes, about half the size of the industry’s largest ships.\n\nIt arrived at the Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore on March 24 after delivering to the Port of New York /New Jersey, and had offloaded a small amount of containers before attempting its return journey to Asia early Tuesday morning.\n\n(Updates with cargo information in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "Disney had big plans in India — here's why it's pulling back",
        "content": "Disney once embraced the opportunity to expand into India. Now it’s backing away.\n\nFive years ago, the media giant’s $71 billion 21st Century Fox deal gave it access to the Indian TV network Star, which hosts dozens of sports and entertainment channels, along with its streaming service Hotstar.\n\nBut the House of Mouse is now scaling back its ambitions in the country and taking a back seat to a local player. Last month, Disney said it would merge Star — once viewed as a crown jewel — with Indian telecom giant Reliance Industries in a joint venture estimated to be worth $8.5 billion. Disney will be a minority shareholder in the entity.\n\nThe decision highlights the challenges posed by the Indian entertainment market despite its allure of growth, multiple analysts told Yahoo Finance. While India offers the opportunity to reach millions of viewers, competition is fierce and success requires a significant amount of investment that US media companies may not be prepared to make as they grapple with cord-cutting challenges domestically.\n\nIndia, which boasts a population of more than 1.4 billion, has become a media hotspot with projected TV and streaming-related revenue growth of 11% in 2024. That compares with much more muted growth in other developing countries, according to analytics firm Ampere Analysis.\n\nBut the market has been a hard one for US media companies to crack. First of all, it’s difficult for companies to create a direct relationship with Indian consumers, who largely rely on mobile operators to gain access to streaming services due to limited broadband infrastructure.\n\nIndian consumers also have a relatively low willingness to pay for streaming platforms thanks to free, ad-supported models from local content providers and rampant piracy.\n\nLocal content providers — the top four being Star India, Viacom18, Sony, and Zee Entertainment — have largely been able to service India's vast population, which spans many different languages and dialects. Reliance, which has leveraged the success of its booming telecom business, has added yet another competitive layer to the diverse Indian TV market.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It's quite a fragmented media landscape,\" Neil Anderson, senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, told Yahoo Finance, noting local players have much larger ad businesses in addition to stronger production capabilities around entertainment and sports.\n\nIt’s not just local competitors taking market share. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) — two tech giants with significantly higher free cash flow levels compared to their legacy media counterparts — have made inroads with higher-income Indian consumers by offering localized content, said Mihir Shah, vice president of research firm Media Partners Asia.\n\n\"The real story in India has been the growth of the middle- to higher-income consumer,\" Shah said. \"That's a segment which many of the tech platforms [like] Netflix and Prime Video are really dominating.\"\n\nThe challenge, however, comes in penetrating the next 50 million households when income levels drop and more investment is needed to break through, he said.\n\nAll this has translated into tough times for Disney. The company lost the rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket matches through Hotstar to Reliance in 2022.\n\nIn another setback, Hotstar lost popular HBO content including top programs like \"Succession,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" and \"The Last of Us.\" Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), the parent company of HBO, instead made the content available through Indian streaming service JioCinema, which is owned by Viacom18.\n\nIn its latest fiscal year ending in September, Disney reported 37.6 million Hotstar subscribers, down a whopping 39% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nOn top of subscriber headwinds, foreign exchange has also been an issue.\n\nThe value of the Indian rupee, for example, has dropped roughly 20% since Disney's Fox acquisition in 2019. That has impacted metrics like average revenue per user (ARPU) for Hotstar subscribers, which is pennies on the dollar compared to where the metric stands for Disney's US-based subscribers.\n\nDuring an earnings call in November, Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted to challenges in the Indian market but also said the company \"would like to stay\" and that its linear business \"actually does quite well\" in the country.\n\nIndustry observers told Yahoo Finance that the problems Disney faced in its core businesses likely played a role in the company’s decision to pull back.\n\nIn the years since the Fox merger, Disney’s parks business has slowed, its linear TV division has declined, and its streaming business, which launched at the end of 2019, is not yet profitable. Meanwhile, activist Nelson Peltz renewed his push to shake up Disney's board after the stock price hit multiyear record lows last year.\n\n\"It's really about putting the oxygen mask on first and saying, 'What's core to our business?'\" David Wisnia, partner and managing director of media and entertainment at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, told Yahoo Finance. Disney CEO Bob Iger at the 96th Oscars Nominee Luncheon at the Beverly Hilton on Feb. 12, 2024, in Beverly Hills, California. (Michael Buckner via Getty Images)\n\nDisney’s not the only US media giant to reverse course on India recently. Just two weeks after Disney’s joint venture announcement, Paramount Global (PARA) said it was selling its 13% stake in Indian media company Viacom18 to Reliance for about $517 million.\n\n\"These companies need to focus on their 'core,' which is streaming,\" Wisnia said. \"So we have to fix that first and make sure that is a profitable venture before we invest in things that are not going to show profitability for years to come.\"\n\nThat may mean a fast-growing market like India just isn’t a priority today for an industry already under significant pressure.\n\n“Legacy companies don’t have the luxury of time,” Wisnia stressed. “Their priorities are on immediate returns.”\n\nStill, the long game is one Disney seems open to playing.\n\n\"Disney is still choosing to have skin in the game,\" Media Partners Asia’s Shah said, referencing the company's 37% holding in its joint venture partnership with Reliance. \"They're getting a decent enough valuation and they can use the proceeds to recalibrate the business in the home market.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Are Considerably Cheaper Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend has changed the corporate landscape more than the advent of the internet. However, the arrival of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution may give history a run for its money.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be delegated to humans. The incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to \"learn\" over time and become more proficient at their tasks, is what ultimately gives AI utility in practically every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock has soared thanks to the AI revolution\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In the span of a little over one year, it's become the foundational-infrastructure play in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for a greater-than 90% share of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia is still in the process of ramping its production. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which should help ease supply chain issues for Nvidia and allow the company to meet more of its customers' orders.\n\nBut when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, they usually are.\n\nIn addition to contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own to either complement or replace Nvidia's data-center infrastructure. Even if Nvidia is able to maintain some degree of advantage(s) over these in-house GPUs from its top customers, future orders from these four businesses are liable to taper.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia finds itself at risk of cannibalizing its own gross margin as it expands production. The reason data-center sales more than tripled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) is because of GPU scarcity. Demand was so strong for its A100 and H100 chips that the company was able to dramatically increase the price of these units. As Nvidia's GPU production, and that of its competition, increases, industrywide GPU scarcity and Nvidia's pricing power should wane.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the most damning factor of all might be Nvidia's valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget Nvidia: These two \"Magnificent Seven\" components are considerably cheaper\n\nThere are a number of ways to \"value\" stocks. While the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio works well for mature businesses, it doesn't do a particularly good job of valuing the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's largest and most influential businesses (listed in order of descending market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia  Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven businesses offer well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in their respective industries. They're also well known for reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth initiatives. That's why cash flow tends to be the best measure of value when analyzing Nvidia and its peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs of the closing bell on March 22, Nvidia was valued at just north of 30 times Wall Street's forward-year cash-flow estimates. That makes Nvidia the priciest stock within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe good news for investors is that two other Magnificent Seven components with artificial intelligence ties are historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus cash-flow forecasts, Alphabet is expected to generate more than $11 in cash flow per share in 2025. Based on its closing price for March 22, this places Alphabet at roughly 13.5 times forward-year cash flow. Not only is this less than half the multiple Nvidia trades at, but it represents a roughly 24% discount to Alphabet's price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nThe operating segment that makes Alphabet tick is Google. In February, Google registered a 91.6% share of worldwide internet search, according to GlobalStats. It's sustained at least a 90% monthly share of global search dating back nine years. Being the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s), it suggests Google should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut it's Alphabet's cloud-infrastructure service platform, Google Cloud, which offers the most promise in terms of cash-flow growth. Google Cloud accounted for a 10% share of global cloud-infrastructure service spend during the September-ended quarter, and this segment delivered its first year of profits in 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also where Alphabet has many of its artificial intelligence tie-ins. It's allowing customers to use generative AI solutions to build applications within the cloud that can improve customer interactions and/or help businesses better target consumers with their advertising.\n\nEnterprise cloud spending looks to be in its early stages of ramping up, which suggests double-digit sales growth can continue for the higher-margin Google Cloud.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably cheaper AI stock than Nvidia is none other than e-commerce titan Amazon.\n\nDespite hitting a fresh 52-week high last week, Amazon ended March 22 at a multiple of only 13 times Wall Street's estimated forward-year cash flow. This represents a 43% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period, and it's markedly lower then Nvidia's multiple-to-forward-year cash flow.\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online retail platform. The company's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year, which was more than 31 percentage points above its next-closest competitor.\n\nBut dig beneath the surface and you'll find that online retail sales generate low margins and don't contribute much to Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Rather, the company's ancillary operating segments, which include Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription services, and advertising services do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nWhereas Google Cloud accounts for 10% of global cloud-infrastructure service spending, AWS sits at the top of the pecking order with a 31% share, according to estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is deploying generative AI solutions in a multitude of ways within its cloud platform to allow users to build applications. On an annualized run-rate basis, AWS is generating nearly $97 billion in sales and is consistently responsible for most of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon's other ancillary segments aren't slouches, either. Luring more than 2 billion unique users to its website each month has fueled ad sales for Amazon. Likewise, it crossed above 200 million monthly worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of the National Football League for Thursday Night Football.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "RTH: This Powerhouse ETF Proves That Retail Is Not Dead",
        "content": "Anyone who tells you that “retail is dead” likely hasn’t looked at the VanEck Retail ETF (NASDAQ:RTH), which owns some powerhouse retail stocks and has been surprisingly outperforming the broader market over the past five and 10 years.\n\nI’m bullish on this underrated VanEck ETF based on its quietly strong track record of generating strong returns over a long time frame and its strong portfolio of highly-rated retail stocks, which go beyond what many investors may typically think of as retail.\n\nWhat Is the RTH ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor VanEck, RTH invests in an index called the “MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index (MVRTHTR), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in retail distribution, wholesalers, on-line, direct mail and TV retailers, multi-line retailers, specialty retailers and food and other staples retailers.” RTH gives investors access to “25 of the world’s largest and most traded retailers.”\n\nVanEck noted, “Technology and innovation are remaking the retail industry,” an important fact that we’ll delve into when we discuss RTH’s holdings in the next section.\n\nMore Than Just the Mall and Shopping Centers\n\nRTH owns 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 71.5% of the fund. Below, you’ll find an overview of RTH’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nWhen many people think of retailers, they first think of half-empty clothing and footwear stores at the mall fighting to stay relevant amid declining foot traffic or moribund discount retailers in declining shopping centers. Understandably, this is most likely a part of the market that they are keen to avoid. But RTH looks beyond these uninspiring examples and shows that there is much more to the retail sector.\n\nYou may be surprised to find a stock like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) here, as many people think of the mega-cap $1.9 trillion behemoth as a tech stock. But its massive logistics network and expansive shopping platform, which gives customers the convenience of shopping from home with one-click checkout, not to mention free and fast delivery for Amazon Prime members, have made it a retail juggernaut to be reckoned with. Amazon is by far the fund’s top holding, with a weighting of 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond Amazon, RTH features large positions in several other shining stars within the retail sector, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which have weightings of 9.1%, 8.2%, and 7.2% within the fund, respectively.\n\nThey may not be the most glamorous or exciting stocks out there at first glance, but they have been incredible performers for a long time. You might not be surprised to hear that much-hyped shares of Amazon have returned 888.1% over the past decade.\n\nBut don’t overlook the other three stocks, which haven’t exactly been slouches either. In fact, Costco has narrowly outperformed Amazon with a total return of 905.0% over the past 10 years, while Home Depot clocks in with a total return of 519.0%, and Walmart has returned a respectable 198.8% over the same time frame.\n\nEssentially, RTH has harnessed the strong performance of these four large holdings to propel itself to excellent returns over the past decade, as we’ll discuss further in the next section.\n\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that while all four of these stocks have been home runs over the past decade, they also all boast Outperform-equivalent TipRanks Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nThe Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Top holding Amazon enjoys a 9 out of 10 Smart Score, and so does Home Depot. Meanwhile, Costco and Walmart all receive Smart Scores of 8 out of 10.\n\nFurther down the list of top 10 holdings, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and McKesson (NYSE:MCK), which many may associate more with healthcare than retail but are nevertheless retailers in their own right, both receive ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores.\n\nRTH itself receives an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\n\nSurprisingly Strong Performance\n\nAs discussed above, top holdings like Amazon, Home Depot, Costco, and Walmart have helped drive RTH to strong returns over the years. How strong are we talking?\n\nAs of February 29th, the retail-themed ETF has produced a three-year annualized return of 11.3%. This slightly trails the return of the broader market. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) sports a three-year annualized return of 11.9% as of the same date.\n\nBut once you zoom out to a longer time frame, RTH actually beats the broader market over the past five and 10 years. As of February 29th, RTH has an excellent five-year annualized return of 16.0%, narrowly beating out VOO’s return of 14.7%. Similarly, RTH’s 10-year annualized return of 14.3% also beats VOO’s 10-year annualized return of 12.7%.\n\nWhat Is RTH’s Expense Ratio?\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.35%, RTH doesn’t necessarily stand out for being dirt cheap, but it is still significantly less expensive than the average expense ratio for all ETFs, which is currently 0.57%.\n\nDoes RTH Pay a Dividend?\n\nDividends are not the main attraction here, but RTH is a dividend payer and currently yields 1.0%.\n\nIs RTH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, RTH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average RTH stock price target of $227.80 implies 8.1% upside potential.\n\nMore Than Meets the Eye\n\nWhile some investors will understandably shudder at the “retail” part of RTH’s name, its impressive performance over the long term and its strong underlying holdings show why you can’t always judge a book by its cover and why it pays to look beneath the surface and evaluate an ETF’s holdings.\n\nI’m bullish on RTH, given its admirable performance over the years and its strong portfolio, which consists of large positions in long-term retail winners with impressive Smart Scores like Amazon, Home Depot, Costco, and Walmart.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "In the latest market close, Amazon (AMZN) reached $179.71, with a +0.47% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.41%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.27%.\n\nThe the stock of online retailer has risen by 2.22% in the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.43% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.05%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Amazon will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.81, indicating a 161.29% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $142.42 billion, showing a 11.83% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $4.08 per share and a revenue of $641.36 billion, demonstrating changes of +40.69% and +11.58%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Amazon. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 1.26% increase. Right now, Amazon possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, Amazon currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 43.82. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 20.11 for its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, we should mention that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.56. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Internet - Commerce industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.64.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 88, which puts it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Amazon.com (AMZN) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Amazon (AMZN) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon.com is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 40.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 21.1%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon.com is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.1%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.9%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Amazon.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon.com a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Amazon.com well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Citigroup Upgrades Six REITs In One Morning",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve's reassertion this week that despite recent gains in the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), it still envisions three rate cuts coming in 2024, sparking a rally in real estate investment trusts (REITs). On March 22, three analysts from Citigroup kept that enthusiasm going by upgrading a half dozen REITs and raising price targets on all six.\n\nTake a look at the REITs receiving upgrades this week, along with some positives that each REIT has going for it.\n\nMacerich Co. (NYSE:MAC) is a Santa Monica, California-based retail REIT that specializes in the acquisition, leasing and management of 44 regional town center malls across the U.S. Macerich was founded in 1972 and had its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994.\n\nMacerich has recently developed new leadership. On March 1, Jackson Hsieh was appointed president and CEO of the company. On March 12, Hsieh and other Macerich senior executives celebrated 30 years of being in business as a public company by ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nOn March 22, Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph upgraded Macerich from Sell to Neutral and raised the price target from $8 to $17.\n\nOmega Healthcare Investors Inc. (NYSE:OHI) is a Hunt Valley, Maryland-based triple-net equity healthcare REIT that provides financing, capital and leasing to 69 operators among 862 senior housing, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities across 42 states throughout the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Omega Healthcare Investors has no part in the day-to-day management of these facilities, which are run by the operators.\n\nOn March 22, Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph upgraded Omega Healthcare from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $32 to $35.\n\nOn Feb. 26, Wells Fargo analyst Connor Siversky also upgraded Omega Healthcare Investors, from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised the price target from $31 to $35.\n\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) is a Tysons, Virginia-based hotel REIT with 43 hotels and resorts with over 26,000 rooms, located in prime U.S. markets from Hawaii to Massachusetts that have high barriers to entry. Park Hotels is a small-cap stock with a market cap of $3.737 billion. Its occupancy rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 71%, up from 69.5% in Q4 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nPark was established as an independent company in January 2017 following its spinoff from Hilton. In September 2019, Park acquired Chesapeake Lodging Trust to add premium-brand hotels and resorts in prime markets such as Miami, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nOn March 22, Citigroup analyst Smedes Rose upgraded Park Hotels & Resorts from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $14 to $20.\n\nSeveral other analysts have recently come out with positive ratings on Park Hotels. Truist Securities has a Buy and $21 price target and Deutsche Bank has a Buy rating and a $24 price target on Park.\n\nTanger Inc. (NYSE:SKT), formerly called Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc., is a Greensboro, North Carolina-based retail REIT that owns 40 indoor shopping centers and outdoor factory outlet malls with 15.6 million square feet and over 3,000 stores across 20 states and in Canada. Tanger Factory Outlet Centers was founded in 1981 and had its IPO in May 1993. Tanger's occupancy rate at the end of 2023 was 97.3%.\n\nTanger was the second-leading REIT overall in 2023, with a total return of 63.58%, overcoming the popular idea that in-store retail shopping is in decline because of the popularity of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers. Its total return so far in 2024 is 5.09%.\n\nOn Feb. 15, Tanger reported excellent fourth-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.52 beat the estimate of $0.50. Revenue of $127.48 million beat the estimate of $119.04 million and was 9.46% above revenue from the fourth quarter of 2022 of $116.46 million. Additionally, full-year core FFO was announced in a range from $2.01-$2.09 per share, with a midpoint above the analyst consensus estimate of $2.03 per share.\n\nOn March 22, Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman upgraded Tanger from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $30 to $33. Tanger continues to perform well and the Citigroup upgrade should help the share price as well.\n\nEssential Properties Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:EPRT) is a Princeton, New Jersey-based diversified REIT that owns and manages single-tenant properties with net leases for service-oriented and experience-based businesses. Essential Properties was founded in 2016 and has a market cap of $4.4 billion. It has a portfolio of 1,873 properties across 48 states. Its properties, which have a 99.8% occupancy rate, have a weighted average lease term (WALT) of 14 years.\n\nOn March 22, Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph upgraded Essential Properties from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $25 to $28.50. On March 13, B. Riley Securities also reiterated a Buy on Essential Properties and raised its price target from $27.50 to $29 per\n\nTotal occupancy and rent collection are extremely important aspects of a REIT, and from that standpoint, it's easy to see why analysts have upgraded Essential Properties' ratings and price targets this month.\n\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH) is a Calabasas, California-based residential REIT that purchases, develops, renovates and leases existing and new single-family homes as rental properties. American Homes 4 Rent was created in 2012 and in less than 12 years has built a portfolio of 58,470 single-family units across 21 states. Its largest concentration of homes is in the Southeastern U.S., where population growth has been explosive. Its IPO was in July 2013.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of last year, American Homes 4 Rent had a same-home average occupied days of 96.2%.\n\nOn March 22, Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph upgraded American Homes 4 Rent from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $37 to $41.\n\nOther analysts have also supported American Homes recently. On March 20, Mizuho analyst Haendel St. Juste maintained a Buy on American Homes and raised the price target from $37 to $39. On March 12, JMP Securities analyst Aaron Hecht maintained American Homes with an Outperform and raised the price target from $38 to $41.\n\nExplore Opportunities Beyond REITs\n\nWhile publicly traded REITs offer a convenient way to invest in real estate, we believe that some of the most compelling opportunities lie in the private market.

        "title": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Could Be the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bet Right Now (and It's Not Nvidia).",
        "content": "If you're looking to invest in a company likely to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) today and down the road, you may consider buying a \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. With a moniker inspired by the 1960 Western, these players are technology leaders, and each is investing in the area of AI. The one that has become almost synonymous with this hot technology is Nvidia because this company's chips power AI -- and dominate the industry.\n\nThough Nvidia makes a great buy, another stock could make an even better AI bet right now. That's because this company is likely to benefit from Nvidia's strength as well as its own AI products and services -- and it's involved in two other high-growth businesses. On top of this, this company uses AI to streamline its operations, which should lead to earnings gains in the coming years. So, investing in this player gives you a complete AI package and more. Let's take a close look at this AI powerhouse to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA leader in two growth markets\n\nAnd this top stock is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a leader in the growth markets of e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon is positioned to win in these two markets thanks to its earnings track record and leadership in these areas as well as moves it made in recent times to favor growth.\n\nFaced with rising inflation back in 2022, Amazon posted its first annual loss in nearly a decade. Higher costs weighed on customers' wallets and on the company's costs. But Amazon quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure and shifting investment into growth areas like technology infrastructure.\n\nThe efforts worked, helping Amazon to report double-digit revenue gains last year and a tripling of operating income. The company also shifted to an inflow of cash of more than $36 billion from an outflow a year earlier. Amazon's cost cuts, moves to become more efficient across its fulfillment network, and expansion of Amazon Web Services' (AWS) offerings helped the company manage during tough times and recover.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, importantly, these efforts should help Amazon thrive in better times, as an improved cost structure will favor earnings growth. For example, in the U.S., Amazon has shifted from a national to a regional fulfillment model, a move that's lowering its cost to serve.\n\nAmazon's AI potential\n\nSo, without even considering Amazon's presence in AI, the stock already looks attractive -- but it's AI potential makes the picture even brighter. Amazon is set to benefit from AI in two ways. The company uses AI to gain in efficiency and optimize the shopping experience for customers. For instance, AI designs the best delivery routes to get packages to their destination fast, and AI suggests items for customers based on their previous purchases. These and other AI-powered moves lower Amazon's costs, and by satisfying customers, keep them coming back.\n\nAnd the second way Amazon should score an AI win has to do with AWS. The cloud service will benefit from Nvidia's successes because it offers customers Nvidia chips and services. So, businesses looking to get in on Nvidia AI products can do so right through AWS. And AWS also offers a variety of its own products and services, from its chips for training and inference to a fully managed service that gives customers access to top large language models.\n\nThe AWS customer\n\nThis means AWS could serve all or most of customers' AI needs, making it a go-to place for those developing AI projects. And since AWS is the world's leading cloud company, it already has a huge audience -- an AWS customer interested in launching AI is more likely to do so through AWS than turning to another cloud provider.\n\nAmazon over the years has proven its strength by growing earnings -- and in recent times demonstrated its ability to manage tough periods and come out a winner. And its investment in AI and leadership in cloud services should help it to win in this promising technology too. Amazon trades for 42x forward earnings estimates, which is reasonable considering its dominance in its markets and its AI prospects. That's why this Magnificent Seven stock could be the best AI bet right now -- and one you'll want to hold onto for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The jury’s in, and the verdict is a resounding yes to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year. Following the announcement on Wednesday, all three major indexes rallied to record highs, with the S&P 500 blowing past the 5,200 level for the first time. Hence, it is perhaps an ideal time to bet on the best S&P 500 stocks.\n\nThe Fed left rates unchanged but will cut them at least three times before the end of the year. Investors will breathe a sigh of relief, considering how the recent surge in inflation readings would’ve resulted in fewer rate cuts than expected. With that said, the stock market is expected to continue booming, offering an incredible wealth-building opportunity for investors now. Here are three S&P 500 stocks that stand out, in my opinion.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Logistics activity on the Amazon (AMZN) site of Vélizy-Villacoublay in France. Packages are sorted by workers on conveyors.\n\nSource: Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a growth stock for ages. Its ability to evolve with the rapidly expanding tech space continues to amaze us. During the peak of the ChatGPT explosion, I felt Amazon would play second fiddle to other tech giants, at least in the AI realm. However, it has completely shattered my reservations with a multi-faceted AI strategy that’s second to none.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is entering the generative AI space with its investments in Claude-owner Anthropic. Claude AI is being dubbed as one of the most powerful chatbots in the market, rivaling ChatGPT across key benchmarks. Also, it’s expanding into the AI chip scene, and Trainium and Inferium are positioning it as potential in the sector. CEO Andy Jassy said AI could bring forth ‘tens of billions of dollars’ in sales over the next few years.\n\nFurthermore, its powerful cloud computing arm in AWS provides a robust infrastructure to scale and meet AI demands effortlessly. Integrating both technologies enhances AI’s computational abilities while leveraging AWS’s massive data storage and processing capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing the divestment of its consumer products arm, the new-look Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) deserves attention. The pharmaceutical giant spun off its consumer products division in Kenvue to focus on more lucrative sectors, including medical devices and pharmaceuticals.\n\nFollowing its strategic recalibration, the company posted encouraging results in its fourth quarter (Q4). Q4 revenues shot up to $21.4 billion due to strong showings in its pharma and MedTech segments. Sales beat estimates by $378 million, while its EPS of $2.29 bested estimates by a cent. As we advance, its management expects to continue growing its top line in the 5% to 7% range from 2025 to 2030.\n\nFurthermore, it has plenty of liquidity to continue rewarding its shareholders, with almost $23 billion in cash and short-term investments. With an excellent 3% yield, it has grown its dividend payouts for 61 consecutive years. Also, it trades at an attractive 14.60 times forward earnings, 28% lower than the sector median.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a cultural phenomenon that has been a household name for over a century. Though it’s known mainly for its popular soft drink, ‘Coke,’ it has diversified into various other beverages to grow its revenue base. It boasts more than a 45% market share in the global non-alcoholic beverages market, establishing it as a juggernaut in the niche.\n\nDespite the inflationary pressures last year, it came through with flying colors, delivering solid top-and-bottom-line beats across both lines. Its Q4 report showed organic sales up 12% compared to the 8.8% consensus estimate. Additionally, as we look ahead, the company’s full-year adjusted organic sales growth is estimated to fall in the 6% to 7% range compared to the 6% consensus. Moreover, its dividend remains unshaken. Recently, it raised its payout by 5.4%, cementing its position as a Dividend King.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights American Woodmark, Burlington Stores, Central Garden &amp; Pet, DHI Group and Amazon.com",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 25, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Woodmark AMWD, Burlington Stores BURL, Central Garden & Pet CENT, DHI Group DHX, and Amazon.com AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Top Growth Stocks to Buy as Fear of Recession Ebbs\n\nThe U.S. economy expanded robustly in the final three months of 2023 and crushed recession fearmongering. Despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening measures to curb inflationary pressure, the economy accelerated at an annualized pace of 3.3% in the final quarter of 2023 and expanded 2.5% last year.\n\nThe economy is now well-poised to trounce recession concerns this year as well and chug along. The Federal Open Market Committee, in its latest policy meeting, kept the benchmark overnight borrowing rate unchanged and reiterated three quarter-percentage-point interest rate cuts by the end of this year. This would mean the first interest rate cuts since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nNow, interest rate cuts are a blessing in disguise for economic growth. After all, it helps in increasing consumer outlays and reduces the cost of borrowing. Talking about consumer spending, American shoppers did open up their wallets in recent times despite sticky inflation and dwindling pandemic savings. Consumers remained resilient, banking on strength in the labor market, a tell-tale sign that the economy continues to stay healthy.\n\nSales at retail outlets rose 0.6% in February from a decline of 1.1% in January, according to the Commerce Department. Notably, spending at retail outlets increased in the seven of the past 10 months through February. Spending at retail outlets primarily improved as employers added jobs at a steady clip last month, while average hourly earnings increased.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost importantly, the Conference Board's leading indicator for the economy advanced 0.1% in February, its first increase since February 2022. The gauge is known for predicting whether the economy is improving or getting worse.\n\nHence, with the economy booming amid little sign of a recession, the stock market is well-positioned to scale northward. This calls for investing in growth stocks such as American Woodmark, Burlington Stores, Central Garden & Pet, DHI Group, and Amazon.com.\n\nThese stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAmerican Woodmark is the third-largest manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets. American Woodmark currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 3% over the past 60 days. AMWD's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14.4%.\n\nBurlington Stores is a retailer of branded apparel products.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best stocks to buy for grandchildren. To skip the detailed analysis of financial markets and analysts’ outlook, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Buy For Grandchildren.\n\nThe world held its breath for almost three years as the global financial markets and economy suffered from one shock after another. The bears were sure that the US economy would be hit by a recession in 2023 or 2024, but the market proved all their predictions wrong and made an impressive comeback on the back of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile the bulls are quite optimistic about the future, there are still concerns regarding a soft landing or a mild recession. A JPMorgan report points out that there are indications of slowing growth in the current year but not a total collapse and still holds the belief that a mild recession could take place in the next year. The report states:\n\n“The challenge for investors: the damage to public sector finances from mega-deficits, markets that already price in a very soft landing and the concentrated contribution of megacap stocks. In 2023, S&P 500 earnings were flat; they were up 33% for the 7 megacap stocks and down 5% across the rest of the S&P 500. All things considered, 2024 looks like a year of slowing GDP growth, single-digit earnings growth and single-digit returns on the median S&P 500 stock.”\n\nOn a global scale, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) January 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) report also contains revisions regarding the IMF’s October 2023 predictions and states that the global growth is expected to be 3.1% in 2024, up 0.2% from the IMF's October predictions. The IMF predicts a 3.2% growth in 2025. Furthermore, it is believed that global headline inflation is expected to fall by 5.8% in the current year and 4.4% in 2025.\n\nIn this economic environment and volatility, millions of American families would wonder how they could help their children and grandchildren secure their financial future. One of the best ways to do that would be to teach them money management. According to the Wall Street legend, Warren Buffett, sometimes parents start teaching financial literacy to their children later than they should. He said:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Whether it’s teaching kids the value of a dollar, the difference between needs and wants or the value of saving — these are all concepts that kids encounter at a very early age, so it’s best to help them to understand it.”\n\nBuying stocks for your children or grandchildren is also a good way to secure their financial future. Value stocks are some of the best options when looking at long-term investments. They are stocks of companies that are considered to be undervalued compared to their intrinsic value or potential for growth. Value stocks have also been endorsed by Wharton School Professor of Finance Jeremy Siegel for the current year. In a CNBC interview, he mentioned the abnormal gap between the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the Russell 1000 Growth and Russell 1000 Value. Based on that, he predicts a 15% gain in value stocks in 2024. Additionally, the best stocks to buy for grandchildren could include stocks with healthy long-term dividends.

Lilly’s stock continued to outperform driven by strong sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises, particularly after Novo Nordisk released its SELECT trial results showing a 20% relative risk reduction in overweight patients with cardiovascular disease and no prior history of diabetes.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells medicines in the categories of diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology, among other areas. Stock performance was strong due to strong third quarter sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises. We continue to think Lilly is well positioned to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.\n\nWe own Eli Lilly and Company, which we believe will remain a leader in the GLP-1 medicine class with Mounjaro, Zepbound, and the company’s deep pipeline of next generation GLP-1 medicines.”\n\n7.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is constantly gaining traction among sports clients on the back of its robust cloud services portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest extended multi-year partnership between Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its existing client, Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL), which is responsible for is responsible for the entire operating business of the Ligaverband, including the Bundesliga and Bundesliga leagues.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration is about driving innovation across Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2. As part of this, AWS becomes the official generative AI provider for DFL and also remains the official technology provider for the latter.\r\n\r\nDFL strives to deliver enhanced fan experience and boost media production. It also intends to automate the recognition of match events by leveraging AWS’ data services and applying a statistics portfolio.\r\n\r\nAWS’ robust generative AI capabilities and large language models will help DFL in creating real-time match commentary in written form and in multiple languages.\r\n\r\nSince 2020, DFL has been experiencing successful execution of various projects with the help of AWS, including Bundesliga Match Facts, which is powered by AWS.\r\n\r\nThe latest move by DFL highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’s innovative cloud products and services.\n\nCustomer Base Expansion\n\nThe latest move of DFL has added strength to AWS’ customer base. It also highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS’ innovative cloud products and services. Its concerted efforts toward bolstering its service offerings are likely to continue driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nRecently, NTT DOCOMO selected AWS and intends to leverage the latter’s robust infrastructure and cloud services to deploy its nationwide 5G Open Radio Access Network in Japan.\r\n\r\nOwkin also selected AWS as the primary cloud provider. Owkin intends to develop generative AI applications and accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials with the help of AWS’s scalable storage options, enhanced data security measures and strong computing capabilities.\r\n\r\nChoice Hotels International CHH went all-in on AWS. It closed its last data center and shifted its entire system infrastructure to AWS. Choice Hotels strives to update its hotel-facing operations and management tools seamlessly to enable its franchisees to have up-to-the-minute access to the latest innovations.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’ expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In fourth-quarter 2023, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of the total sales), which grew 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS, which has become an integral part of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo Conclude\n\nWe believe that AWS’ growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nNotably, Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues), up 25.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2023.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon.com belongs, has gained 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon.com is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +40.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Amazon.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Amazon.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $641.36 billion and $715.6 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon.com reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon.com is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $500 and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Stocks known as the Magnificent Seven -- a reference to the 1960 Western -- have helped the S&P 500 recover from its bear market low and roar into bull territory. These industry leaders all are involved in technology in some way, and each one also offers investors exposure to the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). These players are doing some or all of the following: developing AI, using it to improve their own operations, and selling AI tools to customers.\n\nYou don't have to buy every Magnificent Seven stock to benefit though. By scooping up shares of just a couple of these players, you can gain access to a company that already has proven its ability to grow earnings over time and has what it takes to win in a potential AI revolution. In even more good news, you don't need a fortune to invest in these promising AI stocks. In fact, with less than $500, you can buy two top Magnificent Seven AI stocks -- ones you'll want to hold onto for the long term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a giant in two high-growth areas -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- that have helped the company bring in billions of dollars in earnings in recent years. The company's dominance in these markets is set to continue as it's invested in key areas to support growth.\n\nFor example, in e-commerce, Amazon recently reached its fastest delivery times ever and aims to get even speedier. And in cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has invested heavily in technology infrastructure and expanded its offerings.\n\nAll of that sounds good, but Amazon's focus on AI makes the picture even brighter. The company is using this technology across its e-commerce business to streamline operations and better serve customers. This should result in cost savings and keep shoppers coming back -- and that is set to boost earnings over time.\n\nAnd AWS is bringing a vast menu of AI products and services to its customers, from access to top chips to power platforms to a fully managed service that lets them customize already existing large language models. These efforts also should lift earnings over the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has a track record of growth in return on invested capital (ROIC) over time, showing the company has made wise investment decisions. So, there's reason to believe this trend could continue. AMZN Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nAMZN Return on Invested Capital data by YCharts\n\nAnd you can get in on this story for about 42x times forward earnings estimates, a deal considering Amazon's strength in both e-commerce and cloud, and its long-term AI prospects.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another leader in its field. The company is parent of search engine Google, which consistently holds more than 90% of the global search market. And it's very likely Google will hold onto its position well into the future.\n\nWhy? Because it's become part of most people's routines and even entered our vocabulary: If you don't know the answer to a question, you \"Google it.\" So as long as Google continues generating good search results, it should stay ahead.\n\nBut Alphabet is doing something to truly ensure the quality of its searches and therefore hang onto its market share. The company is investing in AI. Alphabet's Search Generative Experience, available in certain countries, already is speeding up searches and offering a broader range of links and answers to questions.\n\nStaying ahead in search is crucial for Alphabet since the company makes most of its revenue from advertising on the Google Search platform. If advertisers continue to see that most people favor Google, they'll continue spending their ad dollars there -- and if AI makes Google Search even better, advertisers might even increase their Google ad spending.\n\nBut Alphabet isn't stopping there. The company recently announced its most powerful AI model ever, Gemini, and is applying it across its products and services. This tech powerhouse may be a smaller player than Amazon in cloud services, but Google Cloud is posting strong growth -- with double-digit gains in the most recent quarter. And its offering of AI tools could keep that solid pace of growth going.\n\nAll of this means Alphabet looks dirt cheap at 22x times forward earnings estimates and could be a winning AI stock for you over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Super Micro Computer: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "It's been three decades since there's been a next-big-thing investment trend that's captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Just as the advent of the internet changed the course of corporate America 30 years ago, there's a growing belief that AI can lead to that next leap in economic growth and innovation.\n\nThe wide-ranging potential for AI to transform virtually every sector and industry isn't lost on Wall Street or its top-tier investors. When examined as a whole, billionaire investors have piled into AI stocks, with many of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers not wanting to miss the boat. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFollowing monumental gains, Super Micro Computer has found itself on the chopping block\n\nOne company that's undeniably benefited from the sky-high expectations Wall Street has set for the AI revolution is server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of Super Micro ended March 19 higher by 220% on a year-to-date basis, and 853% on a trailing-12-month basis, all thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nWhereas a lot of investors are focused on the gamut of generative AI solutions being offered by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" it's the AI infrastructure companies -- those providing the physical backbone that allow AI-accelerated data centers to do their thing -- which have really thrived. Super Micro Computer provides the customizable rack servers businesses are using in their high-compute data centers.\n\nSuper Micro also has intricate ties to AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's high-end servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become nothing short of the standard in data centers geared at generative AI solutions.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the idea that Super Micro Computer is going to be an outperformer. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter, three billionaire investors were active sellers of Super Micro stock, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 255,383 shares sold Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors: 144,833 shares sold Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 93,827 shares sold\n\nWhile relying on Nvidia's high-powered GPUs has given Super Micro Computer stock an undeniable associated boost, it also means the company is constrained by Nvidia's supply shortage of its top chips.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro has a history of failing to meet lofty expectations. The company's customizable servers were expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread during the initial cloud boom. Unfortunately, demand failed to meet the lofty expectations set by Wall Street and investors. AI may represent another instance of a next-big-thing trend enduring a bubble prior to its maturation.\n\nBut while these three billionaires were dumping shares of Super Micro Computer, they were collectively piling into shares of six other AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSteven Cohen adds time-tested, bubble-resistant AI stocks\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen and his investment team haven't been shy about paring down their stakes in outperforming AI stocks. While positions in Nvidia and Super Micro were significantly reduced during the fourth quarter, Cohen and his aides added to two time-tested AI stocks:\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 462,179 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL): 670,677 shares purchased\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's most-dominant e-commerce marketplace. But the bread-and-butter operating segment that generates the lion's share of Amazon's cash flow and operating income is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is giving AWS customers access to a variety of generative AI solutions that can help them tailor their message to customers, as well as improve customer interactions. Given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its somewhat early stages, AWS has the potential to deliver sustained double-digit sales growth throughout the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nSelling Super Micro Computer and purchasing shares of rival Dell Technologies is another interesting move. Dell has a highly profitable personal-computing segment to fall back on if AI-server demand were to taper. Though Super Micro offers the superior short-term growth rate, Dell appears to be a smarter investment for those who want AI server exposure without stomach-churning share price volatility.\n\nKen Griffin piles into the infrastructure backbones of the AI movement\n\nA second billionaire money manager that wasn't shy about kicking Super Micro Computer to curb during the December-ended quarter is Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors. Despite dumping 56% of its stake in Super Micro, Citadel absolutely piled into the infrastructure backbones of the AI revolution:\n\nNvidia: 1,579,153 shares purchased Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD): 3,506,881 shares purchased\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. As long as demand continues to outpace the supply of its high-powered chips, Nvidia should have no trouble commanding a high price for its superior product.\n\nAt the same time, I've pointed out no shortage of reasons Nvidia could be the bubble of the century. Aside from history not being in its favor, the biggest concern for Nvidia might be that its top four customers, which account for 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. It's pretty clear that these businesses want to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace this AI titan in their data centers altogether.\n\nGriffin's fund also gobbled up shares of Nvidia rival AMD. Last June, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100. Though AMD began the rollout of this core AI product to a small group of customers last year, a sizable ramp in production and deliveries is expected this year.\n\nDon't forget that AMD has also been chiseling away central processing unit (CPU) market share from Intel. Though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same rate as GPUs, AMD's foundational CPU business could help insulate the company far more than Nvidia if the AI bubble were to pop.\n\nIsrael Englander opts for a couple Magnificent Seven components\n\nThe final big seller of Super Micro Computer stock during the fourth quarter was billionaire Israel Englander at Millennium Management. Englander and his team jettisoned 82% of their previous stake in Super Micro in favor of two Magnificent Seven constituents:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased\n\nBuying big into Wall Street's most influential stocks represents a relatively safe way to take advantage of AI growth while protect yourself in the event that AI uptake fails to meet sky-high expectations.\n\nAlphabet's foundation continues to be its internet search engine Google. In February, Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share. It's practically a monopoly that isn't going to be unseated anytime soon. This gives the company incredible ad-pricing power and generates abundant operating cash flow in most economic climates.\n\nBut Google Cloud might be Alphabet's most-promising growth segment. This now-profitable platform has earned a 10% global share of cloud infrastructure spend. Allowing its customers access to generative AI within Google Cloud can open new revenue streams for Alphabet.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has been actively incorporating AI solutions in its physical products for years. A perfect example being the fine-tuning associated with autocorrect and predictive text for iPhones. Apple is very much reliant on AI advancement to fuel sales of its beloved physical products.\n\nHowever, Apple's biggest long-term growth driver is likely its shift to subscription services. Although it's not abandoning the physical products that endeared users to its brand, Apple is complementing its revenue stream by becoming a platforms company. This move should be positive for its operating margin, as well as encourage users to stay within the umbrella of Apple's product and service ecosystem.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Investing in stocks can be tricky, as the market's past performance doesn't always indicate what's to come. However, knowledge is power, and noticing past patterns can help ensure you're ready to strike if history decides to repeat itself. As a result, it can only help investors to know that history suggests the Nasdaq Composite could surge in 2024.\n\nSince the index launched in 1971, it has risen by an average of 19% in each year that followed a market recovery of the magnitude seen in 2023. Consequently, it's not a bad idea to consider investing in the companies fueling the bulk of the Nasdaq Composite's growth.\n\nThe phrase \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined last year to describe the seven most prominent tech companies, which include Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. These companies rule tech, and many were key players in the market's stellar recovery last year.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven could be an excellent place to invest and profit from a potential surge in the Nasdaq composite in 2024. So, here are two Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of Nvidia's meteoric rise last year. Its stock soared by 239% in 2023 as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for artificial intelligence (AI) developers everywhere. These high-powered parallel-processing chips are crucial for training and powering AI models, with increased demand causing Nvidia's earnings to skyrocket.\n\nThe company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips while rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up on the technology front.\n\nIn Nvidia's most recent quarter (the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition in the AI chip space is expected to heat up this year, with AMD and Intel bringing powerful new hardware to market. However, in addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion.\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain market supremacy. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nThe table above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit close to $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 yields a stock price of about $1,300.\n\nConsidering the company's current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 44% over the next two fiscal years. Given its prominent position in AI, Nvidia is a Magnificent Seven stock that's too good to pass up.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out in Seattle almost 30 years ago. The tech giant has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nBut all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site. It announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion. A solid recovery in its e-commerce earnings over the last year has seen Amazon's free cash flow soar 904% to over $32 billion, indicating the company has the funds to continue investing in its business and overcome possible headwinds.  Data by YCharts\n\nThe chart above indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by its forward P/E of 43, you get a stock price of $300.\n\nThis projection would see Amazon's stock rise 68% from its current value over the next two fiscal years. As a result, the company is worth considering before its share price surges.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "22 Best Online Side Hustles for College Students",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 22 best online side hustles for college students. We have also discussed the growth of side jobs in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Online Side Hustles for College Students.\n\nIn a 2022 Zapier survey of 2,032 US adults, it was found that side hustles are booming, with 36% of Gen Xers, 59% of Gen Zers, and 61% of millennials engaging in them. Gen Zers, in particular, rake in an average of $9,537 annually from their side gigs. For college students struggling with rising expenses, side hustles offer a viable solution to bolster their finances during their undergraduate years.\n\nAccording to M’Chelle Ryan, director of Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) Academy, the flexibility of freelancing is especially appealing to college students, as it allows control over hours, schedule, and skill sets. With students increasingly seeking higher-paying opportunities in the gig economy, side hustles have become a favored avenue for financial independence and exploration.\n\nOne of the most popular platforms for pursuing side hustles for college students is Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR), especially for freelance writing. From crafting Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)  product descriptions to ghostwriting memoirs, writers can capitalized on their talents to attract clients.\n\nRafael Meneses, for instance, surpassed his regular salary through Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) by offering unlimited revisions and refunds. There are also examples of individual who after incorporation of personal photos and descriptions into their profiles led to making $8,000 in one month alone.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that in February 2020, Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) celebrated a milestone, with freelancers collectively earning $1 billion since its inception. By the following year, this figure doubled to $2 billion, reflecting the platform's growing significance amid pandemic uncertainties.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Gen Xers have been popular for pursuing side hustles, the latest data from the Labor Department revealed a notable increase in Americans holding multiple jobs, reaching its highest level since the pandemic onset. In October, nearly 8.4 million individuals juggled two or more positions, constituting 5.2% of the workforce, a figure not seen since January 2020. The statistics delineate a disparity between genders, with 5.9% of women and 4.7% of men engaged in multiple employments.\n\nExperts speculate on the driving forces behind this trend, attributing it to the economic repercussions of inflation and the anticipation of potential layoffs. Inflation, escalating at rates of 4.7% in 2021, 8% in 2022, and 3.5% in 2023, has strained budgets, particularly for those with lower incomes.\n\nThe shift towards remote work spurred by the pandemic has also played a key role in the proliferation of multiple-job holders. The flexibility and autonomy afforded by telecommuting have enabled employees to seamlessly accommodate additional employment opportunities. Elizabeth Renter, a data analyst at NerdWallet, highlights the impact of remote work in facilitating the uptake of second jobs, particularly among those with 'remote' occupations. This phenomenon confirms a broader return to pre-pandemic labor dynamics, marked by a resurgence in seasonal employment patterns and a growing reliance on remote work arrangements. 22 Best Online Side Hustles for College Students\n\nA student concentrate on their laptop in the library, taking advantage of an educational program online.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best online side hustles for college students, we identified jobs which offered low barriers to entry, remote work flexibility and a high earning potential. We gauged the presence of these factors through Reddit threads and discussions about these jobs. Thus, consensus based approach was used to scoring each job out of a total of 30. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n22. Participation in Online Surveys\n\nIM Score: 7\n\nPaid online surveys offer college students a convenient side hustle. You can earn up to $40 monthly with Survey Junkie, potentially making $365 to $1,825 annually with Swagbucks. Branded Surveys suggests honesty and consistent effort, with most surveys paying $1 to $3 each. While not a full-time income, it's flexible and requires no financial investment.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the oldest stock market index, and one in which the highest quality companies invest.\n\nAlthough investors sometimes regard the Dow as a boring index, plenty of stocks brim with excitement. Remember, the boring trait is valuable during corrections due to the defensive qualities of its blue-chip stocks. Also, some of these defensive companies can be the best innovators.\n\nToday, several companies on the Dow offer a combination of defense and growth. First, they are defensive due to their stable earnings and robust balance sheets. Second, they offer growth from participating in secular tailwinds like artificial intelligence and digital payments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese strengths land these favorite Dow stocks among Wall Street analysts’ top picks. Analysts rate these three stocks buy or better and expect further upside. They are solid additions to any portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a bellwether that dominates several industries. First, it’s an e-commerce leader and the top cloud service provider by market share through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Its dominance extends beyond these two areas to freight and logistics, advertising and entertainment.\n\nSeveral secular tailwinds explain the reason it’s one of the favorite Dow stocks among analysts. First, the shift in shopping has moved from physical retail stores to online commerce. According to Boston Consulting Group, global online retail will grow 9% annually through 2027. As a result, e-commerce will account for 41% of global retail sales by 2027 from 18% in 2017.\n\nAnother major growth driver for Amazon is artificial intelligence (AI). First, AWS offers the most expansive compute instances for training and inference. Second, it provides Bedrock, a managed service with several high-performing foundation models that enable companies to build and scale AI applications. Third, the company is building generative AI applications for customer subscriptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nInevitably, e-commerce growth and artificial intelligence will power AMZN stock higher. Wall Street optimistically agrees, as reflected by 51 buy and 7 overweight ratings. Analysts expect a substantial upside with an average price target of $207.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The logo for Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is shown on a phone screen in front of the Microsoft logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBesides Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), no other company has capitalized more on the AI trend than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In February 2023, CEO Satya Nadella stirred excitement when he stated that they would make Google dance. It was a warning shot that Bing, powered by AI, would attempt to challenge Google Search.\n\nAlthough the search threat hasn’t panned out, the tech giant is leading AI innovation. First, Azure AI has become the preferred cloud infrastructure provider for building, training and deploying AI models and applications. Notably, Microsoft Azure grew 30% year over year (YOY) last quarter compared to AWS’s 13% growth, highlighting its AI services advantage.\n\nSince Microsoft is also a productivity company, it has developed Copilot for most of its productivity applications. In September 2023, it launched Copilot powered by AI. Copilot simplifies tasks across Microsoft 365 applications like Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook and Teams. Notably, the company is already monetizing these services, charging $30 per user monthly.\n\nWith Microsoft positioned to benefit from AI, it has become one of the favorite Dow stocks to buy. The tech giant is already showing tangible AI benefits in its earnings. Unsurprisingly, the stock is near all-time highs and analysts expect an 11% upside.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAside from the AI trade, investors can consider other favorite Dow stocks. A great option is Visa (NYSE:V), which will continue to benefit from the shift from cash to digital payments. The company provides payment rails that facilitate most credit card and mobile wallet payments.\n\nAs the largest open credit card network, Visa competes against peers Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and China-based Union Pay. It’s worth noting that Visa doesn’t extend credit. Instead, it acts as a middleman between credit card issuers (financial institutions) and merchants, earning fees on each transaction.\n\nOver the years, doubters have forecasted Visa’s decline due to the emergence of fintech companies. Instead, the card network has only strengthened its stronghold in the payments ecosystem. Today, Visa has partnered with a majority of fintechs, such as Block (NYSE:SQ), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Remitly (NASDAQ:RELY).\n\nNotably, Visa’s greatest competition is cash. According to McKinsey, cash usage has declined rapidly, losing 20 percentage points of total global payments in the last five years. As payments shift to card and digital payments, room for growth enlarges.\n\nFinally, Visa is a payment tollbooth that benefits from network effects. Hence, it’s one of my favorite Dow stocks. The more users on its network, the more valuable it is to its merchants, which in turn enhances convenience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "25 Best Websites to Find Remote Jobs in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 best websites to find remote jobs in 2024. We also discussed the state of remote work in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Best Websites to Find Remote Jobs in 2024.\n\nRemote Work: Popular in 2024 or Not?\n\nRemote work saw a major increase during the pandemic, with the percentage of full workdays conducted remotely in the US soaring from about 6% to over 50% in the spring of 2020. However, since then, it has gradually declined, stabilizing at around 28% by early 2023. Despite some CEOs publicly advocating for a return to the office, a new survey reveals that executives anticipate remote work to continue expanding. This anticipation aligns with employee preferences and the continuous improvement of remote work technology. Notably, both hybrid and fully remote work arrangements are expected to increase over the next five years.\n\nHence, in 2023, we observed a notable increase in the adoption of flexible work arrangements among US companies, with the percentage offering flexibility rising from 51% to 62%. However, despite this positive trend, a major portion (38%) of employers still maintain a preference for in-person work, indicating that the debate surrounding flexible and remote work is far from resolved and is likely to continue into 2024.\n\nFor example, Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), the ubiquitous video conferencing platform, implemented a hybrid work model in 2023, requiring employees within 50 miles of company offices to return for two days per week. Despite Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM)’s integral role in facilitating remote work during the pandemic, the company believes a structured hybrid approach fosters better collaboration and innovation.\n\nWhile some may find irony in Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM)’s decision, the decision highlights the evolving nature of remote work policies post-pandemic. Capitalizing on its own platform, Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM) aims to maintain connectivity among dispersed teams while promoting in-person interaction for enhanced productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nForecasts for 2024 also suggest a potential increase in office occupancy as some CEOs advocate for return-to-office mandates, citing benefits such as enhanced collaboration. This stance, exemplified by companies like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which threatened termination for non-compliance, conflicts with the desires of many employees who value the flexibility remote work provides, potentially leading to labor shortages if not addressed effectively.\n\nDespite these threatening situation, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s remote work options persist despite recent controversies over return-to-office policies. As of October 2023, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s job site advertised over 500 full-time and 300 part-time roles, with some offering virtual or hybrid work arrangements. Despite mandates for in-office work, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) maintains a remote jobs page, allowing discussions on remote work during the interview process. Salaries for remote roles vary based on location and position. For instance, an Area Manager II in Ohio could earn $61,400 to $100,000 annually, while a Senior Project Manager's salary ranges from $121,000 to $235,200 per year. Operations Engineer roles offer $48,600 to $93,500 annually. Though Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) requires most corporate employees to work in-office three times weekly, some roles permit remote or hybrid work setups.\n\nDespite challenges and resistance, there is a growing recognition of the benefits of remote work among employees, with 63% indicating willingness to accept pay cuts for the advantages it offers. Consequently, there is an anticipated increase in the adoption of flexible work options by the end of 2024, driven by the need for talent retention and organizational growth. As the landscape continues to evolve, companies must adapt by fostering supportive environments, leveraging technologies like AI, and investing in training for managers to navigate the complexities of the changing work dynamics.\n\nHow to Find a Remote Job with No Experience?\n\nFinding a remote job with no experience requires a proactive approach and highlighting transferable skills. Start by identifying your strengths, such as communication, organization, or problem-solving abilities. Tailor your resume to showcase relevant experiences, even if they're from volunteer work, internships, or academic projects. Utilize online job boards, freelance platforms, and professional networking sites like LinkedIn to search for entry-level remote positions or internships. Consider gaining skills through online courses or certifications to bolster your qualifications. Networking with professionals in your desired field can also lead to job opportunities or valuable advice. Lastly, be persistent, patient, and open to starting with lower-paying or part-time positions to gain experience and build your remote career path. 25 Best Websites to Find Remote Jobs in 2024\n\nPhoto by Glenn Taubenfeld on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the best websites for find remote jobs in 2024, we relied on reviews for these individual websites on Reddit.

If you want to skip our coverage of the data center industry, which is one of the hottest in the world right now, then you can skip ahead to take a look at the 5 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were expecting at the start of the fourth quarter of 2021. Back then, the Federal Reserve had yet to start to raise interest rates, even though some voices on Wall Street were raising alarm bells about the effects of the monetary policy and stimulus packages in the era of COVID-19 lock downs. High rates naturally do not bode well for high growth sectors, and technology stocks big and small had a rough time on the market the next year particularly as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global food and energy markets and spurred multi year high inflation levels which made some question whether consecutive 75 basis point hikes by the Federal Reserve were still a bit low.\n\nNow, with the first quarter of 2024 coming to an end, the stock market is a fundamentally changed environment due to the rise of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA has shown to be the hottest artificial intelligence stock on Wall Street, and at its heart is the multi-billion global data center industry. While most people experience the user side of AI, at its heart, the technology is part of a broader set of data analysis techniques such as machine learning.\n\nWhether it's AI or ML, both require copious amounts of data to spearhead leading edge applications in high technology industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Processing and storing this data requires considerable data center facilities, which are large scale computing houses that 'host' equipment such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and storage modules.\n\nA variety of firms cater to the needs of the global data center industry. Some of the best known in this area are data center hardware manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). On the software side, firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) provide businesses with software environments to generate meaningful insights from their data.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, to analyze the performance of data center stocks, one can either see how individual firms such as the equities listed above are performing or track a collection of stocks called an exchange traded fund (ETF). Most popular data center ETFs also include real estate investment trusts (ETFs) due to the sizeable real estate requirements of operating and owning data centers. One such ETF is the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF. Its six month, 12 month, and 36 month year returns sit at 14.5%, 22.27%, and 2.10%, respectively. As expected, the ETF's annual returns in 2022 were negative, as the broader technology sector took a beating.\n\nFinally, one stock that helps keep track of the broader data center industry might be faring is Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR). Here's what Baron Funds had to say about this particular stock in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nFollowing strong share performance, we trimmed our large investment in data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for the company.\n\nData center landlords such as Digital Realty (and Equinix, Inc.) are benefiting from record low vacancy, demand outpacing supply, more constrained power availability, and rising rental rates. Several secular demand vectors, which are currently broadening, are contributing to robust fundamentals for data center space globally. They include the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, increased cloud computing adoption, the ongoing growth in mobile data and internet traffic, and artificial intelligence as a new wave of data center demand.\n\nIn the last few months, we have also spent time with CEO Andy Power of Digital Realty. Over the last few years, Andy and Digital Realty’s management team have been undergoing a business transformation, which accelerated after its acquisition of Interxion in March 2020, a pure-play European network-dense data center operator. The company has been shedding non-core slower-growth assets, investing and expanding in Europe, growing its retail colocation business, improving its balance sheet, and adding operational expertise by supplementing new management leadership. We have spent a significant amount of time with Andy over the years and believe the investments the company has made are on the cusp of bearing fruit and will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, we believe the fundamentals in its core business are at an inflection point with robust demand/bookings, pricing power, hyperscale cloud players outsourcing a higher percentage of their digital infrastructure needs and limited competitive capacity. We believe these factors will lead to growth in the core business in the next few years and are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the company.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some undervalued and best data center stocks according to analysts. A couple that top the list are VNET Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET), IHS Holding Limited (NYSE:IHS), and Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD). 12 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nThe silhouette of a data center facility in the sunset, illustrating the companies focus on data center solutions.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best data center stocks according to analysts, we ranked the data center related constituents of the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF by the average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked those with the highest upside.\n\nFor these undervalued data center stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the top 12 stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio. To skip the details on Soros’ life, investment philosophy, and his fund’s latest bets, go directly to the Top 5 Stocks in George Soros' Stock Portfolio.\n\nBillionaire George Soros is one of the most famous hedge fund managers in the world, primarily known for shorting $10 billion worth of British pounds on September 16, 1992, a day known as “Black Wednesday.\" This trade made Soros $1 billion in profit in a single day as the currency declined against the German mark and US dollar by 15% and 25%, respectively. After this event, he has been known as \"the man who broke the Bank of England.\"\n\nWhile Black Wednesday was the event that made George Soros a huge celebrity, it wasn't his only successful foreign exchange bet. His global macro-investing strategies have made billions for him and his firm. He made $1 billion from Thailand's financial crisis in 1997, and in 2013, he made big bucks by betting against the Japanese yen.\n\nLike all successful investors, Soros also faced some setbacks in his life. One such example would be his investments in Russian bonds in 1998. When the Russian financial crisis deepened, Russia defaulted on its debt obligations, including its government bonds. His firm lost $2 billion on the investment. However, this loss was just a small hurdle in his career and an insignificant event compared to his overall performance. He has still proven himself as one of the most successful people in the world of finance despite his few failures.\n\nSoros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970, which was formerly a hedge fund and is now a family office since 2011. He retired from all his responsibilities in June 2023 and handed them over to his son. As of February 28, George Soros has a net worth of $6.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nSoros is also known as one of the greatest philanthropists. He has donated $32 billion to philanthropic causes. In 1993, he founded Open Society Foundations, which focuses on causes such as justice, education, public health, and independent media.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment Philosophy\n\nSoros's investment strategies combined scientific analysis, such as his application of economic theories like reflexivity, with an understanding of market dynamics and human behavior. This approach allowed him to achieve significant success as an investor. His reflexivity theory suggests that the perceptions and actions of individuals can influence and even distort the reality they perceive. The theory suggests that our beliefs about the world can shape the way the world works. In financial markets, it suggests that investors' beliefs about the value of assets can affect the actual value of those assets, leading to bubbles or crashes.\n\nIn his book, The Alchemy of Finance, Soros said:\n\n“The fact that a thesis is flawed does not mean that we should not invest in it as long as other people believe in it and there is a large group of people left to be convinced. The point was made by John Maynard Keynes when he compared the stock market to a beauty contest where the winner is not the most beautiful contestant but the one whom the greatest number of people consider beautiful. Where I have something significant to add is in pointing out that it pays to look for the flaws; if we find them, we are ahead of the game because we can limit our losses when the market also discovers what we already know. It is when we are unaware of what could go wrong that we have to worry.”\n\nGeorge Soros' reflexivity theory made him a contrarian investor. He is known for his ability to identify undervalued assets and invest in them when others are selling. Between 1970 and 2000, Soros had an average annual returns of 30%, which makes him one of the most successful portfolio managers in the world.\n\nSoros Fund Management Q4 Bets\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio value increased from $7.05 billion to $7.65 billion. The fund made 75 new purchases, including Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Avantor, Inc. (NYSE:AVTR). The firm increased its holdings in 75 stocks, including a 482% increase in Sempra (NYSE:SRE) and 237% in Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX). Sempra is also among the stocks in our list of the Best Stocks to Buy Before US Election Season 2024.\n\nIn addition, Soros Fund decreased its holdings in 41 stocks and completely closed out 75 positions. Some of the top stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio include Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Top 5 Stocks in George Soros' Stock Portfolio\n\nGeorge Soros of Soros Fund Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scanned Soros Fund Management’s Q4 2023 portfolio and picked its top 12 stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nTop 12 Stocks in George Soros' Stock Portfolio\n\n12. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is a Dublin-based company engaged in providing management and technology consulting services and solutions.\n\nOn February 20, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) reported that it is planning to acquire GemSeek. The company would expand its offerings, including customer analytics and AI capabilities through this acquisition.\n\nAccenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the top stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio, along with Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK), AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nClearBridge Investments stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a California-based company that provides freight transport, ride-hailing services, food delivery, and more.\n\nOn February 20, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced that Uber Eats is expanding its autonomous operations internationally to Japan by the end of next month. The company, in partnership with Mitsubishi Electric and Cartken, will deliver food through the use of autonomous robots in some parts of Tokyo.\n\nOn February 14, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced its first-ever share repurchase program through which the company will buy back its common stock of up to $7 billion.\n\nRiverPark Advisors mentioned Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”\n\n10. Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J)\n\nJacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) is a Texas-based company that offers technical professional services, including but not limited to construction services and scientific and specialty consulting.\n\nOn February 15, Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) announced that it was chosen as the lead design consultant by Rua Al Madinah Holding Company for a big urban development project in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn January 25, Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) increased its quarterly dividend by 11.5% to $0.29, payable by March 22 to the shareholders of record on February 23. As of the February 28 market close, the stock’s dividend yield was 0.79%.\n\nMadison Investments commented on Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Jacobs Solutions Inc. (NYSE:J) was down after missing earnings expectations and providing 2024 guidance below expectations. While revenue growth remains strong with high single digit growth, costs were higher than expected mostly related to the carrying cost of the upcoming spin of its government services business. We estimate that post the spin, Jacobs will have a higher growth rate and higher margin profile with an improved balance sheet.”\n\n9. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a Connecticut-based company that offers online travel and related services.\n\nOn February 22, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) initiated its quarterly dividend of $8.75, payable by March 28 to the shareholders of record on March 8. The stock’s dividend yield was 1.001% as of the February 28 market close.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported a non-GAAP EPS of $32.00, which beat the estimates by $1.95. The revenue increased by 18.0% year-over-year (YoY) to $4.78 billion, surpassing the estimates by $70 million.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n8. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a Washington-based company that focuses on e-commerce, AI, cloud computing, online advertising, and more. The company grabs the eighth spot on our list of top stocks in George Soros’ stock portfolio.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds, hedge fund sentiment was positive toward Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Q4 as the number of hedge funds with investments in the stock was 293, up from 286 in the previous quarter.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that its cloud computing unit plans on making an investment worth $5 billion in Mexico for cloud infrastructure projects over the next 15 years.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was mentioned in Polen Capital’s fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which saw significant price appreciation throughout much of 2023, saw its share price increase materially in Q4 following the company’s Q3 2023 earnings report. We have yet to see the long-awaited re-acceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth. However, in our estimation, the segment’s growth has likely bottomed, and we could see accelerating growth in 2024. Further, Amazon’s e-commerce business has gradually re-accelerated from 2022’s levels and, perhaps most importantly, the company’s margins and free cash flow have rebounded materially from last year. This rebound in margins and free cash flow at Amazon has been a key component of our long-term thesis for the business, and we expect the improvement in these metrics to continue into 2024 and beyond (though perhaps not linearly) as the company continues to optimize costs and capital expenditures. Our position in Amazon reflects our positive long-term expectations of the business, and it is currently our largest absolute weight in the Portfolio.”\n\n7.

The revenue of $1.06 billion grew 62.5% YoY.\n\nFirst Pacific Advisors made the following comment about American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (NYSE:AEL) is a leading writer of fixed-index annuities. The company is undergoing an ambitious transformation plan, led by CEO Anant Bhalla, to diversify into alternatives and move assets off balance sheet, creating a fee income stream and freeing up-capital for buybacks (a program they refer to as AEL 2.0). As of 23Q2, AEL had 25% of its balance sheet in private assets. The company has had several takeover offers over the years and on June 27, 2023 Brookfield bid $55 per share for the business.”\n\n6.

        "title": "Here's My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock for Long-Term Investors to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have dominated investing headlines recently, as this exclusive group of megacap companies are in a league of their own and have mostly delivered strong performance recently.\n\nWhile Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has certainly been the most exciting Magnificent Seven stock to watch so far in 2024, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been in a two-way race for the title of the largest market cap in the U.S. stock market, I wouldn't be surprised if the best performer in the Magnificent Seven over the next five to 10 years was Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nThe two sides of Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, and for good reason. In addition to the Google Search business, which is dominant in its industry, Google also has Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and the Android mobile operating system, just to name a few. These collectively are known as the Google Services business. In fact, I've used four different Google products in the process of writing this article. This is a massive business that generates a ton of reliable, high-margin income.\n\nThe other main part of the business is Google Cloud, which is a cloud infrastructure provider that competes with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. It has the number three market share right now but is growing fast.\n\nAlphabet could be a big long-term winner\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money from ad sales, especially on the Google Services side of the business, and there could be more potential for growth here than it seems. Thanks to evolving AI technology, Alphabet is continually getting better at targeting ads more effectively, which inherently makes them more valuable. Plus, while there is certainly limited growth potential in its search business, that's not the case for some of Alphabet's other ad-driven platforms, such as YouTube.\n\nGoogle Cloud is definitely the more interesting part of the business from a growth perspective. It makes up less than 11% of the company's total revenue today, but is also the fastest growing part of Alphabet, with 26% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. In fact, as recently as 2018, Google Cloud made up just over 4% of the company's total sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could just be the starting point. The cloud computing market is estimated to be $676 billion in size today but is expected to roughly quadruple to $2.3 trillion by 2032. If Google Cloud can simply maintain its market share, this could be a big growth driver, but recent data indicates that Google Cloud is gaining on the market leaders.\n\nTremendous profitability and a reasonable valuation\n\nIt's also worth noting that Alphabet has about $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which combined with the more than $80 billion in annualized net income it generated in the most recent quarter gives it tremendous financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they arise.\n\nWith a valuation of about 22 times forward earnings, I wouldn't exactly call Alphabet a cheap stock, although it is easily the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven by this metric. However, it does seem attractively valued for a market-leading and highly profitable business growing revenue at a double-digit rate. Alphabet is a rare combination of a dominant core business and a rapidly growing secondary business with massive, long-tailed growth potential. And while it isn't the largest stock in the Magnificent Seven today, I wouldn't be at all shocked for that to change within the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Forget Costco: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Retail is one of the best markets for long-term investment, known for its consistent growth. The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. In fact, the global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST) has enjoyed immense success, with its shares up 213% since 2019. The company's wholesale business model has won over consumers in more than a dozen countries and has an exciting outlook as it continues to expand.\n\nHowever, it's hard to consider Costco's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) also exist. These companies lead their respective areas of retail and hold the first and third biggest market shares in e-commerce. AAPL Chart\n\nThis chart shows that Amazon and Apple have significantly outperformed Costco's stock over the last decade, suggesting they could be better long-term buys. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple are investing heavily in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI), which could keep them on their current growth trajectories.\n\nSo, forget Costco and buy these unstoppable stocks instead.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOne of the best reasons to invest in Amazon is its proven reliability under strain.\n\nAn economic downturn in 2022 caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% during the year. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company has made an impressive recovery, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.\n\nA range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and has seen its free cash flow skyrocket 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Investors who sold the company's stock in 2022 will not have benefited from its significant growth since then. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows that Amazon's earnings could hit about $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Costco's may achieve $19 per share. On the surface, it looks like Costco is the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 43 and Costco's 47) yields stock prices of $296 for Amazon and $902 for Costco.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections will see Amazon's stock rise 66% and Costco's 21% by fiscal 2026. Alongside a lucrative e-commerce business and growing prospects in AI, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer right now.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is a behemoth in consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, the company holds the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S., only after Amazon and Walmart, despite having a significantly smaller range of products.\n\nThe popularity of Apple's offerings has instilled reliability in its business and given it the funds to overcome unexpected headwinds. Apple's free cash flow hit $107 billion last year, significantly higher than Costco's $6 billion. Apple's free cash flow actually increased 10% in 2023 despite hits to its revenue, allowing the company to continue investing in its business.\n\nApple has hit some roadblocks over the last year as it had to contend with reductions in consumer spending, restrictions on its products in China, and issues with Apple Watch patents. However, the company's outlook remains strong, with considerable cash reserves and expansions into lucrative sectors like AI and virtual reality. COST PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe table above shows that Apple's stock is a bargain compared to Costco's shares. Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow are considerably less than Costco's, indicating Apple is trading at a far better value.\n\nThese are two helpful valuation metrics. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAs a result, Apple's stock is worth considering right now, especially over Costco.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "The S&P 500 index has roared higher over the past 16 months, rebounding from its bear market low to reach record levels -- and confirm a new bull market. And the movement has been led by one group of stocks in particular. Dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" in reference to the 1960 Western, these players are technology stocks, and each one is a leader in its specialty area.\n\nSome investors may worry that after these gains, it's too late to get in on these stock market stars. The concern is they may have become too expensive and are ready to stagnate or fall. But a stock with spectacular momentum still could have plenty of room to run if the company has strong long-term prospects. And that's the case of some of today's top-performing stocks. Let's check out two Magnificent Seven companies to buy hand over fist right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) sells the world's top-performing artificial intelligence (AI) chip, the H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) that powers crucial operations such as the training and inference of AI models. This has helped Nvidia's revenue and net income soar in the triple digits in recent times and reach record levels. And it's also helped the shares to soar more than 240% over the past year.\n\nOf course, rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel exist in this market, but so far Nvidia has shown it has what it takes to stay ahead. And at the company's GTC AI Conference this week, chief executive officer Jensen Huang announced product launches and updates that offer us reason to be optimistic.\n\nOne particular bit of news was especially noteworthy, and that's the upcoming release of Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and chips. The platform, available later this year, will help customers run generative AI on large language models (LLMs) at a cost and energy consumption level 25 times lower than its predecessor.\n\nChief executive officers of the biggest tech companies from MetaPlatforms to Tesla commented on the Blackwell announcement -- showing that they're on board to use the platform. \"There is currently nothing better than NVIDIA hardware for AI,\" Tesla's Elon Musk said in Nvidia's Blackwell launch statement. And the biggest cloud companies said they're ready to make the technology available to customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this signals a new era of growth ahead for this chip giant, meaning that, trading at 36x times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia still looks like a buy today.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a great tech stock to buy now because it's already benefiting and is set to benefit from three growth areas: e-commerce, cloud computing, and AI. The company is a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing services, and it's investing heavily in AI to boost earnings in both of those businesses.\n\nFirst, AI aside, Amazon has become an e-commerce giant and continues to build its position thanks to its Prime subscription service, offering members many benefits that keep them coming back. AI has the potential to lower Amazon's costs and improve the shopping experience for customers -- and that could translate into earnings growth. Amazon uses AI to streamline e-commerce operations, find the best delivery routes to shorten delivery times, and uses AI to help customers find the products they need. And these are just a few examples.\n\nThrough Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud business, Amazon offers a broad range of services to its customers, and these services include just about every aspect of AI: from chips to power the training of LLMs to a fully managed service that allows customers to customize top existing LLMs. Since AWS already is a cloud leader, chances are when its customers are interested in launching an AI project, they'll do that right there on AWS.\n\nSo, Amazon is using AI to improve its operations and save time and money -- and it's selling AI services to customers. And this means it could score a double victory in the area of AI.\n\nConsidering this and Amazon's long track record of earnings growth, the stock, trading for 42x times forward earnings estimates, looks like one to buy hand over fist today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is Up 77% Over the Past Year, but It Could Go Much Higher",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks control a disproportionate amount of the global technology sector. These seven stocks alone could cause massive swings in the overall market regardless of whatever the remaining thousands of stocks are doing. In fact, these seven stocks together account for a market cap of over $13 trillion, with six out of seven in the trillion-dollar bracket.\n\nE-commerce king Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is sporting a market capitalization of $1.8 trillion, and its stock is up 77% over the past year. At this level, can it still go higher?\n\nIs Amazon just getting started?\n\nAmazon already accounts for about 38% of all U.S. e-commerce, a breathtaking amount, and 31% of all cloud computing business, equally outstanding. So, you can't say it's just getting started, but considering the opportunity ahead, the growth runway still looks wide open.\n\nIn e-commerce, it recently renovated its logistics system from a national to a regional network. It keeps more of its higher-selling products in several warehouses throughout the country, making it easier, faster, and cheaper to get them to customers.\n\nIt seems like e-commerce growth possibilities are endless. E-commerce is expected to keep increasing as a percentage of overall retail sales, from 19.4% in 2023 to 22.6% in 2027, according to Statista. Amazon has a practically unbeatable moat in e-commerce. The faster it gets orders to customers, the more it pads that moat and will benefit from a continued shift to e-commerce.\n\nIn cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to forge new deals with high-profile customers like Amgen and Salesforce. CEO Andy Jassy said the cost-optimization that's been preventing customers from investing in their cloud program continues to \"attenuate\" and that AWS has a strong pipeline of new clients, as well as larger commitments for longer periods.\n\nIn some areas, Amazon really is just getting started. Its fastest-growing business right now is advertising, a recently launched segment. Sales were up 27% year over year in the fourth quarter. And it's just getting its feet wet with healthcare.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI is changing everything\n\nAmazon is an artificial intelligence (AI) superstar, and it's developed industry-leading tools and capabilities across the wide spectrum of its businesses.\n\nThat begins with AWS, where Amazon made waves last year with the announcement of a robust array of generative AI services for business clients. It continues to introduce and refine these tools, which allow developers and businesses to work faster and more efficiently.\n\nAI has always been an important element of the e-commerce business. Amazon can pinpoint what its customers are looking for based on their browsing habits and strong AI, driving higher conversions. It's also integral to advertising since advertisers get exposure to Amazon's hundreds of millions of customers exactly when they're already looking for what advertisers are selling.\n\nWhat's notable is that AWS and advertising are its high-margin businesses in comparison with e-commerce. As these businesses grow, they not only pad the top line but also increase the bottom line even more. Amazon's stock price historically correlates with operating income, which is its preferred bottom-line metric, and rising operating income should lead to a correspondingly higher price.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI had come.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector is up 51% year over year, fueled almost entirely by excitement over AI. And the market's potential suggests it's nowhere near hitting its ceiling.\n\nData from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit a valuation nearing $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. For reference, that trajectory will see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the decade's end.\n\nSo it's not too late to invest in this budding industry and profit from its development for years to come. Here are two AI stocks that could set you up for life.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has hit a few roadblocks in recent years. The company was responsible for more than 80% of the central processing unit (CPU) market for at least a decade and was the primary chip supplier for Apple's MacBook lineup for years. But Intel's dominance made it complacent, leaving the company vulnerable to more-innovative competitors.\n\nChip rival Advanced Micro Devices started gradually eating away at Intel's CPU market share in 2017, and that share is now down to 63%. Then, in 2020, Apple cut ties with Intel in favor of more powerful in-house hardware designs. As a result, Intel's stock is down about 34% over the last three years.\n\nHowever, the fall from grace seemed to light a fire under Intel again, and it is making moves to come back strong in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal-foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025.\n\nMoreover, Intel is investing heavily in AI. The company debuted a range of AI chips last December, including Gaudi3, a graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel has a mountain to climb to catch its rivals in AI. But it is on a promising path that could pay off in a major way over the long term. INTC EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe chart above indicates earnings could achieve nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. When you multiply that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30, you get a stock price of $90, projecting an increase of 120% by fiscal 2026.\n\nWith a promising shift in Intel's business model and growing prospects in AI, the stock is a screaming buy right now and could set you up for life.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nSince its founding almost 30 years ago, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has grown into a tech behemoth. It has expanded into the far reaches of the industry by becoming a leader in e-commerce and the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nBut all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. The platform launched Bedrock, a program that helps customers build generative AI applications. It also unveiled CodeWhisperer, capable of generating code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool that can transcribe patient-physician conversations.\n\nAmazon is even using AI to boost its retail site. It announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, AWS revenue rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. And it was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue among Amazon's three segments.\n\nThe tech giant is on a promising growth path, and estimates for earnings per share (EPS) seem to support its significant potential. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe chart above indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by its forward P/E of 42, you get a stock price of $294.\n\nThis would see Amazon's stock rise 67% from its current value over the next two fiscal years. With exciting prospects in AI, Amazon's stock is worth considering right now before it's too late.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here Are the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Warren Buffett and David Tepper Both Own",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and David Tepper might not seem to have a lot in common -- aside from the fact that they're both wildly successful investors. Buffett is much more cautious by nature and usually shies away from tech stocks. Tepper is aggressive and invests heavily in the tech sector.\n\nBut these billionaires share at least a few common denominators. Here are the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that both Buffett and Tepper own.\n\nGreat minds think alike -- sometimes\n\nTepper's Appaloosa Management hedge fund has positions in most of the Magnificent Seven stocks. The fund's top four holdings are Meta Platforms, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Nvidia. Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) ranks as Appaloosa's seventh-largest position. There are only two Magnificent Seven stocks that Tepper doesn't own -- Apple and Tesla.\n\nBuffett is a huge fan of Apple. Last year, he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at their annual meeting that Apple was \"a better business than any we own.\" It's by far the biggest position for Berkshire, accounting for nearly 43% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nUnlike Tepper, though, Buffett hasn't loaded up on several other Magnificent Seven stocks. The only member of the group besides Apple in Berkshire's portfolio is Amazon. So, is Amazon the only Magnificent Seven stock that both Buffett and Tepper own? Actually, no.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), manages its own investment portfolio. NEAM has small stakes in Alphabet and Microsoft. Therefore, Buffett has positions in these Magnificent Seven stocks also.\n\nBig winners for the two billionaires\n\nAll three of these Magnificent Seven stocks owned by Buffett and Tepper have been big winners. Amazon especially stands out, with a gain of nearly 80% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe generative AI boom has provided a nice tailwind for Amazon as customers built AI apps on its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. Amazon's efforts to increase its profitability have also paid off handsomely.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's shares have soared close to 50% over the last 12 months. Again, generative AI served as the key catalyst behind this impressive performance. Microsoft integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 AI model throughout its products, appealing to customers seeking to harness the power of generative AI.\n\nSome investors might have thought that Alphabet was being left in the dust by Microsoft and OpenAI. However, the tech stock has jumped around 45% over the last 12 months. Alphabet's Google Cloud business is benefiting from the surging interest in generative AI just as AWS and Microsoft's Azure cloud platform are.\n\nAre Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft magnificent stocks to buy now?\n\nJust because Buffett and Tepper own Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft doesn't mean you should buy them too. There are some knocks against these members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nE-commerce isn't the fast-growing market for Amazon that it once was. AI could present a threat to Alphabet's Google Search advertising revenue. Microsoft's valuation is frothy, with shares trading at more than 31 times forward earnings.\n\nHowever, I think that the pros outweigh the cons for all three stocks. The cloud units of Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft should have tremendous growth prospects. Amazon is expanding into new markets, notably including health care. Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business could be a game changer. Microsoft is a more formidable player in gaming with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nSure, these stocks could take a breather after racking up massive gains. For long-term investors, though, I think that Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft remain magnificent stocks to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "43.5% of Warren Buffett's $372 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is considered one of the best investors in history. Since 1965, he has steered the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company to a mind-boggling 4,384,748% increase in value. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up just 31,223% over the same period.\n\nBuffett's investing strategy is simple. He likes companies with steady growth, strong profitability, and high-performing management teams. He's especially fond of those that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. That strict criteria is why so few technology stocks have made their way into Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nA group of companies dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" have captivated investors over the past year with their strong performance and whopping $13.5 trillion in combined valuation. The seven stocks include:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia  Microsoft  Alphabet (parent company of Google) Meta Platforms Tesla\n\nBerkshire owns just two of the above names, but they account for 43.5% of the conglomerate's $372 billion publicly traded stocks and securities portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire's portfolio\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, but it also dominates the cloud computing industry with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, and it has a fast-growing presence in both streaming and digital advertising. Berkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, and while it only accounts for a small fraction of the conglomerate's portfolio, Buffett has often expressed regret for not buying more.\n\nInvestors are firmly focused on artificial intelligence (AI) right now, and Amazon is quickly becoming a leader in that field, too. As the largest cloud platform, AWS is well-positioned to distribute every layer of AI to thousands of businesses worldwide.\n\nAmazon developed its own data center chips called Trainium and Inferentia, which help set its AI infrastructure apart from many other operators who rely solely on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company also created its own large language models (LLMs) under its Titan program, which developers can use to build their own AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, AWS offers businesses some ready-made AI applications. They include CodeWhisperer, which helps programmers write code more quickly, and Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered virtual assistant. Businesses can feed their data into Q, at which point it can answer complex questions, create content, and help employees solve problems.\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023. That was more than Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla combined during their equivalent reporting periods. Yet, on a price-to-sales basis, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than all three of them. AMZN Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nAmazon is a huge organization, so why have I focused mostly on AI? While e-commerce created most of the company's value in the early days -- and still accounts for 41% of its total revenue -- AI will likely help Amazon close that valuation gap in the future thanks to the substantial growth it could deliver.\n\nBuffett might regret not owning more Amazon stock, but Berkshire's position is worth $1.7 billion, which is still a nice chunk of change.\n\n2. Apple: 43% of Berkshire's portfolio\n\nApple produces some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, from the iPhone to the Mac computer. Berkshire started buying Apple stock in 2016, and it has spent approximately $38 billion building its position since then. That's more money than the conglomerate has invested in any other stock except one.\n\nThanks to Apple's strong growth, Berkshire's position is now worth a whopping $160.2 billion, representing 43% of its $372 billion portfolio.\n\nThe iPhone is Apple's most successful product. It accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue, and it led to multibillion-dollar offshoot products like the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, with more than 2.2 billion iPhones currently active around the world, Apple is struggling to generate growth. The company's total revenue actually shrank during fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), and it grew by a modest 2.1% year over year in the recent fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Dec. 30).\n\nApple's services segment remains a bright spot, though. It includes subscription-based platforms like Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV, in addition to other services like Apple Pay. The services segment generated 11.3% in revenue growth during Q1, offsetting the flat hardware sales.\n\nLike Amazon, Apple is turning to AI to unlock its next growth phase. The latest iPhone 15 Pro is fitted with the A17 Pro chip, which is capable of efficiently processing AI workloads on-device. To utilize that computing power, Apple is developing its own LLMs and AI applications in-house, but it's reportedly in talks with leading developers like OpenAI and Alphabet, too.\n\nAdvanced AI will make existing features like the Siri voice assistant far more competent and streamline tasks like writing messages and emails. Plus, a virtual chatbot might reduce the amount of time users spend trawling the internet for information.\n\nGiven the iPhone's enormous installed base, whichever AI platform Apple chooses could instantly become the most widely adopted in the world. I would expect a company like Alphabet to pay billions of dollars to have Apple use its Gemini AI model, the same way it pays Apple to set Google as the default search engine on the iPhone.\n\nBuffett might have to be patient for AI to reignite Apple's growth. However, considering the company paid $3.8 billion in dividends to shareholders and spent $20.1 billion on stock buybacks in the recent quarter alone, he is being paid handsomely while he waits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "FedEx Confidently Delivered An Earnings Growth Surprise Owed To Structural Cost Cuts",
        "content": "On Thursday, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) surprised Wall Street withby surpasing earnings estimates for its fiscal 2024 third quarter, while revenue came short of estimates. Amid a backdrop shaped by macroeconomic uncertainty, FedEx also narrowed its full fiscal year earnings outlook but the midpoint stayed the same as cost cuts are expected to offset a decline from lowered demand of its largest customer, the, U.S. Postal Service, who shifted away from high-margin air services in favor of lower-cost alternatives.\n\nFY2024 third quarter highlights\n\nFor the quarter that ended on February 29th, $21.7 billion, FedEx reported that revenue amounted to $21.7 billion, which is lower compared to fiscal 2023’s comparable quarter when revenue amounted to $22.8 billion.\n\nHowever, operating income improved from fiscal 2023 third quarter’s $1.04 billion to $1.24 billion. As a result, net income grew from $771 million to $879 million.\n\nDespite declining revenue, operating and net income improved due to the successful execution of the company’s DRIVE strategy, along with its continued focus on revenue quality. Through the DRIVE initiative, FedEx aims to lower permanent costs by $4 billion by fiscal 2025 and by the looks of it, these structural changes are already showing a real positive impact on the bottom line.\n\nView more earnings on FDX\n\nMoreover, FedEx’s largest and most struggling unit, Express overnight delivery, also delivered good news. Its operating margin expanded from last year’s comparable quarter, more precisely, from 1.2% to 2.5%. The unit has been struggling with declining volumes due to the U.S. Postal Service opting to use more economical carrier alternatives on the ground.\n\nOn Monday, the Wall Street Journal even reported that FedEx entered talks with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) last year, to discuss teaming up on returns. FedEx and Amazon had a working relationship that ended in 2019 that included a deal to make U.S. ground deliveries, as Amazon not only ships billions of packages on an annual basis, but also receives millions of returns. Amazon uses United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE: UPS) and other carriers to deal with returns, as well as letting customers take their returns to third party locations, such as those of Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS).\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter posting better-than-expected earnings, FedEx executives are confident that the carrier company is on the right path to improving profitability. After all, their self-confidence  to be able to align its network with the evolving demand environment while unlocking profit opportunities has been justified by delivering improved profitability amid a challenging environment. FedEx also mentioned it is in talks with USPS regarding a new multi-year contract agreement, as the existing one is due to expire in September.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos' Ex-Wife Mackenzie Scott Had An 'Excruciating' Job Making And Selling Sandwiches To Pay Rent — Now She Gives Away Billions",
        "content": "MacKenzie Scott is one of the wealthiest women in the world today. People know the story of her ex-husband Jeff Bezos founding Amazon.com Inc. from their garage, but few realize the struggles Scott went through in the years before that world-changing company launched.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAre you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nDrawing on extensive research, including interviews with friends, teachers and colleagues as well as unpublished letters and public records, The New York Times in 2022 provided a detailed look into Scott’s formative years and her philosophical outlook on life, shaped by experiences of hardship and resilience.\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton University, Scott moved to New York City to chase her novelist dreams. But reality hit hard. To stay afloat, she took a waitressing job, an experience she vented about in letters to her mentor author Toni Morrison.\n\n“I guess the only way I’ll know what doesn’t work for me is by trying it,” she wrote in September 1992, worn down by the “excruciating monotony of making and selling sandwiches” and consumed with anxiety over whether her measly tips could cover the rent.\n\nScott’s experiences during these early years laid the groundwork for her eventual success and her views on life’s unpredictable nature. In a 2013 interview with talk show host Charlie Rose, she recounted a Chinese folk tale known as “The Lost Horse,” which she likened to her philosophy on life.\n\n“You never know where it's going to end up. Good luck, bad luck, it's not the way that we really need to look at things,” Scott told Rose. She emphasized that the hardships we endure are often what we’re most grateful for in hindsight, as “they take us where we need to go.”\n\nTrending: How to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 Million — and retire a millionaire.\n\nHer journey took a significant turn when she met Bezos while working at the financial firm D.E. Shaw. The couple moved to Seattle, where they embarked on the ambitious project of building Amazon. This venture, which began in their garage, would transform not only their lives but also the landscape of global retail.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it’s Scott’s life post-divorce that has captured public attention. Following her separation from Bezos in 2019, without a prenuptial agreement, Scott received a substantial portion of Amazon shares. This settlement propelled her into the ranks of the world’s wealthiest people. But rather than simply enjoying her wealth, Scott embarked on a mission of philanthropy. She joined the Giving Pledge, committing to donate the majority of her wealth during her lifetime.\n\nIn less than five years, Scott has donated over $17 billion to various causes, reflecting her dedication to effecting positive change. Through her contributions, Scott has supported a wide range of initiatives, from educational institutions and health organizations to poverty alleviation and racial equality efforts. Her approach to philanthropy — direct, no-strings-attached contributions to organizations — has been both praised for its impact and seen as a call to action for other wealthy individuals.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed – Will you make enough each month?

        "content": "Investors interested in Retail-Wholesale stocks should always be looking to find the best-performing companies in the group. Is Amazon (AMZN) one of those stocks right now? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Retail-Wholesale sector should help us answer this question.\n\nAmazon is one of 218 individual stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Amazon (AMZN)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $181.42 in the previous session. Amazon has gained 17.3% since the start of the year compared to the 10.8% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 10.4% return for the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 1, 2024, Amazon.com reported EPS of $1.01 versus consensus estimate of $0.81 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.23%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Amazon.com is expected to post earnings of $4.08 per share on $641.36 billion in revenues. This represents a 40.69% change in EPS on a 11.58% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.32 per share on $715.6 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 30.38% and 11.58%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nAmazon.com may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nAmazon.com has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 43.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 21X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.6X versus its peer group's average of 19.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.55. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Amazon.com currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Amazon.com meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Amazon.com shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nHow Does AMZN Stack Up to the Competition?\n\nShares of AMZN have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is JD.com, Inc. (JD). JD has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.\n\nEarnings were strong last quarter. JD.com, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 15.38%, and for the current fiscal year, JD is expected to post earnings of $3.14 per share on revenue of $160.06 billion.\n\nShares of JD.com, Inc. have gained 12.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 8.61X and a P/CF of 5.09X.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is in the top 35% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for AMZN and JD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Top Growth Stocks to Buy as Fear of Recession Ebbs",
        "content": "The U.S. economy expanded robustly in the final three months of 2023 and crushed recession fearmongering. Despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening measures to curb inflationary pressure, the economy accelerated at an annualized pace of 3.3% in the final quarter of 2023 and expanded 2.5% last year.\n\nThe economy is now well-poised to trounce recession concerns this year as well and chug along. The Federal Open Market Committee, in its latest policy meeting, kept the benchmark overnight borrowing rate unchanged and reiterated three quarter-percentage-point interest rate cuts by the end of this year. This would mean the first interest rate cuts since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nNow, interest rate cuts are a blessing in disguise for economic growth. After all, it helps in increasing consumer outlays and reduces the cost of borrowing. Talking about consumer spending, American shoppers did open up their wallets in recent times despite sticky inflation and dwindling pandemic savings. Consumers remained resilient, banking on strength in the labor market, a tell-tale sign that the economy continues to stay healthy.\n\nSales at retail outlets rose 0.6% in February from a decline of 1.1% in January, according to the Commerce Department. Notably, spending at retail outlets increased in the seven of the past 10 months through February. Spending at retail outlets primarily improved as employers added jobs at a steady clip last month, while average hourly earnings increased.\n\nMost importantly, the Conference Board’s leading indicator for the economy advanced 0.1% in February, its first increase since February 2022. The gauge is known for predicting whether the economy is improving or getting worse.\n\nHence, with the economy booming amid little sign of a recession, the stock market is well-positioned to scale northward. This calls for investing in growth stocks such as American Woodmark AMWD, Burlington Stores BURL, Central Garden & Pet CENT, DHI Group DHX, and Amazon.com AMZN.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAmerican Woodmark is the third-largest manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets. American Woodmark currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 3% over the past 60 days. AMWD’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 14.4%.\n\nBurlington Stores is a retailer of branded apparel products. Burlington Stores currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 4.5% over the past 60 days. BURL’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 22.1%.\n\nCentral Garden & Pet is one of the leading companies in the U.S. pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies space. Central Garden & Pet currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 13.4% over the past 60 days. CENT’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 10.6%.\n\nDHI Group offers specialized websites that focus on select professional communities.

        "title": "Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Returns On Capital Not Reflecting Well On The Business",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.10 = US$37b ÷ (US$528b - US$165b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 10%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 12%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Amazon.com .\n\nSo How Is Amazon.com's ROCE Trending?\n\nWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Amazon.com, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 13% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a side note, Amazon.com has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 31% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile returns have fallen for Amazon.com in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 101% to shareholders in the last five years. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.\n\nWhile Amazon.com doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 22, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, eBay Inc. EBAY and American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Solid Stocks to Buy as S&P 500 Hits New Record High\n\nWall Street has been on a rally this year, with major indexes hitting all-time highs in the past couple of months. The S&P 500, particularly, is on a dream run, with the index hitting multiple record highs in the past month.\n\nOn Mar 20, the S&P 500 achieved a record high after closing above the 5,200 level for the first time. The index finished at 5,224.62 on Wednesday. Year to date, the index has advanced 9.5%.\n\nThe fresh high came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said that it expects three rate cuts before the end of 2024. Higher interest rates have been hurting consumers over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in July 2023 and kept rates unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking it by 525 basis points.\n\nInflation has cooled in the past several months. Optimism surrounding the end of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign and multiple rate cuts this year has been driving the rally.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also on solid ground, with the GDP growing 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally over the past year has been driven by tech stocks, primarily because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. AI-centered stocks rallied last year and the momentum continues into this year, with a large number of companies trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., eBay Inc. and American Water Works Company, Inc. that have a strong potential in 2024.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Is Selling Alphabet and Nvidia Hand Over Fist, but Is Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper likes artificial intelligence (AI) stocks -- the bigger, the better. Pick a megacap AI stock, and there's a pretty good chance that it's in the portfolio of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management.\n\nTepper isn't as big of a fan of some of these stocks as he is of others, though. The successful hedge fund manager has been selling shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) hand over fist, but he has been buying two other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nNot so magnificent in Tepper's view\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper slashed Appaloosa's stake in Nvidia by nearly 23%. While the GPU maker still ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest holding, Tepper clearly isn't as bullish about it as he once was.\n\nWhy would the billionaire sell such a big chunk of his position in Nvidia? The most likely answer is its valuation. Nvidia's share price skyrocketed by nearly 240% last year. Tepper could have been concerned, as quite a few other investors were, that the stock's valuation was becoming frothy.\n\nAppaloosa also reduced its stake in Alphabet by more than 16%. Again, Tepper hasn't thrown in the towel on the tech giant. Alphabet remains the seventh-largest position in his hedge fund.\n\nValuation probably wasn't the overriding factor behind the decision to sell some of the stake in Alphabet. It's possible, though, that Tepper might have been concerned that Alphabet's revenue from Google Search could be threatened by the development of AI-powered virtual assistants.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks Tepper is buying\n\nSo which Magnificent Seven stocks is Tepper more enthusiastic about? He added to Appaloosa's stakes in two of them.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) already ranked as Appaloosa's third-biggest holding. In Q4, the hedge fund added another 200,000 shares, increasing its stake by more than 5%.\n\nIt's not hard to think of reasons why Tepper might have decided to invest more heavily in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. Its profitability has been improving significantly, and Tepper could expect this trend to continue in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also remains a fan of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The technology giant held the No. 2 spot in Appaloosa's portfolio going into Q4. During the quarter, Tepper bought an additional 65,000 shares of Microsoft -- enough to boost the hedge fund's stake by nearly 4%.\n\nMicrosoft continues to fire on all cylinders. The company's integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model throughout its product lineup appears to be paying off handsomely. Customers are flocking to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and the AI tools that it offers. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard also puts it in a stronger position in the gaming market.\n\nSmart moves?\n\nWere these buy-and-sell transactions of Magnificent Seven stocks smart moves on Tepper's part? So far, the verdict is mixed.\n\nBoth stocks that Appaloosa sold have risen since the end of Q4. Nvidia has soared by nearly 80%, while Alphabet is up close to 6%. Adding to his fund's stakes in Amazon and Microsoft, though, has paid off: Each has jumped by a double-digit percentage thus far in 2024.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft eventually catch up with them. However, any sell-off of those stocks would likely only be temporary.\n\nMy view is that Tepper -- and other investors -- would be wise to scoop up more shares of all four of these Magnificent Seven stocks on pullbacks. I expect that AI will serve as a major long-term tailwind for each of them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

According to estimates from PwC, AI solutions -- i.e., software and systems handling tasks that would normally be assigned to humans -- can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by the end of the decade.\n\nAs of March 15, 44% ($159 billion) of the $366 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was being put to work in three widely owned AI stocks -- and no, Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nApple: $156,317,767,200 (42.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe lion's share of Buffett's \"AI holdings\" can be traced to the largest position in Berkshire's investment portfolio: tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple accounts for more than 4 times the weighting of Bank America, which is Berkshire's second-largest holding (10% of invested assets).\n\nAlthough Apple isn't developing the infrastructure that's made Nvidia the foundation of the AI movement, AI solutions are embedded in virtually all of its products and are critical to the company's long-term growth strategy. Apple uses AI to improve the autocorrect and word suggestion capabilities of its U.S. market-share-leading iPhone, and recently launched its mixed-reality Vision Pro headset, which incorporates eye- and hand-tracking using AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile artificial intelligence solutions are staples in Apple's products, Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, undoubtedly purchased shares of Apple for different reasons.\n\nOne of the primary lures of Apple is its exceptional customer loyalty. It's one of the most well-known and valuable global brands. Sustaining a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market means consumers eagerly await the annual launch of a new iPhone.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha is likely also enamored with Apple's top-notch management team. In addition to constantly improving the functionality of iPhone and developing the Apple Watch, Apple CEO Tim Cook is spearheading a transformation that's seen his company become more services oriented. Emphasizing subscription services should steadily improve Apple's margins, smooth out the sales fluctuations observed during the tail end of major iPhone upgrade cycles, and encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nThe other reason Buffett is a big fan of Apple is the company's unmatched capital-return program. Apple returned just a hair over $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders last year, and has repurchased a jaw-dropping $651 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. This means Berkshire is steadily becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to lift a finger.\n\nAmazon: $1,744,200,000 (0.5% of invested assets)\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock you'll find nestled in Warren Buffett's $366 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is none other than e-commerce kingpin Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAmazon is utilizing AI in more ways than can be counted here. Some examples include analyzing what you're purchasing and putting in your shopping cart to recommend new products, as well as allowing its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to build applications using generative AI to tailor advertisements and improve customer interactions.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is developing its own graphics processing units (GPUs) for its in-house data centers that could complement, or even replace, the GPUs from Nvidia that have taken the AI movement by storm.\n\nWhile most people are familiar with Amazon because of its overwhelmingly dominant online marketplace, it's actually the company's ancillary operating segments that do a majority of the heavy lifting. Arguably no segment is more important than AWS.\n\nLast year, AWS accounted for about a sixth of Amazon's net sales, but was responsible for two-thirds of the company's operating income. Enterprise cloud spending still appears to be in its relatively early innings of expansion, which suggests AWS has many years of double-digit sales growth ahead. As of September 2023, AWS led all other cloud infrastructure service platforms with a 31% share of global spend.\n\nInterestingly enough, Amazon is fairly inexpensive, too. Shares can be scooped up right now for a greater than 40% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period. While this may not be the traditional \"value stock\" Buffett looks for, it's certainly something that has piqued the interest of one or both of his top investment aides. Images source: Getty Images.\n\nSnowflake: $961,500,271 (0.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe third AI stock that, collectively with Apple and Amazon, accounts for approximately 44% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). This is another Berkshire holding that was almost certainly added because of the influence of Weschler or Combs.\n\nSnowflake really put itself on the map of AI investors this past summer when it announced a collaboration with Nvidia that would allow Snowflake accounts to utilize Nvidia's high-powered GPUs. Snowflake is also making generative AI solutions available to its customers to assist with training, customizing, and deploying large language models.\n\nWhat's really drawn investors to Snowflake since it went public in September 2020 is its well defined competitive advantages. For instance, it can be challenging for users of competing cloud infrastructure service platforms to share information. Since Snowflake built its infrastructure atop the most popular cloud platforms, sharing and transferring data is seamless.\n\nCustomers also seem to appreciate Snowflake's transparent pricing policy. Instead of utilizing subscription pricing like many of its peers, Snowflake has opted to charge users based on how much data they store and how many Snowflake Compute Credits they use.\n\nBut in spite of these well-defined competitive edges, justifying Snowflake's premium valuation has been challenging. Its days of triple-digit sales growth are long gone. With businesses still cautious about the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, Snowflake's annual sales growth is expected to slow to approximately 22% in the current fiscal year. At north of 160 times estimated earnings per share, investors might be wise to keep their distance and allow Snowflake to grow into its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "12 Most Congested Cities in Florida",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 12 Most Congested Cities in Florida. You can also take a detailed look at the 5 Most Congested Cities in Florida.\n\nNavigating through the bustling streets of Florida's cities can often feel like a journey fraught with delays and frustrations. As one of the most populous states in the United States, Florida faces significant challenges in managing traffic congestion, with several cities earning notoriety for their gridlocked roadways and lengthy commute times\n\nCongestion in cities arises from a complex interplay of factors, including population growth, urbanization, inadequate transportation infrastructure, and inefficient land use planning. According to the Global Traffic Scorecard by INRIX, Miami ranks as the 10th most congested city in the United States, with drivers spending an average of 54 hours stuck in traffic congestion annually. Similarly, Orlando and Tampa also feature prominently on the list, highlighting the statewide nature of the issue.\n\nPopulation growth serves as a primary driver of congestion, with Florida experiencing a steady influx of residents drawn by its warm climate and economic opportunities. The state's population is projected to reach 23.3 million by 2030, further exacerbating traffic congestion if adequate measures are not implemented.\n\nIn addition to population growth, urbanization patterns play a crucial role in shaping congestion levels. Sprawling development, characterized by low-density housing and decentralized commercial centers, forces residents to rely heavily on automobiles for transportation. Consequently, this increases traffic volumes on already congested roadways, leading to slower travel speeds and longer commute times.\n\nThe impact of congestion on city life extends beyond mere inconvenience, affecting various aspects of urban living. Prolonged commute times result in decreased productivity, as workers spend more time stuck in traffic and less time engaged in productive activities. Moreover, congestion contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, posing significant environmental and public health concerns. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, traffic congestion costs the state of Florida $4.2 billion annually in wasted time and fuel.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobally, the issue of congestion is not unique to Florida but represents a broader urban challenge faced by cities worldwide. With rapid urbanization and population growth driving increased demand for mobility, cities across the globe are grappling with finding sustainable solutions to alleviate congestion and improve the quality of life for their residents.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of traffic congestion extends far beyond the inconvenience it causes for individual commuters; it also has significant implications for businesses operating within congested cities in Florida. According to a study conducted by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, congestion costs businesses in the United States approximately $166 billion annually in lost productivity and increased operating expenses. In Florida, where several cities rank among the most congested in the nation, the economic toll on businesses is particularly pronounced.\n\nOne of the most immediate effects of congestion on businesses is the loss of productivity due to employees spending more time stuck in traffic. Delays in commuting can lead to tardiness, increased absenteeism, and decreased morale among employees. A report by the South Florida Business Journal indicates that traffic congestion in Miami-Dade County alone costs businesses an estimated $3.6 billion annually in lost productivity.\n\nMoreover, congestion can impede the timely delivery of goods and services, affecting supply chains and logistics operations. Businesses reliant on just-in-time delivery models may face challenges in meeting customer demand and fulfilling orders promptly. According to the American Transportation Research Institute, congestion on Florida's roadways contributes to increased transportation costs, with commercial trucks spending an average of 1.4 million hours annually stuck in traffic.\n\nCompanies that rely on timely deliveries, such as e-commerce retailers, food delivery services, and courier companies, face significant challenges due to traffic congestion. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a major player in e-commerce, reported spending over $1.2 billion on shipping costs in Florida in 2020. Congestion-related delays can disrupt delivery schedules, leading to customer dissatisfaction and increased operational costs. With the rise of online shopping, the demand for timely deliveries has surged, placing significant pressure on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s logistics infrastructure. However, traffic congestion poses a considerable challenge to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s delivery operations, affecting both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nTraffic congestion increases the time it takes for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivery vehicles to navigate Florida's roadways, resulting in longer delivery times and higher operational costs. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) must allocate additional resources to account for potential delays caused by traffic congestion, such as hiring more drivers and investing in route optimization technology. According to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s annual financial reports, the company's shipping costs in the United States have been steadily increasing, reaching $21.7 billion in 2020. Overall, traffic congestion poses significant challenges for delivery services like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operating in Florida, impacting operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and environmental sustainability. 12 Most Congested Cities in Florida\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo curate the list of the most congested cities in Florida, we shortlisted the 12 Most Congested Cities in Florida by scouring the internet, looking through articles and rankings from prominent websites.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 industries which produce the most billionaires. We have also talked about the latest news surrounding billionaires and their wealth. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Industries that Produce the Most Billionaires.\n\nIn 2023, the top 10 billionaires experienced a phenomenal increase in wealth, collectively amassing an additional $465.6 billion—an impressive 46% increase compared to the S&P 500's 24% annual gain. Leading this financial ascent was Elon Musk, whose net worth catapulted from $137 billion to $229 billion within the year, followed closely by Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s Mark Zuckerberg, who increased from $45.6 billion to $128 billion.\n\nEven philanthropic endeavors couldn't halt the upward trajectory of billionaire wealth. Warren Buffett, despite donating $5 billion in June and $870 million in November of the previous year, witnessed $13 billion increase in his net worth since January 2, 2023.\n\nNonetheless, despite the increase in billionaire wealth, President Biden proposed major tax reforms in his State of the Union address on March 8, 2024 with an aim to increase taxes on billionaires and corporations. Biden suggested raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and implementing a minimum tax for billionaires at 25%. He highlighted the disparity in tax rates, noting that some of America's wealthiest individuals pay lower federal taxes than average citizens. Additionally, Biden emphasized the need to end tax breaks for industries such as Big Pharma and Big Oil, while also advocating for a reduction in CEO salaries.\n\nThese proposals represent Biden's attempt to distinguish his progressive agenda from his Republican rival, Donald Trump, ahead of the upcoming elections. However, the feasibility of these reforms remains uncertain, as they require congressional approval.\n\nWhile billionaires are the highlight of our discussion, let’s talk about achieving the millionaire status now. In a survey by Ameriprise Financial, 80% of Americans with $1 million or more in investable assets attributed their financial success to financial planning and investing. Additionally, 70% acknowledged making a good income and living within their means as key factors. Only 13% credited luck for their wealth. Between 2019 and 2022, approximately 6 million American households saw their net worth exceed $1 million. Ameriprise's study, focusing on 580 Americans, aimed to understand how individuals reached the $1 million savings milestone. The study revealed that 85% of respondents associated wealth with financial security, 66% linked it to providing for family, and 58% to personal freedom.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, another study found that middle-aged and millennial workers estimated needing $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for comfortable retirement, yet less than a third of each group expected to achieve these goals. While 60% of millionaires considered themselves upper middle class, only 8% classified themselves as wealthy.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the light of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s trajectory, its capitalization and diverse business portfolio, the prospect of achieving millionaire status through investment in the tech giant has become more tangible. The company's stock growth over recent decades has been remarkable, with its market capitalization nearing $3 trillion, surpassing even Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite a seemingly lofty valuation, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s diverse business model spanning cloud services, gaming, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence positions it as a leader across various tech sectors. Its solid financial foundation, with over $140 billion in cash reserves and significant operating cash flow, ensures resilience and agility in navigating market fluctuations and seizing growth opportunities through innovation or acquisitions. While Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock may command a premium, its potential to sustain market-beating returns remains promising, supported by its ongoing technological advancements and established market presence.\n\nInvestors looking to secure a place in the millionaire club should weigh Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock alongside other options. While its valuation might appear steep compared to peers like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s strong growth prospects and financial strength offer a compelling case for long-term investment.\n\nOn the other hand, the Walton family stands atop America's richest families list with a monumental net worth of $267 billion as of 2024, primarily fueled by their major stake in Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer. Holding an estimated 45% of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s stock, the family's wealth is distributed among seven heirs of Sam and Bud Walton, the founders. Rob Walton's tenure as chairman and strategic investments, such as the purchase of the NFL's Denver Broncos for $4.7 billion, have contributed to their financial prowess. Additionally, their fortune is further strengthened by the ownership of sports teams, including the Los Angeles Rams and Arsenal, through Stan Kroenke's ties to the family.\n\nSpeaking of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), it is also the largest private employer in the US. 15 Industries Which Produce the Most Billionaires\n\nA busy cityscape of financial buildings, emphasizing the importance of the industry for the economy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine industries which produce the most billionaires, we analyzed Forbes' 2023 Billionaires list. By dividing the number of billionaires in each industry by the total number of billionaires on the list, we calculated the percentage share of billionaires for each industry. Consequently, we arranged the industries in ascending order based on their share of billionaires.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Sports\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.4%\n\nIn 2023, a dozen new billionaires emerged from the sports industry, marking a major trend in wealth creation. LeBron James and Tiger Woods notably became the first active athletes to achieve a billion-dollar net worth, symbolizing the immense financial potential within sports. Booming media rights deals have skyrocketed team values and athlete earnings, with 94 of the top 100 US telecasts being sports events. Ownership of sports teams, exemplified by figures like Mark Davis and Amy Adams Strunk, has become a cornerstone asset for many, yielding substantial returns. Given the potential, sports is one of the most powerful future billionaire industries.\n\n14. Logistics\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.5%\n\nThe logistics industry stands out as a surprising source of immense wealth, with only 35 billionaires globally attributing their fortunes to this sector. Among them, eight are Chinese, and six are American. As of March 8, 2023, there are only three female billionaires in logistics. Johnelle Hunt leads the pack with a net worth of $4.5 billion, followed by Xiaojuan Zhang with $1.8 billion, and Liying Chen with $1.1 billion.\n\n13. Construction and Engineering\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 1.7%\n\nThe construction and engineering industry has unparalleled potential for producing billionaires, evidenced by the net worths of its top figures. Diane Hendricks leads the list with a colossal $22.4 billion fortune, followed by Nassef Sawiris at $8.5 billion, Anthony Bamford at $7.1 billion, and Thomas Schmidheiny at $6.5 billion. Rafael Del Pino and Peter Gilgan claim the fifth and sixth spots with $5.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.\n\n12. Automotive\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 2.80%\n\nApart from being one of the industries which produce the most billionaires in the world, automotive engineering stands as the breeding ground for billionaire women, like Susanne Klatten, Gail Miller, and Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler, that have amassed huge amounts of wealth. Klatten's strategic investments and BMW ownership contribute to her $26.4 billion fortune, while Miller's diversified business empire yields $3.9 billion. Schaeffler's leadership in auto parts manufacturing, valued at $8.2 billion, highlights the sector's lucrative opportunities.\n\n11. Metals and Mining\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 2.84%\n\nAs one of the best industries to become a billionaire, the metals and mining industry harbors immense potential for creating billionaires, as evidenced by the incredible net worth figures of its top players. With Savitri Jindal leading the list at $31.1 billion, followed closely by Gina Rinehart with $30.8 billion, it's evident that fortunes in this sector go up to astronomical heights. The industry's top ten billionaires collectively amass over $235 billion, showcasing the immense wealth generation capacity.\n\n10. Media and Entertainment\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 3%\n\nThe media and entertainment industry is globally known as the billionaire-producing powerhouse due to its multifaceted nature and global reach. Giants like Disney, Comcast, and Netflix have capitalized on their innovative content creation, distribution platforms, and strategic acquisitions to amass vast fortunes. Additionally, the convergence of technology with media has birthed moguls like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who capitalized on streaming services through Amazon Prime Video. From film production to streaming services, the industry's ability to capture the attention and wallets of billions worldwide ensures its continuous growth.\n\n9. Energy\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 4%\n\nEnergy is one of the industries that makes the most money in the world and hence, most billionaires. Companies like ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Chevron dominate this landscape, propelled by the perpetual demand for oil, gas, and renewable energy sources. The sector's inherent capital-intensive nature, coupled with its strategic importance in driving economies, fosters immense wealth accumulation for its key players.\n\n8. Diversified\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 7%\n\nComprising 7% of the list, there are 187 billionaires categorized under diversified industries in 2023 by Forbes. The wealthiest among them is Mukesh Ambani, with a net worth of $83.4 billion. Ambani serves as the chairman of Reliance Industries, a conglomerate with investments spanning petrochemicals, oil and gas, retail, and telecommunications sectors, showcasing a wide-ranging portfolio of interests. Hence, it is not wrong to say there are diversified industries which can produce the most billionaires in India.\n\n7. Real Estate\n\nShare in the Billionaire List: 7%\n\nAs one of the top 10 industries which produce the most billionaires, real estate comprises 7% of the list with 193 billionaires in 2023.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 US states with the highest labor shortages. We have also discussed the implications of the labor shortages for businesses. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.\n\nThe labor shortage gripping the United States is starkly evident: with 9.5 million job openings but only 6.5 million unemployed workers, a deficit of 3 million remains. Despite the addition of 4.5 million jobs in 2022, the shortage persists, exacerbated by declining labor force participation rates since before the pandemic. This shortage spans industries and states, impacting businesses of all sizes and types, hindering their ability to fill essential roles. It is worth highlighting that healthcare is one of the most affected industries due to labor shortages in the US.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this crisis. Early retirements increased during the pandemic, with over 3 million adults opting for early retirement by October 2021. Simultaneously, net international migration plummeted, slowing population growth and constraining the labor pool.\n\nMoreover, shifts in economic dynamics, such as increased savings due to enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, compounded the shortage. The \"Great Reshuffle\" saw record quit rates as workers sought better opportunities or opted for entrepreneurship. While solutions are being pursued, the multifaceted nature of the shortage demands comprehensive approaches addressing retirement trends, immigration policies, childcare accessibility, and economic incentives to entice workers back into the labor force.\n\nOwing to the major labor shortages in country, several businesses across the country have been disrupted. Thousands of businesses have reduced hours or closed due to unfilled positions, causing a ripple effect in various industries. The scarcity of workers not only slows production but also leads to price pressures on goods ranging from cars to household essentials like baby formula and cleaning products. To read more about skilled labor shortages, see the countries with the highest labor shortages in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe situation is dire, with over 50 million US workers leaving their jobs in 2022, the highest number on record. Economists have termed it \"quiet quitting\". However, there's nothing subtle about the challenges facing America's workforce. Industries such as transportation, hospitality, manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare are particularly hard-hit, struggling to find essential personnel like truck drivers, hotel staff, and healthcare technicians.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that a substantial portion of these labor shortages are essentially skill labor shortages. To address these skill shortages, many companies have been trying to bridge the gap through several initiatives.\n\nFor example, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers free education and training programs to equip learners with AI skills for tomorrow’s workforce. With AI transforming various industries, including finance, IT, sales, and marketing, demand for AI-trained professionals is growing. A survey conducted in four US regions revealed that over 60% of educators believe AI skills are essential for future high-paying careers. However, despite this recognition, many educators lack resources to teach AI effectively, with 69% reporting a shortage of necessary materials and training programs. To read more about AI transformation, see industries being revolutionized by AI and automation technologies.\n\nThe study also suggests a modest increase in AI courses in US schools, expected to rise by approximately 1.5 times in the next five years. Recognizing the need to bridge this gap, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched its AI Ready initiative, aiming to provide free AI skills training to 2 million individuals by 2025. The initiative aligns with findings that show strong demand for AI talent, with potential salary increases of up to 47% for workers with AI skills. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports educators and students through various programs, including funding STEM curriculum, offering scholarships, and providing career exploration opportunities.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has partnered with industry experts to predict AI-enabled careers of the future. These roles span diverse sectors, from precision farming analysts leveraging AI to optimize agricultural processes to cosmic reality engineers visualizing distant galaxies using advanced AI systems. As AI continues to reshape industries, preparing students and professionals with foundational AI skills becomes crucial. By investing in education and training, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)  aims to empower individuals for a tech-enabled workforce, fostering innovation and addressing the evolving demands of tomorrow’s job market.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched updated professional training and certifications for IT support and management, responding to the growing demand for skilled technical staff. With projections indicating faster-than-average growth in computer and information systems occupations from 2020 to 2030, the need for proficient IT professionals is evident. This demand is further fueled by the increasing use of  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac in workplaces. The redesigned training is now available online, providing self-paced learning opportunities.\n\nThe training comprises two sequential courses:  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  Device Support and  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Deployment and Management. These courses equip learners with essential skills for supporting and managing  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, covering topics such as device deployment, management, and security using mobile device management solutions. Upon completion of each course, learners can take certification exams to demonstrate their competence, enhancing their job prospects in the competitive IT landscape.\n\nTo ensure accessibility,  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  offers scholarships for exam fees through its Community Education Initiative (CEI) at partnering institutions. Additionally, the Mac Admins Foundation collaborates with  Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  to provide vouchers to applicants with financial need, promoting inclusivity and affordability in accessing certification exams. 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages\n\nGts/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the states with the highest labor shortages, we used unemployment level for the number of workers available in each states and utilized the averaged data between September and November 2023 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We calculated the ratio of workers available for every 100 job openings. The list is presented in descending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

District of Columbia (DC)\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50\n\nDC is facing a major deficit in case workers, with vacancies reaching approximately 30% in the School Behavioral Health Program. Despite efforts like Operation Make Movement to expedite housing subsidies, staffing constraints persist, with a workforce survey revealing a 21% vacancy rate across organizations. To address this crisis, the D.C. Council approved a bill funding graduate degrees in social work, aiming to alleviate shortages by subsidizing education for 20 Washingtonians initially, with plans to expand to 40 annually.\n\n14. Colorado\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50\n\nColorado has a strong labor force with a 68.8% participation rate, 5 points above the national average, and a pre-pandemic unemployment rate of 3.2%, below the national average. Before the pandemic, there were 79 workers for every 100 open positions. As of August 2023, the labor market has largely recovered, with unemployment and participation rates back to pre-pandemic levels. However, a worsening worker shortage is evident, with only 50 workers available for every 100 open jobs.\n\n13. Tennessee\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 50\n\nAs one of the states with the worst labor shortages in 2024, Tennessee is also struggling with a concerning teacher shortage, as revealed by a recent analysis from the State Collaborative on Reforming Education (SCORE). Statewide, there are approximately 60,000 teachers in the workforce, with over 1,000 unfilled vacancies, a third of which are in the critical K-5 grade band. While nearly a third of districts reported no vacancies, the state's shortage aligns with the national average.\n\n12. Virginia\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 47\n\nAs one of the states that need the most workers, Virginia was ranked in the \"more severe\" category, according to the US Chamber of Commerce. Data reveals a stark contrast from pre-pandemic times, with 245,000 job openings and only 112,959 unemployed workers, resulting in 47 available workers for every 100 open positions. Despite rebounding labor force participation rates and low unemployment figures, the state faces challenges in filling vacancies, exacerbated by factors like decreased immigration and pandemic-induced workforce shifts.\n\n11. Montana\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 47\n\nThe state of Montana is plagued with a severe labor deficit with a Worker Shortage Index at 0.47. Job openings have increased to 35,000 while only 14,691 are unemployed. The labor force participation rate stagnates at 62.7, with a mere 2.5% unemployment rate. The quit rate peaks at 3.1, confirming dissatisfaction, while the hiring rate rests at 4.8.\n\n10. South Carolina\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nSouth Carolina is fighting with an alarming labor shortage, particularly evident in the agricultural sector. Titan Farms, one of the largest peach growers on the East Coast, is currently facing the challenge of filling 1,200 positions with only two U.S.-born workers willing to take on the job. The peach industry alone contributes $400 million to the state's economy, yet without the federal H-2A work visa program, crucial agricultural businesses like Titan Farms would struggle to survive. The shortage stems from a shift in the workforce as more South Carolinians pursue careers outside of farm labor, opting for professions such as electricians, bankers, and lawyers.\n\n9. Massachusetts\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nMassachusetts faces a profound labor shortage with significant numbers indicating the severity. Approximately 10,000 Baby Boomers retire daily, contributing to the workforce gap. This situation is exacerbated by a national statistic showing 3.5 million more job openings than available workers. To address this, immigration reform is crucial, as immigrants significantly contribute to sectors like healthcare. Moreover, tackling housing costs and living expenses is vital for attracting and retaining talent within the state.\n\n8. Maine\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nDespite historically low immigrant populations, Maine's recent influx from Somalia and other African countries, particularly in cities like Portland and Lewiston, has supported the foreign-born demographic by about 1% between 2000 and 2022. The proposed Office of New Americans aims to address shortages in critical sectors like healthcare, education, and construction.\n\n7. Alabama\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 43\n\nAlabama is facing a critical labor shortage, with only 57% of working-age adults actively seeking employment as of September 2023. This shortage amounts to nearly 100,000 more job openings than available workers. The scarcity of labor empowers workers to demand better wages and benefits, but it also poses challenges for businesses and policymakers.\n\n6. Nebraska\n\nUnemployed Workers for Every 100 Job Openings: 40\n\nNebraska faces a workforce challenge with only 40 available workers per 100 open jobs, resulting in a Worker Shortage Index of 0.39. Despite a low unemployment rate of 2.0%, job openings stand at 54,000 against 21,145 unemployed workers. The state's labor force participation rate is 69.2%, with a quit rate of 2.3% and a hiring rate of 3.6%.\n\nClick here to see the 5 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In Europe 15 Countries With The Highest Labor Shortages In The World 15 Best Countries That Need English Teachers\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 US States With The Highest Labor Shortages is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 countries with the worst English accents in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries with the Worst English Accents in the World.\n\nEnglish is one of the most spoken languages in the world, with approximately 1.5 billion speakers around the globe. It is recognized as an international business language and is taught as a mandatory skill in most of the countries. According to a report by The University of Winnipeg, 142 countries worldwide teach English as a mandatory element of their national curriculums. Moreover, 41 countries treat it as a popular foreign language.\n\nSpeaking good English brings enhanced business opportunities and attracts growth and profitability. According to a survey conducted by EF English First, business customers were willing to pay 16% extra to a supplier with a high level of English proficiency. On the other hand, 53% of the respondents view organizations without a good grasp of English as unprofessional. In addition, the subsequent research on the survey found that a high level of English proficiency could help grow your business by 31% in 5 years.\n\nEconomic Analysis of Countries with the Best English Accent\n\nAccording to data, the United States, the United Kingdom, and European countries have the best English accents. These highly proficient English-speaking countries are also recognized as some of the world's most advanced economies.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Outlook Report 2024 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth in the advanced economies is projected to slow down slightly to 1.6% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024 before rising again to 1.8% in 2025. In the United States, growth is anticipated to decline from 2.5% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, attributed to stringent fiscal and monetary policies and a deceleration in aggregate demand within the labor market. On the other hand, the economic growth in the euro region is expected to recover from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.9% in 2024, finally reaching 1.7% in 2025.

        "content": "For Jeff Bezos, raising resourceful children wasn’t just a parenting goal — it was a necessity for success.\n\nDuring a Summit interview with his brother Mark Bezos in 2017, Jeff Bezos explained how crucial self-reliance and resourcefulness are at Amazon.com Inc. He revealed his unconventional approach to instilling these qualities in his four children, letting them use “sharp knives” from as young as age 4 and power tools by ages 7 or 8.\n\nWhile this may raise eyebrows, Bezos said it stemmed from his ex-wife Mackenzie Scott’s pragmatic perspective. She’d “much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid,\" he said, emphasizing this was “a fantastic attitude about life.”\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAverage retirement income in America has been revealed – Will you make enough each month? US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.\n\nBezos’s brother then joked, “Luckily you have resourceful kids with 10 fingers.” To which Bezos added with a laugh, “So far.”\n\nThis exchange highlighted the Bezos family’s focus on instilling self-reliance and hands-on problem-solving abilities from an early age, prioritizing those skills over sheltering children completely from risk.\n\nJeff Bezos's childhood proved crucial in developing this mindset. Spending summers on his grandfather’s remote ranch, Bezos witnessed the value of hands-on problem-solving firsthand. When equipment broke down, his grandfather didn’t call for help — he rolled up his sleeves, figured out solutions and often enlisted young Jeff to assist on ambitious projects.\n\nTrending: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.\n\nThis early immersion in a self-reliant lifestyle stuck with Bezos. He saw how resourcefulness was a powerful tool, one that could open doors and create opportunities. When he founded Amazon, he carried that same spirit of determined problem-solving through failures and obstacles.\n\nStory continues\n\nBezos embraced a mindset of inventiveness, stating in Amazon’s 1997 shareholder letter, “Given a 10% chance of a 100X payout, you should take that bet every time.”\n\nHis approach ties into Amazon’s core leadership principles emphasizing invention, simplicity and high standards. His belief in fostering self-reliance and problem-solving mirrors Amazon’s ethos of innovation and customer obsession, aiming to build leaders who are not afraid to challenge the status quo and strive for excellence. This philosophy is deeply ingrained in how Amazon operates, seeking to innovate on behalf of customers while maintaining a culture of continuous improvement and learning.\n\nWhile few would advocate giving 4-year-olds knives, Bezos’s core parenting philosophy was centered on raising confident, resilient kids unafraid of challenges. By pushing them to take calculated risks and get hands-on experience, he hoped to spark creativity, ingenuity and grit — skills just as vital as academic lessons.\n\nBezos knew the resource-makers would be the ones equipped to seize opportunities. It’s a controversial approach, but one he lived himself. He raised his children to focus on self-reliant problem-solving, just as his grandfather had with him decades before on that remote ranch.\n\nRead More:\n\nThis startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breathtaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now for Less than $1,000",
        "content": "If you're sitting on some extra cash, there's not a better time to consider putting that money to work in the stock market. Leading tech companies like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have reported improving growth over the last year, but these companies have great prospects in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAn investor with less than $1,000 could buy at least one share of each stock right now. Here's why these two companies are no-brainer investments.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nOver the last 10 years, shares of Alphabet knocked it out of the park for investors, as the company rode strong tailwinds in the digital advertising market. The stock has returned 147% over the last five years and is sitting close to new highs as the online advertising market recovers from the macroeconomic headwinds, but the market still underestimates Google's advantages in data and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe stock offers an attractive valuation to get started with a new investment. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21. This ratio suggests the stock is quite affordable, especially given the company's recent earnings growth (it was up 27% in 2023 and is expected to rise another 17% in 2024).\n\nAlphabet should maintain strong growth. It has an advantage with lots of data from billions of users that rely on Google products. This will enable the company to make its Gemini AI model smarter and create sophisticated tools for content creators on YouTube, and importantly, advertisers.\n\nAI will also drive demand for Google Cloud, which is starting to turn a profit after years of losses. The cloud business is turning the corner financially while seeing demand for generative AI services. Top brands recently expanded their relationship with Google Cloud, including McDonald's and Verizon Communications.\n\nFor these reasons, the stock is a no-brainer buy in 2024.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon stock has been an outstanding performer for investors. Strong growth in the company's online retail and cloud businesses sent the stock soaring over the last decade, and it's currently up 101% in just the last five years. Following the stock's steep decline in 2022, it is on the rebound and could have significant upside as growth across the business starts to pick up again.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's most impressive about Amazon's performance right now is that management is squeezing more profit out of the business while still doing the same things that built the brand over the last two decades. It's adding more value for customers with same-day delivery and keeping retail prices competitive while posting a whopping 383% year-over-year increase in operating profit in 2023's fourth quarter.\n\nIn fact, Amazon generated record operating profit of $36.8 billion last year, and management previously mentioned it's still finding ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the retail business.\n\nAmazon still has several areas outside of retail to deliver returns to shareholders. Online and physical stores made up only 43% of Amazon's total revenue last year. The rest came from growing revenue streams in high-margin businesses like advertising, subscriptions, third-party seller services, and the Amazon Web Services cloud business.\n\nAmazon could grow its profits substantially over the next decade. It still has a significant runway for growth in global e-commerce and cloud services. These opportunities can allow Amazon to reach $100 billion in operating profit within the next 10 years. That would push the stock's value higher, making the shares a no-brainer investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Justice Department filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL), alleging that the tech giant illegally maintains its dominance over its iPhone ecosystem by boxing out competing services from other companies.\n\nApple said it would fight the lawsuit, which it said \"threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple.\"\n\nA victory for the US in this case \"would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology,\" Apple added in its statement.\n\nApple's stock was down roughly 3% following news of the lawsuit, which the Justice Department filed with 16 state attorneys general.\n\nThe filing sets up yet another confrontation between the US government and a Silicon Valley icon as the Biden administration tries to rein in Big Tech's power.\n\nThe Department of Justice is suing Google (GOOG, GOOGL) over antitrust allegations, while the Federal Trade Commission is suing Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (META) alleging they also violate antitrust laws. Apple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Loren Elliott (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe new DOJ lawsuit filed Thursday poses a major new threat to Apple's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nThe DOJ's suit comes just weeks after the European Commission (EC) fined Apple $2 billion for allegedly breaking competition laws in the bloc. The EC alleged the company illegally wielded its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Justice Department suit is just the latest headache for Apple, which is off to a rough start to 2024.\n\nShares of Apple are down 7% year-to-date, as the company struggles with slowing iPhone sales in China, its third-largest market. Apple also lost its title of the world's most valuable company to rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on Twitter @alexiskweed.\n\nGot a tip?

        "content": "FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX) is set to release earnings results for its third quarter, after the closing bell on March 21, 2024.\n\nAnalysts expect the Memphis, Tennessee-based company to report quarterly earnings at $3.46 per share, up from $3.41 per share in the year-ago period. FedEx is projected to post quarterly revenue of $22.06 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nFollowing a notable split, FedEx and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reportedly explored potential collaborations, seeking mutual benefits. Last year, discussions between the two behemoths revolved around FedEx accepting Amazon returns at its retail locations, enriching FedEx’s business portfolio, according to a WSJ report.\n\nWith the recent buzz around FedEx, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now, FedEx has a dividend yield of 1.94%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $1.26 a share ($5.04 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from FedEx, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by FedEx $5.04 dividend: $6,000 / $5.04 = 1,190 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $309,388 worth of FedEx, or 1,190 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $5.04 = 238 shares, or $61,878 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on FDX\n\nAlso Read:  Jim Cramer Says This EV Manufacturer Is 'Well-Run,' Recommends Selling iRobot\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nFDX Price Action: Shares of FedEx gained 1.3% to close at $259.99 on Wednesday.\n\nRead More: Insiders Buying Advance Auto Parts And 2 Other Stocks\n\nImage: Pixabay\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nFEDEX (FDX): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From FedEx Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Wall Street has been on a rally this year, with major indexes hitting all-time highs in the past couple of months. The S&P 500, particularly, is on a dream run, with the index hitting multiple record highs in the past month.\n\nOn Mar 20, the S&P 500 achieved a record high after closing above the 5,200 level for the first time. The index finished at 5,224.62 on Wednesday. Year to date, the index has advanced 9.5%.\n\nThe fresh high came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said that it expects three rate cuts before the end of 2024. Higher interest rates have been hurting consumers over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in July 2023 and kept rates unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking it by 525 basis points.\n\nInflation has cooled in the past several months. Optimism surrounding the end of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign and multiple rate cuts this year has been driving the rally.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also on solid ground, with the GDP growing 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally over the past year has been driven by tech stocks, primarily because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI.

While transit time is faster for ground service, the service offerings, operational network and technology have largely remained unchanged.\n\nFor example, the transit time commitments for overnight express delivery are still 10:30 a.m. and noon, the bar codes are the same despite major advancement in technology, and the zone concept — developed by the U.S. Postal Service many decades ago and before the interstate highways were built for faster transportation — is the same.\n\nEven more shocking is that both FedEx and UPS still have a three-day deferred service as part of their portfolio of express services when their ground service is now faster in many lanes and at a considerably lower cost.\n\nFurthermore, while the express services offered guaranteed delivery or money back for service failure, that guarantee was first suspended with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nThen, after the pandemic was over, the guarantee was only restored for overnight express service. As such, two-day air express and three-day deferred express services offer no premium value for the much higher charge while being no faster, and at times being even slower than ground service.\n\nAnd, since 1985, the customers have evolved dramaticall,y resulting in the following changes: More products are ordered online and 24 hours a day, thereby offering opportunity for pickup even in the morning, with more deliveries made to residences than 30 years ago.\n\nEven businesses have the ability to communicate more frequently in a day, allowing premium express parcels to be delivered at desired times for different office complexes, and to avoid parcels being shipped for overnight delivery by 7:30 a.m. only for the delivery driver to find the offices are not open.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, a combination of routing software and skills of AI now allows carriers to optimize their service offerings that meet their operational network to balance customer preferences with delivery density to achieve a higher level of customer experience at a lower cost, which was impractical in the past.\n\nAmong the three national for-hire carriers, the Postal Service has been the only one to realign its parcel service offering. Last summer, when it combined three parcel services (first class, parcel select ground and retail ground) into Ground Advantage and included $100 of insurance, it made the least expected bold move.\n\nThe result has been its two-to-five-day commitment time has been well received, and ShipMatrix data on millions of parcels shows that it now has on-time performance approaching the high-90% mark normally reserved for FedEx and UPS.\n\nAnd, if the Postal Service can rapidly complete the realignment of the Priority Mail (which is not a mail service so why not brand it as Priority Advantage?) parcel network so as to achieve on-time performance to match that of Ground Advantage and that of the deferred express services of FedEx and UPS, it will stand to gain market share.\n\nIn addition to the changes pushed by the Postal Service and Amazon, the parcel market for the first time since 1985 has seen the emergence of new parcel carriers like Axlehire and Veho, which are utilizing new approaches. Whether or not they succeed in gaining a large share of the market, they are challenging the 40-year-old narrative.\n\nWith UPS faced with high costs from a unionized labor contract and FedEx with the handling of an integration of Express and Ground networks, the timing could not be better for both to develop a parcel service that would meet the demands of customers and lower operating costs to fend of new competition from startup carriers and from Amazon’s new door-to-door offering. That offering seeks to leverage Amazon’s huge backhaul capacity at lower cost and higher service level with greater use of data analytics.\n\nWhile Amazon’s two-day and next-day delivery quickly became the standard copied by its competitors, at least two new online retailers are responding to new customer demands. Temu and Shein are showing that consumers do not need most items in one or two days and are willing to receive their orders within seven to 12 days for a comparable-quality product at a considerably lower price.\n\nSo, it is time for shippers to embrace carriers that are making changes to meet today’s market needs and regain control over their parcel spend, which increased dramatically during the pandemic as carriers suddenly took higher base rate increases and imposed new surcharges.\n\nSatish Jindel is president of ShipMatrix Inc. and a founding member of RPS (now FedEx Ground).\n\nThe post Parcel carriers still operating according to 1980s narrative appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "title": "Amazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says",
        "content": "Contract carriers such as Sun Country Airlines operate Boeing 737-800 freighters (pictured) for Amazon. The Amazon fleet also includes larger Boeing 767s and an Airbus A330. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nAmazon’s private cargo airline, Amazon Air, took a different approach with its North American and European networks during the past 12 months. It has been streamlining operations in the U.S. by prioritizing larger planes and major hubs, but relying less on hubs in Europe as flight activity decreases, according to a report published Thursday.\n\nThe air logistics unit’s meteoric growth has ended after seven years, but the company was able to maintain operating levels at a time when many cargo airlines, including FedEx and UPS, parked aircraft and reduced flights in response to the downturn in air cargo demand.\n\nPerhaps more noteworthy, Amazon Air (NASDAQ: AMZN) largely kept its fleet and flight schedule intact even as growth in e-commerce sales normalized and the mega-retailer shifted to a regional fulfillment model that decreases reliance on air transport.\n\nThe report from the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University described how Amazon has 4.6% more payload capacity than a year ago despite having one fewer plane. It has also mostly transitioned to a hub-and-spoke model that mirrors FedEx and UPS, with less point-to-point flying. While total daily flights fell by 1.8%, to 202 per day, Amazon Air’s available ton-miles grew.\n\nThe researchers, led by Chaddick Institute Director Joseph Schwieterman, relied on geospatial mapping with flight tracking data for their analysis.\n\nMore than four in five Amazon Air flights within the U.S. mainland operate to or from its five largest hubs, up from 65.6% in early 2021. Flight activity at four of its five busiest hubs, Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky (CVG), San Bernardino, California; Ohio’s Wilmington Air Park and Florida’s Lakeland-Linder all grew over the past year.\n\nOnly Fort Worth Alliance Airport in Texas diminished in flight activity, a result researchers attributed to Amazon’s decision to discontinue use of five ATR-72 turboprop aircraft operated by Silver Airways and which accounted for a tiny fraction of the terminal’s tonnage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon relies on partner carriers, such as Silver, to operate its network because it isn’t a pure airline with its own operating authority. Amazon’s active fleet has plateaued in the past 18 months at about 80 aircraft, according to various aircraft databases.\n\nLakeland is now Amazon’s second largest hub, with nearly 21 flights per day.\n\nThe Ohio Valley has become Amazon Air’s strategic center, accounting for more than half the flights in the U.S. mainland. Flights at CVG increased from 57.5 to 63.3 per day in the past 12 months, not including about six flights by unmarked partner carriers, according to the report. Wilmington Air Park, only 60 miles away, handles 20 flights per day. Concentrating flights at the Cincinnati hub, and clustering them into two tight arrival and departure blocks, allows for efficient plane-to-plane transfers that support overnight delivery\n\nAmazon Air still lags FedEx and UPS in proficiency, with turnaround times for aircraft of about five hours versus two to three hours for the integrated logistics providers, the Chaddick report said.\n\nDitching the small turboprops was one of several adjustments Amazon made to its freighter fleet to better align the network with consumer demand and the renewed emphasis on regional order fulfillment. E-commerce sales in 2023 increased 7.6% to $1.1 trillion – more than three times the rate of growth for total retail sales. Last year, online shopping accounted for 15.4% of total sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. After exploding 43% during the first year of the pandemic, annual e-commerce sales growth is expected to be less than 10% in the coming years.\n\nAmazon returned five Boeing 767-200 freighters because the lease expired and they were old. (It is scheduled to give back another seven 767-200s next month, the lessor recently said.) Meanwhile, Amazon added three 767-300 planes, all operated by contractor Air Transport International, and its first Airbus A330-300, operated by Hawaiian Airlines. In the process, the percentage of the fleet consisting of Boeing 737, or smaller planes, has fallen from 38% to 33% over the past year.\n\nAmazon has signed leases for nine more A330-300 converted freighters, which are larger than the 767 widebodies.\n\nThe Silver Airways freighters – and air service to Des Moines, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Wichita, Kansas – became expendable as Amazon moved to a fully regional, rather than national, fulfillment model. With orders distributed from eight regions, a good truck line haul can perform as well as aircraft in key city pairs at lower cost with little-to-no impact for customers in small markets, logistics experts say.\n\nIn its effort to simplify the U.S. network, Amazon Air also ended regular flights to Mobile, Alabama; San Jose, California; and Tampa, Florida. Tampa is less than an hour’s drive from Lakeland-Linder airport. The company also halved air service to Las Vegas, which is less than four hours by truck from its San Bernardino, California, hub and cut service by about a third at Baltimore-Washington airport, which is a 7.5 hour drive from the Wilmington, Ohio, hub.\n\nLast month, Amazon gave notice it is pulling out of San Antonio’s airport, closing on April 10. Amazon has air service to Austin, Texas, which is only an hour from San Antonio by truck. By April, Amazon will be in 47 U.S. airports, down from 53 last year.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon restructured fulfillment operations and transportation networks across the U.S., dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed the retailer to better utilize close-by inventory, reduced stops per package and decreased reliance on air transportation. Amazon says shortening the distance deliveries have to travel to reach customers and improving inventory placement has helped achieve the fastest-ever shipping speeds.\n\nAmazon always placed some inventory in regional warehouses to improve delivery times and reduce cost, according to a former Amazon executive who asked not to be named, but has now engineered its entire logistics network around that model. That means distribution centers have a limited mix of products available for same-day or next-day delivery. If a shopper, especially in a non-major metro area, wants a ruffled bed sheet instead of a standard one she may have to wait more than two days for it to be shipped from a larger distribution center further away.\n\nTrucks do well for short-and-medium lengths of haul to less populated areas because customers have learned to accept that a special delivery may take longer, or that the order cutoff time may be earlier for day-definite delivery, said a former Amazon executive. In this scenario, freighters become more of a luxury used to enhance customer satisfaction with a speedy delivery from one regional center to another when there is a mismatch in regional inventory levels. Amazon Air’s first Airbus A330 freighter, operated by Hawaiian Airlines, makes its first commercial flight from the airline’s main hub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport on Oct. 2, 2023. (Photo: Amazon)\n\n“I would argue that some of these 737s that they fly, say from Dallas to New Orleans, are not necessary because nothing you’re flying on short haul is profitable,” the individual said.\n\nThe report noted that Amazon is increasingly reluctant to deploy many flights at passenger-focused airports that are crowded and have limited room for warehouse expansion. Chicago-Rockford, Lehigh Valley airport in Pennsylvania and Sacramento airport in California have picked up flights while flights have diminished, or stayed flat, at Chicago O’Hare, New York John F. Kennedy and San Francisco airports.\n\nA Chaddick Institute report last August found that cargo-focused airports outside large metropolitan areas give freighter operators several advantages, including faster shipment discharge and developable land for cargo facilities.\n\nChanges to European network\n\nWhile Amazon Air slightly increased U.S. capacity and added a handful of daily flights in Canada and India, flight activity in Europe dropped by more than a third over the past year. That followed a 29% reduction in flights in 2022. Reductions included flights carried out by partner airlines using their own unbranded aircraft.\n\nLate last year, Amazon closed its regional air hub at Leipzig/Halle International Airport in Germany in response to a downturn in e-commerce sales and parcel volumes. Activity peaked in early 2022 at 18 flights per day, operated by contractor ASL Airlines Ireland using Boeing 737-800 converted freighters. All but one route was shifted to Hannover in northern Germany and Liege airport in Belgium. Leipzig now averages less than two Amazon flights per day.\n\nAmazon Air completely exited Germany’s Cologne/Bonn airport in late 2022 and has sharply cut back flights at two U.K. airports in the aftermath of Brexit.\n\nThe current network currently serves 10 airports, down from a high of 13 three years ago. More than 80% of Europe’s population remains within 300 miles of an Amazon Air airport. Such distances can be covered within a day on a truck, the report says.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe researchers, led by Chaddick Institute Director Joseph Schwieterman, predicted that in the next year Amazon Air will gradually begin to expand flight operations, mostly at its CVG national hub and four large regional hubs. By mid-2025, the combined daily flight activity at CVG and Wilmington will grow to more than 125, including partner flights, with CVG alone having at least 85. Non-hub flying will be simultaneously reduced.\n\nAmazon will remain relatively small in Europe, but it will grow again in a measured way, especially near where logistics infrastructure is being built, the report said. Potential growth areas include Scandinavia, Greece and the Balkan countries.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.\n\nContact Reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nPilots flying Amazon cargo say employer stalling contract talks\n\nAmazon’s largest cargo jet makes debut\n\nAmazon’s return of leased cargo jets hurts ATSG profit\n\nThe post Amazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into $1 Million (or More)",
        "content": "Are you thinking big? Like, really big? That is to say, are you looking to turn a tiny amount of money now into a seven-figure stash later?\n\nNever say never. Not only is it possible, it happens more often than you might think. The key is time and picking the right stock, of course, and then remaining patient enough to continue holding that ticker through the rough patches.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a look at three familiar stocks that turned a $1,000 investment into $1 million, if not more. Just be sure to read through the wrap-up that explains what you can learn from these three enormous winners to repeat the feat in the future.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't just a familiar modern-era winner. It's arguably the market's most memorable winner of all time! Shares are up more than 230,000% just since its 1997 initial public offering (IPO) at a split-adjusted price of $0.075. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth around $2.3 million today. That growth has also made Amazon one of the world's biggest companies, as measured by market cap.\n\nIt's not exactly a secret as to how it happened. Founder and longtime CEO Jeff Bezos saw an opportunity in the internet's infancy, viewing it as a convenience-providing platform where people would eventually do a great deal of their shopping. And he was right. The e-commerce giant alone accounts for over one-third of the United States' total e-commerce sales. That's bigger than the next nine e-commerce platforms combined.\n\nIt's not just an e-commerce giant anymore, though. It's also a cloud computing powerhouse. Amazon Web Services generated $90.8 billion worth of business last year, turning $24.6 billion of that revenue into operating profit. This arm now makes up roughly two-thirds of the company's entire bottom line. And again, it's a business built from scratch simply because Jeff Bezos saw a budding opportunity and acted.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Procter & Gamble\n\nTech-driven growth isn't the only path to riches, however. Consumer staples can do the job, too. Take Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) as an example. It, too, has made plenty of millionaires out of relatively small investors.\n\nOK, there are a couple of important footnotes to add here. One of them is that it's taken Procter & Gamble a lot longer to turn a $1,000 investment into $1 million ... several decades longer, to be clear. Second, reaching this seven-figure mark with P&G would have required reinvesting its dividends into more shares of the stock.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race, though.\n\nOf course, Procter & Gamble also had an unfair competitive advantage. It's owned market-leading brands ranging from Tide detergent to Crest toothpaste to Dawn dishwashing liquid for the decades in question. Not only is it easier to maintain a lead you already own, but being a market leader also provides leverage when it comes to keeping competitors in check and distribution partners in tow.\n\nRegardless of the reason, P&G has paid off for patient investors.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, technology giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has also minted many patient millionaires. The stock's present price of $175 is nearly 175,000% above its split-adjusted IPO price of $0.10 per share. A $1,000 investment in its 1980 IPO would now be worth just under $1.8 million.\n\nGranted, Apple's not been a red-hot winner for its entire existence. The company very nearly went bankrupt back in the late 1990s. It required a $150 million cash infusion from Microsoft and the rehiring of Steve Jobs as CEO to turn things around. And even then, things remained a little wobbly for years; the dot-com meltdown of 2000 certainly didn't help matters either. Apple shares didn't make any net progress during this turbulent time.\n\nRather, the bulk of the stock's enormous gain has taken shape since 2007, when the very first iPhone was released. It's not a stretch to suggest this incredibly popular smartphone, in fact, is the crux of the reason for the stock's incredible gains.\n\nWhatever the cause, congratulations to the people who understood what a game-changer the iPhone would end up being. It's not just the mobile phone all other phone makers are hoping to compete with. It mainstreamed the very idea of carrying around a web-connected mini-computer in your pocket.\n\n3 key takeaways for investors\n\nThe bad news is it's unlikely any of these three stocks can repeat the feat in the same amount of time they first turned $1,000 into $1 million (or more). All three companies are still outstanding. But circumstances were different when each stock began its heroic run-up.\n\nThe good news is, however, that the reasons Apple, Amazon, and P&G shares performed so well for so long are clear. Lots of other companies behind stocks that haven't yet dished such rallies exhibit these same qualities or soon will if they don't yet. Three of these attributes stand out above the rest.\n\nOne of these characteristics is a clear competitive advantage. For P&G, it was sheer size, which also ended up being the case for Amazon. For Apple, its edge was a superior product that other manufacturers would often imitate but would never successfully duplicate. Apple also benefited from the fact that it enjoyed complete control of the underlying digital ecosystem -- iOS, the App Store, and more -- that made its devices so functional.\n\nAnother somewhat related quality of these companies' businesses and core products is that each was and is future-proof. It's an overused example, but it still makes the point perfectly ... it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a way to circumvent the need for camera film, developing technology and at-home tools that could do the job just as well.\n\nConversely, the companies behind high-performance stocks aren't in jeopardy of becoming obsolete. Consumers will perpetually want newer, more powerful tech and will always want to shop. They'll also need to wash their clothes or brush their teeth. That's why you should be looking for companies that will remain relevant forever.\n\nFinally, bear in mind that at least two of these three companies -- Amazon and Apple -- seemed a little out of the ordinary at the time their stocks were getting started on their big gains. We now know they weren't odd, however. These companies were just ahead of their time. The market's next enormous winners will likely look similarly odd. Just look a the bigger picture, considering how consumers and corporations will see their solutions 10 and 20 years into the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For three decades, investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the face of the AI movement\n\nAlthough Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024.\n\nWhat's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January).\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold\n\nWhile some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.\n\nWhat's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander piled into the \"Magnificent Seven\" of AI stocks\n\nNo billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium's Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street's top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" components, including:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased\n\nThe \"why?\" behind these buys is simple: They're respective industry leaders. Alphabet's Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world's leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple's iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.\n\nBut these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers.\n\nApple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBillionaire Jeff Yass added shares of time-tested AI businesses that would be AI-bubble resistant\n\nThe second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased\n\nAs noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages.\n\nTesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen gobbled up AI ancillary stocks in place of Nvidia\n\nThe final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased\n\nSimilar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure.\n\nWestern Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate.\n\nCohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet Wall Street's Newest Stock-Split Stock, Along With the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Likeliest to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street. Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years. While most investors are probably hoping for an end to this pattern in 2024, it nevertheless speaks to the unpredictable nature of stocks over the short term.\n\nHistorically, when volatility and uncertainty crop up, professional and retail investors have a tendency to seek out companies that have consistently outperformed in virtually any economic climate. One perfect example of this is investors flocking to the FAANG stocks for more than a decade. But in recent years, it's stocks enacting splits that have been the cream of the crop. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count. It's cosmetic in the sense that a stock split doesn't change a company's market cap or its operating performance.\n\nA forward-stock split can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who don't have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Conversely, reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange. With few exceptions, investors tend to focus on high-flying businesses conducting forward-stock splits.\n\nNearly a dozen high-profile companies have enacted forward splits since mid-2021\n\nCompanies that enact forward splits are usually highly profitable and on the leading edge of the innovative curve within their respective industries.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, just shy of a dozen high-profile companies have completed forward-stock splits, including Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), and Walmart(NYSE: WMT). Amazon and Tesla conducted forward splits of 20-for-1 and 3-for-1 in 2022, respectively, while Walmart's 3-for-1 forward-stock split went into effect last month.\n\nStory continues AMZN Chart\n\nThe reason these businesses have outperformed is because of their well-defined competitive advantages:\n\nAmazon is an absolute juggernaut in e-commerce. The nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales it accounted for in 2023 was nearly six times more than Walmart, its next-closest competitor. Amazon is also the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's producing a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced just shy of 1.85 million EVs and will likely make a run at topping 2 million production vehicles this year. Walmart has been able to use its size as an advantage. Buying products in bulk helps to lower per-unit costs, which provides a competitive edge on price compared to most local stores and grocery chains. Meanwhile, the vastness of its stores and direct-to-consumer site encourages shoppers to stay within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 19, another top-notch company announced that it would joining this exclusive group of stock-split stocks. Image source: Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nMeet Wall Street's tasty new stock-split stock\n\nFollowing the closing bell on March 19, the board of directors of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) announced a 50-for-1 stock split, which is one of the largest forward splits in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Assuming the split is given the green light by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in June, Chipotle will begin trading at a post-split price on June 26, 2024.\n\nChipotle went public in January 2006 at an initial offering price of $22 per share, but has never split its stock. Shares of the company neared the $3,000 mark shortly after the announcement. A 50-for-1 stock split would reduce Chipotle's share price to just shy of $60 per share, based on where it's trading at the time of this writing.\n\nSaid Chipotle's chief financial and administrative officer, Jack Hartung,\n\nThis is the first stock split in Chipotle's 30-year history, and we believe this will make our stock more accessible to employees as well as a broader range of investors. This split comes at a time when our stock is experiencing an all-time high driven by record revenues, profits, and growth.\n\nInterestingly, Chipotle's desire to make shares more nominally affordable for its employees echoes what Walmart said when in late January when it announced its 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nChipotle's continued outperformance, which led to this monumental stock split, can be summed up by three catalysts: food quality, its menu, and innovation.\n\nWith regard to the former, Chipotle has strived to use locally sourced vegetables and responsibly raised meats. Just as grocery stores benefited from the organic food push two decades ago, Chipotle is enjoying exceptional pricing power and increased demand because of its use of fresh ingredients.\n\nSecondly, Chipotle tends to keep its menu relatively small. A small menu makes food preparation easier on its staff, which can expedite service times. A limited menu can also lead to more excitement when new food items are introduced.\n\nLastly, innovation has played an important role in the outperformance of Chipotle's stock. A perfect example is the introduction of \"Chipotlanes,\" which are drive-thru lanes specifically designed for mobile orders. Management has done a phenomenal job of improving the operating efficiency of its stores over time.\n\nThis skyrocketing artificial intelligence (AI) stock may split its shares next\n\nWith Walmart completing its split in late February and Chipotle Mexican Grill on track to conduct its first-ever split in late June, it's just a matter of time before another high-quality company joins this exclusive club of stock-split stocks. Given the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment, the likeliest candidate to follow in Chipotle's footsteps is semiconductor company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Did you think I was going to say Nvidia?\n\nBroadcom stock ended the trading session on March 19 at a whopping $1,238 per share. That's up more than 1,800% over the trialing decade. Although Broadcom conducted three stock splits prior to be acquired by Avago in early 2016 (Avago chose to keep the Broadcom name), Avago had never announced any stock splits.\n\nAI is a megatrend the likes of which we haven't seen since the advent of the internet. Though estimates are all over the place, researchers at PwC released a report last year that suggested AI could add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. That's music to the ears of Broadcom.\n\nBroadcom's operating performance is liable to be fueled by its Jericho3-AI chip, which the company introduced last spring. Jericho3 has the ability to connect up to 32,000 graphics processing units at once in AI-accelerated data centers. In other words, Broadcom boasts the critical infrastructure that'll be needed to support generative AI solutions and large language model training.\n\nIn addition to its undeniable AI ties, Broadcom's highly profitable foundation is its wireless chip segment. It's a leading provider of 5G wireless chips used in next-generation smartphones. A steady stream of consumers upgrading their wireless devices to take advantage of faster download speeds has led to a healthy backlog of orders for Broadcom.\n\nAlthough Avago's management team has never pulled the trigger on a stock split, a share price north of $1,200 may be the catalyst needed to make the company's stock more nominally affordable for everyday investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "30 Cities With The Highest Cost of Living",
        "content": "In this article, we will list 30 cities with the highest cost of living. If you want to skip our discussion about the cost of living in the United States, go to 11 Cities With The Highest Cost of Living.\n\nFebruary 2024 was yet another reminder that the recent rise in the cost of living is sticky and stubborn. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States climbed by 3.2% on a year-on-year basis in a month. Year-on-year basis CPI recorded in the month of January was 3.1%. This shows that the inflation rose by 0.4% on a month-on-month basis from January 2024 to February 2024, which was slightly higher than the 0.3% rise between December 2023 and January 2024. Excluding volatile components such as food and energy prices, core inflation paints a better picture. It reached 3.8% annually in February, showing a minor decrease of 0.1% from January, not accounting for food and energy prices. These rising prices are affecting Americans negatively as the cost of living is increasing every day. Goods that cost $100 before the pandemic are now worth more than $119.\n\nA survey by the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) highlighted that more than two-thirds of employees feel that inflation is rising faster than their wages and salaries. Companies are also feeling the pressure of ongoing price hikes and many are not able to cope with it. Even tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are taking steps to cut down costs. The company nearly doubled its budget for merit increases for certain employees in 2022. However, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held off raising the salaries of full-time employees in 2023. For that year, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) employees only got bonuses and stock awards.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) also slashed employee pay in Feb last year after a low sales forecast and a loss of market share. This reduction of pay of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) employees ranged between 5% to 25%, with the higher range of pay cuts reserved for higher executives, including the CEO. However, it is worth noting that these Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) pay cuts did not apply to hourly wage workers.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike the companies mentioned above, some like the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) worked towards easing the cost of living crisis for their workers. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) increased its minimum wage from $22 to $23 in September 2023 and announced to raise it further to $25 per hour by 2025.\n\nIn September 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) raised the salaries of its warehouse workers to $20.5 per hour, up from 19. However, this is not the first time in the last ten years that the company has raised its minimum wage. In fact, in 2018, it raised the minimum wage of its workers to $15, which was double the federal wage rate at the time. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been quite active over the last few years in making cost-of-living adjustments for its employees to meet the challenges associated with inflation.\n\nSince it is now clear that the current rise in consumer prices is sticky and stubborn, all eyes are now on the Federal Reserve. It is expected that the Fed will cut down interest rates this year but it had already said at the beginning of the year that it is in no hurry to do so. Inflation numbers are closely monitored by the Fed. It has been holding the Fed fund rate at a 23-year high to discourage spending and subdue high inflation. Currently, market predictions place a 70% chance of a rate cut by June 2024. This rate-cut decision by the Fed is anticipated by the whole world as interest rates in the United States affect the cost of living in the world.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 30 cities with the highest cost of living.  30 Cities With The Highest Cost of Living\n\nanekoho/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 30 cities with the highest cost of living we used cost of living indices by 3 sources. We selected the top 50 cities according to the cost of living from all three. For each city, we gave it points in reverse order. For example, if a city ranked first on one of the rankings, it got 50 points for that ranking. If a country ranked 50 for a particular ranking, it was given 1 point for that ranking. Then for each city, we totaled the scores and divided the sum by 3 to arrive at the Insider Monkey Cost of Living Index. The higher this score, the higher the cost of living in the city.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), extends its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with generative AI technology.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform, which was introduced at GTC 2024, will be available on AWS. Notably, the platform features GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink.\r\n\r\nThis will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs.\r\n\r\nApart from this, AWS intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU. These EC2 instances will feature the new B100 GPUs, which will be deployed in EC2 UltraClusters to accelerate generative AI training and inference.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Blackwell will be integrated with AWS Nitro System, Elastic Fabric Adapter encryption and AWS Key Management Service. This will help in providing end-to-end control of the training data and model weights.\r\n\r\nAlso, Amazon SageMaker will be integrated with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices as part of this collaboration to aid the price performance optimization of foundation models running on GPUs.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAWS Portfolio Strength, Competitive Scenario\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Amazon’s concerted efforts to expand the AWS portfolio, which has been driving its cloud customer momentum. Moreover, AWS's strength has been acting as a key catalyst behind Amazon’s growth. AMZN shares have returned 74.9% over a year.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’s solid customer base, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nAmazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. The Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s Growing Generative AI Efforts\n\nThe extended collaboration with NVIDIA is in sync with Amazon’s growing efforts toward bolstering its generative AI.\r\n\r\nAWS’s announcement regarding the general availability of its fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock, which provides seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.\r\n\r\nAWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s solidifying prospects in this promising market are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, AMZN crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nThe 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.\n\nShares of AMZN have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 5.3%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that AMZN could be poised for a continued surge.\n\nThe bullish case solidifies once investors consider AMZN's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 16 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.\n\nGiven this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on AMZN for more gains in the near future.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy Now With No Hesitation",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is roaring higher and earlier this year confirmed that we are in investors' favorite investment period: a bull market. This environment of expansion and optimism often boosts growth companies as well as companies that depend on the consumer. And we've seen plenty of them soar in recent times, leading the index's gains.\n\nIn some cases, you may hold off on investing in certain players that have climbed a lot in recent weeks or months. The risk is they may have become too expensive and could be ready for stagnation or declines. But in other cases, the recent increase may be just a taste of the company's long-term performance potential. That means investing right now is a great idea. Here are two soaring stocks that fit the bill, and that means I'd buy them today with no hesitation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Target\n\nTarget's (NYSE: TGT) earnings and share price suffered over the past two years as rising inflation weighed on the consumer's buying power. But the retailer relied on its strengths such as the importance of its stores in the fulfillment process and the popularity and high margins of its owned brands, just to mention two examples -- and Target launched an efficiency plan too.\n\nAbove all, Target has continued to focus on its long-term development, opening new stores and revamping others to keep customers loving the shopping experience.\n\nThe result? Target's most recent earnings report showed tremendous progress, with the company announcing full-year wins in many metrics. Cash from operations more than doubled year over year to $8.6 billion, the operating income margin rate of 5.3% was almost two percentage points higher than the previous year, and GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $8.94 both were about 50% higher than in 2022. Target also realized cost savings of more than $500 million.\n\nAll of this shows Target is heading for better days, and its stores should continue to drive growth. As chief executive officer Brian Cornell pointed out in the recent earnings call, the majority of U.S. shopping still happens in stores on any given day. Now Target trades for only 17 times forward earnings estimates, even after advancing 17% this year -- so this looks like a great time to get in on this top stock set to benefit as the U.S. consumer recovers and thrives over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) also went through a rough patch in recent years as higher inflation hurt the consumer and made the company's operations more expensive too. But Amazon revamped its cost structure, an effort that has already been bearing fruit and should continue to boost earnings down the road.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, the e-commerce giant reported net sales that climbed in the double digits, and operating income more than quadrupled. This is thanks to the company's growth in e-commerce, of course, but also thanks to its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In fact, historically, AWS has driven profit at Amazon, and this trend looks set to continue. AWS generated $7.1 billion in operating income in the quarter, representing 54% of total Amazon operating income.\n\nAmazon also is benefiting from its investment in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). The company uses AI to streamline operations, saving time and money and keeping customers happy as it delivers packages faster. And AWS sells a wide variety of AI services to customers, from chips and coding companions to a fully managed service that allows clients to tailor top large language models to their needs.\n\nAmazon, after rising 15% so far this year, trades for 41 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 56 just a few months ago. And that's a bargain for a company that has what it takes to benefit during a bull market and over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Target right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Target, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Led the First Phase of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but These 2 Growth Stocks Will Lead the Next Phases, According to a Wall Street Team",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has undoubtedly led the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its share price soared 245% over the past year as businesses clamored to buy its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become synonymous with AI. But analysts at Goldman Sachs see Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as a leader in the second and fourth phases of AI, and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) as a leader in the third phase.\n\nThe four phases are detailed below. Investors should not think of them as distinct events, but rather as a continuum where a new phase can begin well before the previous one has ended. In other words, all four periods will overlap to some degree.\n\nPhase 1: Semiconductor companies will generate revenue from chips designed to support AI workloads. Phase 2: Cloud businesses will produce revenue by providing access to AI infrastructure. Phase 3: Cloud companies will generate revenue by incorporating AI into software and services. Phase 4: Many different kinds of organizations will use AI internally to improve operational efficiency.\n\nThe Goldman analyst team has made sensible selections. Amazon is the largest cloud services provider in the world and the company is already using AI to make its logistics business more efficient. Similarly, Cloudflare has a substantial opportunity to monetize AI through its Workers developer platform, so much so that management believes it could be a leader in AI inferencing.\n\nRead on to find out why both stocks could be worthwhile long-term investments.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is best known for its e-commerce empire. The company operates the most visited online marketplace in the world, and it has reinforced its leadership position by investing heavily in logistics capabilities. That strategy not only allows Amazon to control costs, but also enables the company to support sellers with fulfillment services and delight buyers with timely delivery.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has used its dominance in online retail to create a thriving advertising business. In fact, Amazon has become the third-largest adtech company in the world, and Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt believes it \"is well positioned to continue taking share of global digital advertising spending over a multi-year period.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top dog in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several subcategories of the cloud computing market. Most notably, consultancy Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) developer services.\n\nAmazon looked strong in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion due to momentum in e-commerce and advertising, as well as a sequential acceleration in cloud computing revenue. Meanwhile, GAAP net income reached $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year, indicating that cost-control efforts are paying off.\n\nLooking ahead, AI should be a tailwind for Amazon, both in terms of improving efficiency and boosting revenue. For instance, the company is using machine learning to optimize inventory and delivery routes. That should support continued margin expansion, especially in conjunction with its new regional fulfillment strategy, which reduced shipping costs on a per-unit basis in 2023 for the first time since 2018, according to CEO Andy Jassy.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon recently introduced Bedrock, a cloud service for building generative AI applications. The company also announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant. Both products create new monetization opportunities that should help Amazon tap growing demand for AI. Indeed, Jassy believes investments in AI will \"drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow revenue by 11% annually over the next five years. That estimate makes its current valuation of 3.2 times sales seem reasonable, though it is a slight premium to the three-year average of 2.9 times sales.\n\nI think Goldman has the right idea where Amazon is concerned. Patient investors should consider buying a few shares of this top AI stock today.\n\n2. Cloudflare\n\nCloudflare provides application, network, and security services that improve the performance of corporate infrastructure and software across public clouds and private data centers. Additionally, the company offers compute and storage services through its Workers developer platform that help businesses build and deploy applications, and it has been particularly focused on enabling artificial intelligence.\n\nLast year, CEO Matthew Prince said, \"By our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across leading AI start-ups.\" He also stated that the company was \"uniquely positioned to become a leader in AI inferencing.\" Prince was referring to Workers AI, a recently launched service that lets businesses run AI applications on Nvidia GPUs installed across its network.\n\nCloudflare operates the fastest cloud network on the market, and Forrester Research recently recognized the company as the leader in edge development platforms. Those qualities could indeed help Cloudflare become a major player in the AI inferencing market, despite tough competition from Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nCloudflare reported strong fourth-quarter financial results. Its customer count climbed 17% and the average existing customer spent 15% more over the past year. In turn, revenue increased 32% to $362 million in the fourth quarter, and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to $53 million. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue\n\nGoing forward, Grand View Research believes the edge computing market will grow by 37% annually through 2030, and Cloudflare is poised to capitalize on that opportunity given its strong position in edge development platforms. But the International Data Corp. has also ranked Cloudflare as a leader in zero-trust network access, and that market is forecast to expand by 17% annually through 2030.\n\nCollectively, Cloudflare has a good shot at 20% annual revenue growth through the end of the decade, and that estimate could be conservative depending on how well the company monetizes AI. Either way, its present valuation of 23.7 times sales is tolerable. To be clear, that multiple is not cheap, so shares will almost certainly be volatile. But patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in this growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed the latest trading day at $175.90, indicating a +0.81% change from the previous session's end. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.57%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.83%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.39%.\n\nThe online retailer's shares have seen an increase of 2.93% over the last month, surpassing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.73% and falling behind the S&P 500's gain of 2.97%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Amazon will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.81, reflecting a 161.29% increase from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $142.42 billion, showing a 11.83% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $4.08 per share and a revenue of $641.36 billion, signifying shifts of +40.69% and +11.58%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Amazon. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 1.22% upward. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note Amazon's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 42.74. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 20.\n\nInvestors should also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.52 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.59.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 90, placing it within the top 36% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Dividend payments continue to be hugely important to investors, both as a source of income and as a means of growing their portfolios. And dividend payments are growing. In 2023, dividend payments around the world hit a record $1.7 trillion, according to a report from British asset manager Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG). Data shows that dividend payouts rose 5% year-over-year in 2023, with the fourth quarter seeing a 7.2% increase from the previous third quarter.\n\nWhile dividends have been moving upward overall, many companies issued large dividend cuts or held their payouts to shareholders steady last year. In all, 86% of publicly traded companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at current levels in 2023. The other 14% lowered or eliminated their dividend, hurting their stock in the process. Investors may want to dump these three dividend stocks now.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) began the year by cutting its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by nearly 50%. Walgreens said that it is lowering its dividend payout to 25 cents per share from 48 cents previously, a reduction of 48%. The company said the dividend cut was being made to help “strengthen its long-term balance sheet and cash position.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalgreens’ dividend yield still looks strong at 4.81%. But don’t be fooled. The company, and WBA stock, are in terrible shape. The dividend yield has been rising as the company’s share price has been declining. Year-to-date, Walgreens’ share price has fallen 22%. Through five years, the stock is down 67%. The situation is bad enough that WBA stock was recently removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nLegacy telecommunications company AT&T (NYSE:T) also famously cut its dividend payout to stockholders by nearly 50% in 2022. At that time, AT&T CEO John Stankey said the dividend cut would free up cash that could be used to boost the company’s financial results. Well, that certainly hasn’t happened. AT&T most recently reported weak fourth-quarter 2023 financial results and issued soft forward guidance.\n\nT stock continues to perform poorly. Flat on the year, AT&T’s share price is down 7% over the last 12 months and has declined 26% in the past five years. A current dividend yield of 6.44% might look enticing to investors, but it’s a trap. The company continues to be dragged down by its wireline (landline phone) segment, which most recently posted a 10.3% sales decline in Q4 2023 from a year ago.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIn February 2023, chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) cut its quarterly dividend payment from 36.5 cents per share to 12.5 cents, a decrease of 66%. The dividend remains at the same level today, offering shareholders a tepid yield of just 1.17%. However, as disappointing as the dividend payment from Intel has become, it’s a bright spot compared to the performance of the company’s stock.\n\nThis year, INTC stock is down 11%. The company’s shares are trading 20% lower today than where they were five years ago. The decline comes as Intel continues to report hit-and-miss financial results and runs into roadblocks with its efforts to pivot to becoming a microchip foundry rather than a chip designer. In February of this year, Intel announced a delay in the construction of a new $20 billion manufacturing plant in Ohio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "I was there for the dot-com bust. Here's why the AI boom isn't the same.",
        "content": "The booming prices of artificial intelligence stocks have some obvious parallels with the dot-com bubble that inflated the stock market to outrageous highs in 1999 and 2000. Parallels that make some investors nervous today.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from Bank of America, 40% of fund managers think AI stocks are in a bubble (45% say no, and 15% don't know).\n\nBut as someone for whom the dot-com bubble was current events rather than history, I can tell you that today’s market isn’t remotely like the dot-com bubble market was.\n\nHow can I say such a thing?\n\nIt’s because the investing world has changed fundamentally from what it was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nBack then, besotted people (I wouldn’t call them investors) paid whatever the market was asking for ridiculously priced stocks like Pets.com, Boo.com, and Webvan, which ultimately croaked and left shareholders with nothing.\n\nWhy were people loading up with individual stocks? The fear of missing out on the internet wave certainly kept people piling money onto the table as they looked to quintuple their money. But the main reason was that back in 2000, people simply didn’t invest like they do now, as broad-based index funds were pretty much nonexistent compared to today.\n\nSo people who had bought into the dot-com hype — and there were plenty of them — mostly bought individual stocks.\n\nThese days, people talk — mistakenly, in my opinion — about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) being in a bubble, given the concentration of a handful of stocks powering the index. Back then, the Nasdaq market was the hot thing. And boy, did that bubble burst. Pets.com, the leading online pet retailer, announced Nov. 7, 2000, that it was closing down and laying off more than 250 of its 320 employees after being unable to find a purchaser or a financial backer for the company. (Newsmakers) (Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nOne of the most bubbly events took place on Jan. 10, 2000. That’s when Gerald Levin had Time Warner, the media and entertainment company that he was running, do the dumbest deal in history: selling itself to America Online in return for AOL stock, which was a dot-com megabubble.\n\n(You may have read about this deal lately because Levin died last week and many obituaries mentioned his AOL debacle.)\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo months after the Time Warner-AOL deal was announced — on Mar. 10, 2000 — the Nasdaq, which had more than doubled from a year earlier, hit its closing peak of 5,048.62.\n\nThen the slide began. And kept on going. And going. And going.\n\nUltimately, the Nasdaq bottomed out at 1,114.11 on Oct. 9, 2002. That was 78% below its high. It didn’t score another new high until April 23, 2015 — more than 15 years after the previous peak.\n\nEven one of the high-quality companies that survived the bubble — Cisco Systems — hasn’t been a great investment. It was recently trading for about 30% less than it fetched on Peak Bubble Day.\n\nBarring a totally unforeseen catastrophe, can you see the S&P losing 78% of its value in a little over two and a half years from now? I sure can’t see that happening. Especially given the trillions of dollars currently sloshing around in S&P index funds, with more money flowing in on a regular basis from employers and employees participating in benefit plans and from institutional investors such as pension funds for whom the S&P is a benchmark.\n\nBut, you say, what about the Magnificent Seven tech companies whose stocks more than doubled last year and drove the S&P to new high after new high?\n\nThe S&P’s total return — price increases plus reinvested dividends — for the year was 26.3%. Doesn’t this mean that we’re in a bubble?\n\nI don’t think so. Among the reasons is that even though the Seven were incredibly hot, the other S&P companies — let’s call them the Non-Magnificent 493 — had a total return of 9.9%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s about the average return the US market has shown over the long term. The Pets.com sock puppet dog stars in a commercial for the company in Los Angeles, Jan. 11, 2000. (Bob Riha/Liaison/Getty Images) (Bob Riha Jr. via Getty Images)\n\nAmazingly, this year’s market, despite a recent decline, is on track to outperform last year’s market. The S&P had returned 7.28% through Friday’s close, according to Silverblatt. Extrapolate that 2.5-month return to a full year and you get 34.9%.\n\nAnd now, some of last year’s Magnificent Seven are having a less-than-magnificent 2024. Tesla (TSLA) was down 34.2% as of Friday’s close — the worst performer in the S&P, according to Silverblatt.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) accounted for 32% of the S&P’s gain this year, he says, with Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) accounting for another 28%. Apple (AAPL), however, is down for the year, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) has only a marginal gain. (So perhaps we should rename the Magnificent Seven the Fab Four?)\n\nThe point here is that it doesn’t seem very bubbly when three of the Magnificent Seven aren’t doing well and yet the S&P keeps chugging along.\n\nLook. I’m not telling you that the market is any sort of bargain these days — it’s not cheap by any standard. And I’m not telling you that it’s not going to decline, possibly sharply, over the mid- to long-term.\n\nBut what I am telling you is that there’s a big difference between a high-priced market like today’s and an insanely priced market like the Nasdaq was in the dot-com bubble days.\n\nThere may be some difficult times ahead for investors.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the music streaming market space. Per a Grand View Research report, the global music streaming market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company added a song search capability for YouTube Music on Android devices.\r\n\r\nNotably, YouTube Music now features a dedicated button next to voice search, allowing faster access by tapping the search icon in the top-right corner.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is likely to expand its YouTube Music subscriber base on the back of its latest move.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nYouTube Music in Focus\n\nApart from the song search feature, Google introduced a \"Trim Silence\" feature in the v6.43.52 version of YouTube Music, allowing users to skip past stretches of silence in a podcast, resulting in a slightly shorter runtime.\r\n\r\nFurther, the company announced a redesign of the Now Playing feature on YouTube Music for web, introducing a full-screen experience with a Song and Video switcher, minimize button, overflow menu and cast controls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Google added several new notifications for YouTube Music on Android and iOS, alerting users about new releases and playlists.\r\n\r\nThese notifications include music recommendation notifications, playlist update notifications, podcast recommendation notifications, product update notifications and recap notifications. Users can disable these notifications in their preferences at any time.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors to enhance YouTube Music offerings will likely aid Alphabet to bolster its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth driver for the company. Its shares have rallied 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 44.6%.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $286.52 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition\n\nGrowing YouTube Music efforts will likely allow Alphabet to strengthen its competitive position against rivals like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN, which are also making substantial efforts to strengthen their footing in the global music streaming space.\r\n\r\nRecently, Apple offered USHER fans exclusive content on Apple Music ahead of his upcoming Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show. The content includes a trailer, studio album discography, playlists curated by USHER and NFL teams, and dedicated Apple Music Radio programming for Apple Music subscribers.\r\n\r\nApple also launched a Discovery Station for Apple Music. The Discovery Station, available on Apple Music's mobile, desktop and web apps, is a curated selection of music based on users’ recent listening, which has not yet been added to the library.\r\n\r\nAmazon, on the other hand, is riding on the success of its music streaming service, Amazon Music.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Amazon Music Unlimited service offers an expanded catalog and over 1,000 spatial remixes for Dolby Atmos soundbars, Android and iOS devices, and Amazon Echo Studio.\n\nZacks Rank & A Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is CrowdStrike CRWD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of CrowdStrike have gained 28.7% in the year-to-date period.

        "title": "YouTube’s biggest star MrBeast is offering $5m to contestants in the ‘largest game show in history’ on Amazon Prime: ‘They’ll let me do whatever I want’",
        "content": "The most popular YouTuber in the world is bringing his brand of viral content to Amazon Prime to create the world’s largest game show ever made.\n\nJimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, boasts 245 million subscribers and many more casual viewers that tune in to watch challenges like “I paid a real assassin to try to kill me” or “Stop this train, win a Lamborghini” that typically cost a seven-digit figure to make.\n\nIn a podcast on Monday, Donaldson said there were only two stipulations both parties agreed to for the new show—it needed to have the most contestants ever as well as boast the biggest cash prize in history. And no expense would be spared.\n\n“Every episode is going to be like our biggest YouTube video ever,” he told popular creator news channel Colin and Samir. “Money is not a constraint.”\n\nThat’s saying something because his 20-minute videos currently cost upwards of $3.5 million each just to make, according to Donaldson, with some running as high as $5 million when everything is included.\n\nBig news gamers I’m going to be filming the largest game show in history and releasing it on Prime Video! Over 1,000 contestants, $5,000,000 prize, and many other world records.. I’ll reveal more later this year but let’s just say, it’s gonna be an insane show :D\n\n— MrBeast (@MrBeast) March 18, 2024\n\nThe YouTube personality wouldn’t reveal much about the show’s concept lest some clever contestants gain an edge, but he was already finished scripting, and filming is due to start in a couple of months.\n\nStakes high to prove a YouTuber can cross into mainstream\n\nAll told, Donaldson expects at least 10 episodes and more than six hours of content that would likely air either in November or December. Beforehand, Donaldson expects to post a prelude to the first episode on his channel so people can see for themselves whether it’s worth their time.\n\nStory continues\n\n“With that much effort I am putting into this I need everyone to watch it—I am going all out,” he explained.\n\nThe stakes are high for the 25-year-old to prove he can flourish beyond the confines of social media and attract viewers from all backgrounds and walks of life.\n\nHe said he was all too aware of the challenges and prejudices he and other content creators faced every time they sought to expand into the mainstream, particularly when it came to interference by media executives who insisted on always having the final say.\n\n“It could either have a massive positive effect and every streaming platform is going to be throwing deals left and right at creators, or a negative effect and people are going to go ‘if Jimmy couldn’t make a hit show, what makes you think you can?’,” he said. “And that is one of my biggest fears.”\n\nThat’s why, despite already having proved his ideas work on YouTube, Donaldson said one condition was particularly important for him from the outset.\n\n'They let me do whatever I want'\n\n“Let’s just say Amazon will give us the most creative control,” he said, “and by ‘most’ I mean 'all.'” His viewers after all are accustomed to nothing less.\n\nAmazon Prime Video has been on a mission to grab viewers from dominant rival Netflix. Yet while shows like The Boys and Reacher have enjoyed success, its lavishly expensive tentpole J.R.R. Tolkien epic The Rings of Powerflopped.\n\nBut that won’t stop the deep-pocketed tech giant from paying top dollar for new content, reportedly agreeing to distribute Donaldson’s game show for the price of $100 million. And unlike the demands of its rivals, no strings were attached.\n\n“They’ll let me do whatever I want, and other platforms didn’t,” he said.\n\nDonaldson assuaged fans that the six-hour show wouldn’t distract from his day job as a YouTuber, however. He plans to upload more videos to his main channel this year than last.\n\n“I don’t want it to mess with the YouTube channel in any way,” he said. “That has always been my number one priority and always will be, because at the end of the day we get 200 million views a video and that’s why I’m able to do all this other stuff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Says ‘Buy AI Beneficiaries Beyond the High Momentum Stocks’; Here Are 3 Names to Consider",
        "content": "The first quarter is almost behind us, and analysts are starting to discern the patterns that are shaping the year’s stock markets. Two key points are already standing out. One is the high levels of market concentration; the Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech firms are still soaking up a disproportionate share of the gains. The second, related to this, is a need to diversify – but to choose the diversification carefully.\n\nInvestors can’t rely on a general broadening of the market to lift a portfolio. Rather, what’s needed is a particular sector that will bring new opportunities by building on the Mag 7s’ existing gains. AI stocks fit this bill.\n\nWe all know how AI tech is altering the digital landscape. Writing from Goldman Sachs, chief US equity strategist David Kostin has some insight on the ways that AI will broaden investors’ options through the rest of this year: “US equity market concentration has jumped to the highest level in decades. While anxious investors have focused on the DotCom bust in 2000, other concentrated markets in the past 100 years often ended in ‘catch up’ rallies as the market broadened. Neither a ‘catch up’ nor a ‘catch down’ look very likely to us in the near-term in the absence of a major shift in interest rates or a deterioration in the outlook for mega-cap earnings.”\n\n“AI has captured investor enthusiasm, but that trade appears to be broadening,” goes on to add. “Stocks in Phase 2 (AI infrastructure) and Phase 3 (AI-enabled revenues) have recently outperformed peers, and we eventually expect Phase 4 will capture those firms best positioned to enjoy increased productivity.”\n\nFollowing this, Goldman’s stock analysts are telling us to ‘buy the AI beneficiaries beyond the high momentum stocks,’ and are specifically pointing out these 3 names for investors to consider. With help from the TipRanks database, we can also gauge general Street sentiment toward these names.\n\nPinterest(PINS)\n\nFirst on our Goldman-backed list is Pinterest, the visually oriented social media platform that gives users an online bulletin board to display graphic content in the online social universe. Pinterest follows the usual social media model, with users publishing and sharing content, either publicly or privately. The graphic-based platform, which also supports video content, lets users sort their digital bulletin boards into categories, making it easier for viewers to find and browse the pages. The visual orientation of the Pinterest platform has lent itself to e-commerce, and users can set up their pages as online storefronts. Pinterest has invested heavily in AI technology, using it to power the search function, and to sort and curate users’ pins and posts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a social platform, Pinterest skews both young and female. The user base is approximately 60% women, and the 18 to 25 age demographic is the platform’s fastest growing. The company does not explicitly market itself to young women, but management can’t avoid catering to the platform’s largest audience – in June of 2022, the company  acquired THE YES, an AI online shopping platform, for $87.6 million. The move expanded Pinterest’s capabilities in online commerce, and its appeal to its young and female core demographic.\n\nPinterest has seen recent strong gains in its user base. In the 4Q23 report, the last released, Pinterest reported 498 million global monthly active users (MAUs) as of December 31, 2023. This was up 11% year-over-year, and was an all-time high for the company.\n\nFor the full-year 2023, Pinterest had $3.055 billion in revenues, up 9% y/y; for Q4, the top line of $981 million was up 12% y/y – although it missed the forecast by $9.2 million. At the bottom line, Pinterest had non-GAAP earnings of 53 cents per share, a solid y/y gain from the 29 cents reported in 4Q22, and 2 cents per share better than had been expected.\n\nAll of this caught the eye of Goldman’s 5-star analyst Eric Sheridan, who took the measure of Pinterest’s activities, and came down with a bullish viewpoint: “In our view, PINS mgmt remains focused on building scale into a wider pool of ad budgets (advertiser diversity, new product iteration and better monetization of intent signals) to drive an improved revenue trajectory in the quarters and years ahead. In terms of margin structure, Q4 Adj EBITDA results continued to demonstrate how prior period investments are now building into forward year margin trajectory. Looking beyond the short-term narratives on rate of change in ad revenue growth rates in the coming quarters, we have a rising confidence interval in PINS mgmt long-term initiatives (shopping/commerce, depth of engagement across media types, international monetization, etc.) which would produce sustained above-industry average revenue growth over the next 2-3 years.”\n\nSumming up, Sheridan gives PINS a Buy rating, with a $41 price target that points toward a 20.5% gain in the coming months. (To watch Sheridan’s track record, click here)\n\nOverall, Pinterest has a Moderate Buy rating from the consensus of the Wall Street analysts, based on 30 recent reviews with a 21 to 9 breakdown of Buy vs Hold. The shares are trading for $33.98 and their $42.90 average price target is slightly more bullish than the Goldman view, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 26%. (See Pinterest’s stock forecast)\n\nCoupang(CPNG)\n\nNext on our list is the Korean e-commerce player Coupang, a strong market leader in the Asian country’s online retail sector. Coupang aims to ‘wow’ its customers, and offers an e-commerce platform on which customers can buy virtually anything. The company  also provides home delivery services, and even an online streaming service, Coupang Play. The breadth of products and services, and the guaranteed delivery, have led some to call the company ‘South Korea’s Amazon.’\n\nThe online service is complemented by a network of physical infrastructure, designed to facilitate the company’s warehousing and delivery services. Coupang has over 100 fulfillment centers, based on the Amazon model, housing its products and totaling more than 47 million square feet. The warehouse and logistic network is dense; it’s estimated that 70% of South Korea’s population lives within 7 miles of a Coupang facility.\n\nAlong with the warehouse network, the company uses top-end software systems, including AI-powered machine learning, to back up the e-commerce side and coordinate the physical deliveries. The software systems can predict demand spikes, route products into the delivery network, and ensure efficient handling of all orders, so that customers have more choices at a lower cost.\n\nIn an interesting development, Coupang in January completed its acquisition of the online luxury retailer Farfetch. Farfetch, which is based in the UK, provides a worldwide customer base with access to a wide range of luxury goods. Coupang acquired the company for $500 million, a surge in capital for Farfetch, that will allow the company to continue serving its 4-million-strong customer base. Coupang will also make its logistic expertise available to the new acquisition – and will gain access to Farfetch’s product lines of luxury goods and its worldwide presence.\n\nTurning to financial results, we find that Coupang reported revenues of $6.56 billion in 4Q23, for a 23% year-over-year gain. The quarterly top line also came in $150 million above the forecast. At the bottom line, the company had a non-GAAP EPS of 8 cents per share, 2 cents ahead of the pre-release estimates. Coupang complemented this quarterly performance with solid cash generation; for the full year 2023, the company reported $2.7 billion in operating cash flow and $1.8 billion in free cash flow.\n\nEric Cha follows Coupang for Goldman Sachs, and reiterates his belief that investors are not appreciative enough of CPNG’s benefits. He writes, “We maintain our positive view on the stock: We note some market concerns on potential overhang from selling by large shareholders (as seen post prior quarterly results), but we continue to be positive on fundamentals given Coupang’s differentiated moat driving multi-year market share gain momentum in the domestic retail space. Coupled with scale-driven operating leverage and GMV mix shift towards more profitable business model (i.e. FLC), we expect substantial scaling of FCF for the company, which we believe is still being under-appreciated.”\n\nThese comments support Cha’s Buy rating here, and his price target, set at $30, implies a gain of 64.5% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Cha’s track record, click here)\n\nOnce again, we’re looking at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating – this one derived from an even split of 3 Buys and Holds, each. The shares have a trading price of $18.23, and the $21.10 average target price indicates potential for a 16% one-year upside. (See Coupang’s stock forecast)\n\nAmazon(AMZN)\n\nLast on our list is Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of online commerce. Amazon is a company that has proven itself capable of rolling with whatever changes the market can throw at it. It survived the original dot.com bubble, it has expanded far beyond its origin as an online bookstore, and it has become the largest online retailer in the world, offering an unmatched line of products and acquiring a truly global reach.\n\nAs a result of becoming the world’s leader in online retail, Amazon has also become one of the world’s most valuable publicly traded companies. Amazon is one of the Magnificent 7 mega-cap stocks, and with its $1.81 trillion market cap, it is the fourth-largest public company on Wall Street. Amazon’s sheer scale is visible in another number, its daily sales volume of approximately $1.4 billion.\n\nLike Coupang above, Amazon has a widespread network of brick-and-mortar fulfillment centers, warehouses, and logistic hubs to support its e-commerce business. The company boasts that it can guarantee rapid delivery nearly anywhere on the globe, and the warehouse network is geared to provide that. Some of Amazon’s facilities have more than 1 million square feet of workspace, giving the company a solid physical presence that brings the online world to life.\n\nThe e-commerce side of Amazon’s business is huge, and attracts some 2 billion monthly hits to the company’s website. And attracting customers is the bread and butter of Amazon’s business, especially when online retail can be seen as a lure. The company  offers an array of additional services, available online, that more and more customers are finding that they cannot do without.\n\nThese services include cloud computing, the popular AWS that is available by subscription purchase, as well as TV streaming, the Kindle ebooks, online gaming for all ages, home automation, and even home delivery for online grocery orders. Amazon’s various services all combine to meet a common need, of solving customer problems in the real world.\n\nSolving those customer problems has been lucrative for Amazon. In early February, the company reported its results for 4Q23, and showed $170 billion in revenue for the quarter. This was up 14% year-over-year, and was $3.74 billion ahead of the estimates. At the bottom line, Amazon generated $1 in EPS from its $10.6 billion net income. AWS, the cloud computing service that has proven so popular, generated $24.2 billion of the total revenue, for a 13% y/y segment gain.\n\nWe’ll check in again with Goldman’s Eric Sheridan, who sees Amazon as a long-term stock play, writing of the company, “Looking over a multi-year timeframe, we reiterate our view that Amazon will compound a mix of solid revenue trajectory with expanding margins as they deliver yield/returns on multiple year investment cycles. After trading in a range (& underperforming the broader market) for most of the past 2-3 years, we see AMZN as well positioned for future outperformance as eCommerce margins continue a trajectory of scaling over headwinds created in recent years and ongoing benefits from a more efficient logistics network, as its advertising business continues to achieve scale and as AWS can still benefit from a long-tailed structural growth opportunity in the shifting needs of enterprise customers (while producing a balance of growth and margins).”\n\nFollowing the Q4 print, Sheridan summed up his stance on the stock with an upbeat outlook, saying, “…we continue to see Amazon positioned as a leader in all aspects of secular growth within our Internet coverage (eCommerce, digital advertising, media consumption, aggregated subscription offerings & cloud computing). In total, every key metric that Amazon is measured against exceeded expectations and we come away from this earnings report with an increased confidence interval in our medium/long term thesis of Amazon’s key platform drivers.”\n\nThe top-rated analyst gives AMZN a Buy rating, and he backs that up with a $220 price target suggesting a 26% share appreciation this year.\n\nAmazon’s stock has 41 unanimously positive analyst reviews, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target price of $209.23 implies that AMZN has a one-year potential upside of $20%.

        "title": "Amazon workers at UK warehouse strike again over pay, union recognition",
        "content": "By James Davey\n\nLONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Around 1,400 workers at an Amazon warehouse in Coventry, central England, went on strike on Tuesday and plan to do so again on Wednesday as part of a long-running dispute over pay and union recognition, the GMB trade union said.\n\nBritain has seen wider industrial unrest over the last two years as employees demand better wage rises to help offset high inflation. Amazon employs 75,000 in the UK, making the U.S. retail giant one of the UK's top ten private-sector employers.\n\nAmazon's preference is to resolve issues with employees directly rather than through unions.\n\nThe latest Coventry strike comes a week after GMB members at the Amazon site submitted an application for mandatory union recognition to the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC).\n\nIf the CAC, an independent body with statutory powers, finds that more than half the Amazon workers at Coventry are GMB union members, Amazon would formally have to recognise the union - a first for the company in Europe.\n\nIf the CAC rules the union has over 40% of the workforce but less than 50%, a vote will be held on recognising the union.\n\nWorkers at the Coventry site first went on strike in January last year.\n\nThe company has been feeling the pinch of unionisation efforts globally. In 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in New York City voted to form the first union at the company.\n\nThe workers walked out of the U.S. retail giant's Coventry site from 0630 GMT to 0830 GMT and will down tools again between 1730 GMT and 1930 GMT - with plans to repeat the walkout at the same times on Wednesday. Employees at Amazon's Birmingham office plan strike action on March 27 and 28.\n\nOn salary, an Amazon spokesperson said the company regularly reviewed pay \"to ensure we offer competitive wages and benefits.\"\n\nThe spokesperson noted its minimum starting pay will, in April, increase to 12.30 pounds ($15.58) and 13 pounds per hour depending on location - a 20% increase over two years and 50% since 2018.\n\n($1 = 0.7893 pounds) (Reporting by James Davey Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

        "title": "This Is the Cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, According to Peter Lynch's Favorite Valuation Metric",
        "content": "There's been a lot of talk about the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks recently. These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.\n\nAnd of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.\n\nOverall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "15 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the cryptocurrency industry, head directly to 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant turnaround from the losses of 2022 and 2023, with a notable rise driven by Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price has been steadily climbing since October 2023 and is currently approaching its previous record levels from late 2021. The surge in prices suggests that the cryptocurrency market may be on track to set new records this year. The key question now is whether this trend signifies a sustained bull market in cryptocurrencies or a short-lived surge. This upward trend follows a surge of interest from retail investors in spot Bitcoin ETFs. For instance, on March 4 alone, net inflows into the US-based Bitcoin ETFs reached approximately $562 million, as reported by Cointelegraph.\n\nThe rising popularity of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum is anticipated to drive market growth in the coming years. People in developed nations are increasingly embracing the convenient and flexible nature of digital transactions offered by these currencies. This surge in virtual currency usage has prompted central banks to show support for digital currencies. Additionally, digital currencies often leverage blockchain technology to achieve decentralization and facilitate efficient transactions, which are fast, transparent, secure, and reliable. Companies are capitalizing on these advantages by investing in cryptocurrency and forming partnerships to enhance services for users. For example, in October 2018, the Qtum Chain Foundation, based in Singapore, collaborated with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Amazon Web Services China to deploy blockchain systems on the Amazon Web Services cloud. This strategic partnership aimed to simplify the development and deployment of smart contracts for AWS users using Amazon Machine Images.\n\nStory continues\n\nA recent report suggests that Bitcoin may hit a new record of $88,000 in 2024, settling at around $77,000 by year-end. Finder, a UK fintech firm, conducted a study based on predictions from 40 crypto industry specialists. The experts anticipate an average peak price of $87,875 in 2024, with some predicting it could reach $200,000. Conversely, the lowest expected price by the end of 2024 is around $35,734, with a few forecasts of as low as $20,000. Over half of the surveyed experts expect prices to rise after a \"BTC halving event\" in April 2024, where the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is halved. This reward could decrease to 3.125, leading to a decrease in supply and potentially higher prices.\n\nSome experts believe Bitcoin faces pressure due to the halving event and increasing interest from major companies and institutional investors, which could drive up demand. The approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to bring more buyers into the market, as it makes trading Bitcoin-related investment funds easier on US stock exchanges. Additionally, analysts anticipate that a cut in the historically high benchmark rate by the US Federal Reserve could lead to more liquidity flowing into Bitcoin, further boosting its price. However, John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, remains cautious, viewing cryptocurrency as primarily speculative in nature. He stated:\n\n“If the new spot Bitcoin ETFs are popular, there could be a temporary price increase. But, in the medium to longer-term, I still regard Bitcoin as a speculative bubble.”\n\nOn the other hand, the global blockchain market was valued at about $7.4 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach over $94 billion by the end of 2027, with a projected compound annual growth rate of approximately 66.2% during the period from 2022 to 2027. Increased demand for blockchain technology across sectors such as retail, banking, and supply chain is anticipated to drive market expansion. However, the limited availability of skilled professionals to implement blockchain technology could pose a challenge to market growth.\n\nThis article discusses some of the best performing blockchain and bitcoin ETFs that provide investors with access to stocks like Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

Cost savings initiatives taken earlier in the year have resulted in three quarters of positive EBITDA leading to expectations for “meaningful positive adjusted EBITDA” for the full year 2023.

        "content": "AWS to offer NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU-based Amazon EC2 instances and NVIDIA DGX Cloud to accelerate performance of building and running inference on multi-trillion parameter LLMs\n\nIntegration of AWS Nitro System, Elastic Fabric Adapter encryption, and AWS Key Management Service with Blackwell encryption provides customers end-to-end control of their training data and model weights to provide even stronger security for customers’ AI applications on AWS\n\nProject Ceiba—an AI supercomputer built exclusively on AWS with DGX Cloud—to feature 20,736 GB200 Superchips capable of processing 414 exaflops for NVIDIA’s own AI R&D\n\nAmazon SageMaker integration with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices helps customers further optimize price performance of foundation models running on GPUs\n\nCollaboration between AWS and NVIDIA accelerates AI innovation across healthcare and life sciences\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GTC—Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced that the new NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform—unveiled by NVIDIA at GTC 2024—is coming to AWS. AWS will offer the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs, extending the companies’ longstanding strategic collaboration to deliver the most secure and advanced infrastructure, software, and services to help customers unlock new generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nNVIDIA and AWS continue to bring together the best of their technologies, including NVIDIA’s newest multi-node systems featuring the next-generation NVIDIA Blackwell platform and AI software, AWS’s Nitro System and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) advanced security, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) petabit scale networking, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) UltraCluster hyper-scale clustering. Together, they deliver the infrastructure and tools that enable customers to build and run real-time inference on multi-trillion parameter large language models (LLMs) faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The deep collaboration between our two organizations goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world’s first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of NVIDIA GPU solutions for customers,\" said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. \"NVIDIA’s next-generation Grace Blackwell processor marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing. When combined with AWS’s powerful Elastic Fabric Adapter Networking, Amazon EC2 UltraClusters’ hyper-scale clustering, and our unique Nitro system’s advanced virtualization and security capabilities, we make it possible for customers to build and run multi-trillion parameter large language models faster, at massive scale, and more securely than anywhere else. Together, we continue to innovate to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\"\n\n\"AI is driving breakthroughs at an unprecedented pace, leading to new applications, business models, and innovation across industries,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"Our collaboration with AWS is accelerating new generative AI capabilities and providing customers with unprecedented computing power to push the boundaries of what's possible.\"\n\nLatest innovations from AWS and NVIDIA accelerate training of cutting-edge LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters\n\nAWS will offer the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, featuring GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink™. When connected with Amazon’s powerful networking (EFA), and supported by advanced virtualization (AWS Nitro System) and hyper-scale clustering (Amazon EC2 UltraClusters), customers can scale to thousands of GB200 Superchips. NVIDIA Blackwell on AWS delivers a massive leap forward in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\n\nBased on the success of the NVIDIA H100-powered EC2 P5 instances, which are available to customers for short durations through Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, AWS plans to offer EC2 instances featuring the new B100 GPUs deployed in EC2 UltraClusters for accelerating generative AI training and inference at massive scale. GB200s will also be available on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, an AI platform co-engineered on AWS, that gives enterprise developers dedicated access to the infrastructure and software needed to build and deploy advanced generative AI models. The Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud instances on AWS will accelerate development of cutting-edge generative AI and LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters.\n\nElevate AI security with AWS Nitro System, AWS KMS, encrypted EFA, and Blackwell encryption\n\nAs customers move quickly to implement AI in their organizations, they need to know that their data is being handled securely throughout their training workflow. The security of model weights—the parameters that a model learns during training that are critical for its ability to make predictions—is paramount to protecting customers’ intellectual property, preventing tampering with models, and maintaining model integrity.\n\nAWS AI infrastructure and services already have security features in place to give customers control over their data and ensure that it is not shared with third-party model providers. The combination of the AWS Nitro System and the NVIDIA GB200 takes AI security even further by preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing model weights. The GB200 allows physical encryption of the NVLink connections between GPUs and encrypts data transfer from the Grace CPU to the Blackwell GPU, while EFA encrypts data across servers for distributed training and inference. The GB200 will also benefit from the AWS Nitro System, which offloads I/O for functions from the host CPU/GPU to specialized AWS hardware to deliver more consistent performance, while its enhanced security protects customer code and data during processing—on both the customer side and AWS side. This capability—available only on AWS—has been independently verified by NCC Group, a leading cybersecurity firm.\n\nWith the GB200 on Amazon EC2, AWS will enable customers to create a trusted execution environment alongside their EC2 instance, using AWS Nitro Enclaves and AWS KMS. Nitro Enclaves allows customers to encrypt their training data and weights with KMS, using key material under their control. The enclave can be loaded from within the GB200 instance and can communicate directly with the GB200 Superchip. This enables KMS to communicate directly with the enclave and pass key material directly to it in a cryptographically secure way. The enclave can then pass that material to the GB200, protected from the customer instance and preventing AWS operators from ever accessing the key or decrypting the training data or model weights, giving customers unparalleled control over their data.\n\nProject Ceiba taps Blackwell to propel NVIDIA’s future generative AI innovation on AWS\n\nAnnounced at AWS re:Invent 2023, Project Ceiba is a collaboration between NVIDIA and AWS to build one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers. Hosted exclusively on AWS, the supercomputer is available for NVIDIA’s own research and development. This first-of-its-kind supercomputer with 20,736 B200 GPUs is being built using the new NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, a system featuring fifth-generation NVLink connected to 10,368 NVIDIA Grace CPUs. The system scales out using fourth-generation EFA networking, providing up to 800 Gbps per Superchip of low-latency, high-bandwidth networking throughput—capable of processing a massive 414 exaflops of AI—a 6x performance increase over earlier plans to build Ceiba on the Hopper architecture. NVIDIA research and development teams will use Ceiba to advance AI for LLMs, graphics (image/video/3D generation) and simulation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, NVIDIA Earth-2 climate prediction, and more to help NVIDIA propel future generative AI innovation.\n\nAWS and NVIDIA collaboration accelerates development of generative AI applications and advance use cases in healthcare and life sciences\n\nAWS and NVIDIA have joined forces to offer high-performance, low-cost inference for generative AI with Amazon SageMaker integration with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Customers can use this combination to quickly deploy FMs that are pre-compiled and optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs to SageMaker, reducing the time-to-market for generative AI applications.\n\nAWS and NVIDIA have teamed up to expand computer-aided drug discovery with new NVIDIA BioNeMo™ FMs for generative chemistry, protein structure prediction, and understanding how drug molecules interact with targets. These new models will soon be available on AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service that helps healthcare and life sciences organizations store, query, and analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data.\n\nAWS HealthOmics and NVIDIA Healthcare teams are also working together to launch generative AI microservices to advance drug discovery, medtech, and digital health—delivering a new catalog of GPU-accelerated cloud endpoints for biology, chemistry, imaging and healthcare data so healthcare enterprises can take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI on AWS.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\n\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.

        "title": "Nvidia debuts next-generation Blackwell AI chip at GTC 2024",
        "content": "On Monday, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang took the wraps off of the company’s highly anticipated Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) at the company’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nThe Blackwell is the successor to Nvidia’s already highly coveted H100 and H200 GPUs, and according to the company, it is the world’s most powerful chip. The H100 and H200 chips have become the go-to GPUs for AI applications, helping to rocket Nvidia’s data center revenue over the last few quarters.\n\nIn its latest quarter alone, the company reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion. To put the segment’s growth into perspective, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $27 billion for all of 2022.\n\n“For three decades we’ve pursued accelerated computing with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,” Huang said in a statement.\n\n“Generative AI is the defining technology of our time. Blackwell GPUs are the engine to power this new industrial revolution. Working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry.”\n\nLike its prior Hopper GPUs, the Blackwell GPU will be available as a standalone GPU, or two Blackwell GPUs can be combined and paired with Nvidia’s Grace central processing unit to create what it calls its GB200 Superchip.\n\nThat setup, the company says, will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy. That energy savings is an important part of the story.\n\nNvidia customers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), are currently using or actively developing their own in-house AI chips as alternatives to Nvidia’s offerings. Part of the reason for that is so that they don’t have to pay the tens of thousands of dollars Nvidia’s chips are estimated to cost. But the other reason is that Nvidia’s chips are especially power-hungry.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy talking up its energy savings with the Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia is speaking directly to its customers’ concerns.\n\nNvidia says Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) will be among the first companies to start offering access to Blackwell chips through their cloud platforms.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell and Grace Blackwell chips, Nvidia also debuted its DGX SuperPOD supercomputer system. The DGX SuperPOD is made up of eight or more DGX Grace Blackwell 200 (GB200) systems, which include 36 Grace Blackwell 200 Superchips paired to run as a single computer. Nvidia says customers can scale up the SuperPOD to support tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips depending on their needs. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe DGX SuperPOD also gets a new liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, which means the system is cooled off using fluid circulating through a series of pipes and radiators rather than straight-up fan-based air cooling, which can be less efficient and more energy intensive.\n\nThe Blackwell GPU and GB200 Superchip will be Nvidia’s new top-of-the-line leaders when it comes to AI training and inferencing, which means they’ll be in high demand the moment they hit the market.\n\nBut competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) aren’t sitting idly by; they are almost certainly working on their own chips with the hopes of eventually catching Nvidia.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

In 2020, the number of people aged above 60 was 5 times greater than the number of children under the age of 5. By 2030, almost one in every six people will be aged 60 or over.

        "content": "Monday, March 18, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), American Express Company (AXP) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+78.5% vs. +53.4%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping Amazon in gaining further momentum among the customers. Robust Alexa skills and expanding smart home products portfolio are positives.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, adverse macroeconomic challenges remain concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+40.8% vs. +23.5%). The company’s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues.\r\n\r\nConsumer spending on T&E, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with ample cash. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\r\n\r\nHowever, with higher utilization of the firm’s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card maember rewards are likely to go up and strain its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. AmEx seems overvalued at the current price/earnings level. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Philip Morris have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past year (+3.1% vs. -0.2%). The company has demonstrated impressive resilience amid rising costs due to its smoke-free strength. The company has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is likely to remain a driver.\r\n\r\nThe consistent success of IQOS and the impressive growth of ZYN have further solidified the company’s position, keeping it well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030. For 2024, management expects net revenues to increase 6.5-8% on an organic basis.\r\n\r\nHowever, growth-oriented investments, especially in IQOS ILUMA, may impact profits. Also, management expects the increased cost of leaf and wages to linger into 2024 before easing thereafter. Apart from this, Philip Morris has been witnessing soft cigarette volumes, which declined 1.4% in 2023.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NIKE, Inc. (NKE), Bayer Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "At US$174, Is It Time To Put Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) On Your Watch List?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amazon.com’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Amazon.com?\n\nGreat news for investors – Amazon.com is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $238.66, but it is currently trading at US$174 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Amazon.com’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from Amazon.com? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since AMZN is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy AMZN. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\n\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Amazon.com mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Amazon.com, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all firmly placed the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and blasted to record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength in various sectors and industries, much of the heavy lifting for the current bull market can be attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAs their collective name implies, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. They're often industry leaders (sometimes in more than one category) and traditionally on the cutting edge of technological innovation(s). In order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAll seven of these companies have overwhelmingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over extended periods. This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers.\n\nHowever, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.\n\nSurprise! Billionaire money managers are selling AI stock Nvidia\n\nInvestors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders.\n\nIn a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.\n\nHowever, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nMost investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts.\n\nAnother kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too.\n\nThere's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA multi-industry leader has been a popular buy for billionaire investors\n\nTo be perfectly fair, Nvidia wasn't the only AI stock and member of the Magnificent Seven that billionaire investors put on the chopping block during the fourth quarter. Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter.\n\nBut there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble.\n\nYet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message.\n\nWith regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.\n\nAlthough Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow. Billionaire investors recognize a long-term value when they see one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 best esports stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the esports and video gaming industry, go directly to the 5 Best Esports Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nEsports is growing at a fast pace and is one of the industries that has made millionaires out of young people. For example, Illya Mulyarchuk, nicknamed Yatoro, is a 20-year-old DOTA 2 (multiplayer online battle arena video game) player who managed to grab nearly $3.7 million at the age of 18 from a single event in 2021. The massive prize pools are a testament to the rapid development of this young industry.\n\nIn 2023, Singapore became the first country to host Olympic Esports Week. In an interview with CNBC in June 2023, Singapore’s minister of state for culture, community, and youth, Alvin Tan, said that they are optimistic about the growth opportunities in the industry. The minister added that the event is a “pathfinder” in terms of revenue generation and revealed that the esports audience has reached over half a billion people. He further commented that South East Asia is the fastest-growing esports region. According to a market analysis report by Research and Markets, the global esports market was valued at around $2.56 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21.9% between 2023 and 2030 and reach $12.5 billion by the end of the forecasted period.\n\nThe expansion of the industry is sustained by a significant increase in broadcasting rights, technological innovations, and an increase in the global gaming audience. Nevertheless, the industry is still new and is in its adjustment period. Since 2022, there has been a decline in investments and sponsorship deals in the industry. On January 23, Reuters citedNewzoo’s report and said that the global gaming market declined by 4.3% in 2022. Nevertheless, it grew 0.6% in 2023 and is expected to grow by 2.8% to $189.3 billion in 2024.\n\nThe industry experienced the most significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO) gained over 100% between February 2020 and 2021. While the esports industry has been facing some challenges since 2022, the companies are still performing well as the ETF has gained over 33.89% in the last twelve months, as of March 8, compared to the S&P 500’s 8% gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nProminent Names in the Industry\n\nAs mentioned, the esports industry is quite young. However, it has managed to grab the attention of some big names in the US market. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are some companies that are deeply involved in the industry as their subsidiaries, Twitch and YouTube (respectively), hold the broadcasting rights for some of the biggest esports events in the world. In addition, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has served as a sponsor and hardware supplier for esports events, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made significant contributions with its cutting-edge graphics processing technology.\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another big name in the industry. Its US-based subsidiary, Riot Games, produced League of Legends (LoL), which was the most-viewed esports game in the world in 2023, according to Esports Insider. According to John Needham, Riot’s president of esports, their major LoL events, such as the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) and Worlds, saw significant growth in Average Minute Audience (AMA) in 2023. MSI saw an AMA increase of 58% year-over-year (YoY), while Worlds’ AMA was up by 65%. The parent company, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), is also working on expanding its video gaming business further.

Here is what the Executive Vice President and CFO of the company, Amy Hood, said about the acquisition in its latest earnings call:\n\n“At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement.”\n\nHood further added:\n\n“Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned.\n\nOperating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.”\n\nOn March 1, TheFly reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is partnering with GPU hardware vendors, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

        "title": "The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index is in record territory. While that's exciting news for some, it may be discouraging for those who have been on the sidelines.\n\nBut don't let the market's rise keep you from seeking out compelling investment opportunities. There are still some quality companies selling at attractive valuations.\n\nIf you've got $1,000 you're ready to invest, then don't look past Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why it's the ultimate growth stock to buy right now.\n\nSizable growth potential\n\nAmazon generated $575 billion in net sales in 2023. That's more than the GDP of some countries, like Ireland and Thailand. And it puts Amazon behind only Walmart on the Fortune 500 list.\n\nTo be clear, this revenue figure makes Amazon a colossal organization. But investors would be delighted to know that the business still has meaningful opportunities to expand, thanks to multiple growth tailwinds.\n\nAmazon's business was built on the expectation of the expansion of online shopping. Today, nearly 40% of all e-commerce spending in the U.S. happens on its website. There's still a massive runway for online activity to take share from brick-and-mortar shopping, which should lift the business in the years ahead.\n\nThe popularity of Amazon Prime membership not only feeds into greater e-commerce sales, but it can also lead to Prime Video attracting more TV viewing time. Consequently, Amazon also benefits from the streaming trend.\n\nThen there's digital advertising, a segment that raked in $14.7 billion in revenue just in the last three months. That total was up 26% year over year. In the U.S., Amazon is behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms in the industry, something most investors might not realize.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting part of the equation is the cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). While growth here has slowed due to macro headwinds, the industry-leading segment boasts a Q4 operating margin of 30%. And AWS gives Amazon a major avenue to introduce artificial intelligence innovations to its client base.\n\nStory continues\n\nPay the price\n\nIt's not difficult to convince someone that Amazon is a great business. The facts speak for themselves. It's no wonder shares have soared 8,300% in the last 20 years.\n\nBut even at a market cap of almost $1.9 trillion today, it still makes for a worthy investment candidate. That's because Amazon shares trade at a price-to-sales multiple of just under 3.3 right now. Even after the stock soared 113% since the start of 2023, its valuation is about in line with its trailing 10-year average.\n\nPaying that price for Amazon looks like the right move. This business possesses numerous competitive advantages that give me confidence in its ability to thrive far into the future. It has a scale and logistics footprint that rivals can't match, particularly when it comes to better serving its customer base.\n\nAnd even more importantly, Amazon continues to develop its data advantage. There are very few companies that can collect the massive amounts of data from its customers like Amazon can. And management can constantly find ways to glean insights that better drive marketing and product development efforts.\n\nInvestors have reason to be even more optimistic, though. After years of aggressive capital expenditures, executives are now focused on creating a more efficient organization, cutting costs across the board.\n\nThis means that Amazon, which saw its operating income surge 202% in 2023, could see accelerating bottom-line gains. And this can propel the stock even further.\n\nNow looks like a good time for prospective investors to add Amazon to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\nFleeing one’s home, with or without family members, and leaving behind prized possessions and a life, is a traumatic experience that millions of people go through every year. Amidst the plethora of bleak realities of life, the existence of millions of refugees stands as another sad fact. The forceful displacement of people has existed in the past, persists to this day, and will likely continue until the end of times. Both the US law and the United Nations' 1951 Refugee Convention (an international agreement signed by 149 countries to protect refugees) define refugees as individuals seeking entry into another country who can prove they have been persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\n\nRefugees: A Global Overview\n\nAccording to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), by mid-2023, 110 million people had been forcibly displaced due to 'persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or events seriously disturbing public order.' Among these, 36.4 million are refugees. Remarkably, 52% of all refugees and individuals in need of international protection hail from just three countries: the Syrian Arab Republic (6.5 million), Afghanistan (6.1 million), and Ukraine (5.9 million). It's noteworthy that 3.4 million of these refugees are hosted by two Muslim-majority countries, namely The Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey. Following closely are Germany, hosting 2.5 million refugees, Colombia with just under 2.5 million refugees (including others in need of international protection), and Pakistan with 2.1 million refugees. Also check out our article 20 Most Refugee-Hosting Countries in the World for a detailed outlook.\n\nAnother troubling statistic is the number of children born as refugees, which reached 1.9 million (with 385,000 children born as refugees annually from 2019 to 2022). Furthermore, it was observed that the majority (69%) of refugees and individuals in need of protection relocated to neighboring countries, with low and middle-income countries accommodating 75% of these individuals. On a positive note, 463,500 refugees returned to their home countries in the first half of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nRefugees in the US\n\nAs the world's leading country resettling refugees, the United States has been welcoming them for decades. The country has provided assistance to approximately 650,000 displaced individuals from Europe after World War II, as well as people fleeing communist regimes in Europe and Asia during the Cold War, among others. Some US states, such as Texas, California, and New York, have accepted the largest numbers of refugees.\n\nIn 1980, the government established a permanent standardized system for identifying, vetting, and resettling refugees, known as the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). However, the number of refugees admitted to the country has seen a decline from 200,000 in 1980 to 60,014 in 2023. The figures have fluctuated sharply over the years, depending on the prevailing strategies of the time. For instance, the 9/11 attacks led to a suspension of refugee admissions for several months. The ceilings for admission have also changed according to the administration and the global conditions. While President Obama's administration increased the ceiling to 110,000 in 2017 following the crises in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Trump administration reduced it to 50,000 in 2017 and further down to 18,000 for 2020. However, the Biden administration has reversed these previous ceilings and set the cap at 125,000 for fiscal years 2023 and 2024.\n\nBig US Companies Stepping-Up\n\nAt the 2022 Tent Business Summit, 45 major companies and brands, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) pledged to hire and train 22,725 refugees for full-time positions in the US.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced plans to hire 5,000 refugees over three years, while Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) committed to hiring 2,500, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) to 1,500, and both PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) to 500 each. These collective efforts are expected to generate $913 million in income for refugees. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) VP of Employee Relations, WW Amazon Stores and Corporate, emphasized the importance of diversity within the company and expressed their commitment to hiring individuals in need. 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\n20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the US, we examined data from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics and the U.S. Department of State's report on 'Refugee Arrivals by Region and Country of Nationality: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2022.' We focused on figures from the year 2022 and organized our list in an ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet us now take a look at our list for 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\n20. Central African Republic\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 181\n\nA landlocked country in the heart of Africa, the Central African Republic has been besieged by armed conflict and instability for years. Additionally, it is considered one of the poorest states in the world. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of 2023, more than 1.4 million people in the Central African Republic have been displaced from their homes, which accounts for about one-third of the country’s population. Since 2013, armed conflict between various groups has forced many residents (more than 640,000) to flee the country, while approximately 630,000 have been displaced internally. Some have sought refuge in neighboring countries, while others have migrated to the US.\n\n19. Armenia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 198\n\nFor a long time, Armenians have been immigrating to the US and settling, primarily in California. Historical events such as the Hamidian massacre of the mid-1890s, the Adana Massacre of 1909, and the Armenian genocide of 1915-1918 have contributed to this migration. More recently, factors such as war defeats and poor economic conditions in the country have compelled many to leave their homes. Many have found their way to the US, making them one of the countries with most refugees in the US.\n\n18. Burundi\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 219\n\nAn East Central African country with a population of 12.2 million, thousands have fled their country to avoid persecution due to their political beliefs. The refugee crisis began in 2015 following political unrest between civilians and the government. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), approximately 333,700 refugees have sought a safe haven in various countries, including the US. In 2015, 1,218 Burundi refugees arrived in the US. However, this figure steadily decreased until 2020, after which it began to increase once more.\n\n17. Colombia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 254\n\nFor over 40 years, millions of Colombians have been forced to flee their country due to ongoing conflict. The war between the Colombian government, guerrilla groups like FARC and ELN, paramilitaries, and narco-traffickers has resulted in the loss of 50,000 to 200,000 lives. Additionally, it has internally displaced 3.5 million people and caused 500,000 to 750,000 Colombian refugees in neighboring countries. Some have sought refuge in the US, with their numbers fluctuating over the years.\n\n16. Iran\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 258\n\nThe 1979 revolution sparked the largest wave of Iranians leaving the country. The Iran-Iraq war and subsequent failed political reforms further worsened the situation. In the past decade, people have been compelled to seek refuge in other countries due to political oppression, social unrest, and religious persecution, leading to reports of many unaccompanied children fleeing to Europe. Refugees are also seeking asylum in the US, making it one of the countries with the highest number of Iranian refugees. While refugee arrivals were much higher in the years 2013-2017, they have since decreased.\n\n15. Ethiopia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 266\n\nEthiopia is another country that has contributed a significant number of refugees to the US. The 1980 Refugee Act marked the beginning of Ethiopians moving to the US, largely driven by the repressive regime of Mariam. Additionally, many Ethiopians who had previously migrated to Sudan also sought relocation to the US. The number of refugees arriving in the country has fluctuated over the years, with a slower rate of arrivals depicted in recent years.\n\n14. South Sudan\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 290\n\nThe largest refugee crisis in Africa and the third-largest in the world, approximately 2.4 million South Sudanese have fled to neighboring countries, while 2.3 million are internally displaced, as of July 2023, according to the UNHCR. This crisis has primarily been triggered by civil wars in the country, along with economic decline, disease, and hunger. Sudanese refugees have been accepted into the US since 2001 and continue to arrive to this day, becoming one of the country with the most refugees in the US.\n\n13. Eritrea\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 317\n\nEritrea has long been recognized as one of the most repressive countries globally, characterized by the denial of basic rights such as freedom of speech and religion, as well as compulsory mass conscription for individuals aged 18-50. Consequently, according to UNHCR, as of June 2023, there are approximately 580,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers worldwide. The UN Refugee Agency has played a significant role in resettling many Eritrean refugees in the US. Although arrivals have tapered off in recent years, the country has experienced significant influxes at times. For instance, around 1,900 refugees arrived in the US in both 2016 and 2017.\n\n12. Honduras\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 447\n\nAccording to the US Customs and Border Protection, Honduras is among the countries contributing the highest number of refugees to the southern US border. Several factors contribute to this movement, including natural disasters such as droughts and floods, as well as issues like corruption, poverty, and lawlessness in the country. In 2022, there was a significant increase in the number of Honduran refugees arriving in the US-- 447 compared to 83 in 2021.\n\n11. Somalia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 491\n\nThe Somali refugee crisis stands as one of the largest mass displacements witnessed globally. For over thirty years, individuals from Somalia have fled to neighboring areas, primarily due to political instability, the civil war in the 1990s, and conflicts such as the one in the city of Laascaanood. According to UNHCR, approximately 714,390 Somali refugees and asylum seekers are living in nearby countries. A large number of these refugees have also sought refuge in the US. While the number of arrivals has declined in recent years, Somalia remains one of the countries with the highest number of refugees in the US.\n\n10. Iraq\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 501\n\nThe 2003 US invasion resulted in approximately 1 in 25 Iraqis being displaced, a situation exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of the Islamic State. According to UNHCR, as of April 2023, about 1.2 million Iraqis have been displaced. Many Iraqis have sought refuge in the US as refugees, with numbers as high as slightly over 19,000 in both 2013 and 2014. However, the numbers have steadily decreased over the years.\n\n9. Moldova\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 511\n\nThe civil war of 1992 resulted in the displacement of many Moldovans internally and as refugees across various countries. While some returned after the conflict ended, their integration into society was largely ignored by the government. Moldovan refugees have been arriving in the US for quite some time, with their numbers fluctuating. There was a substantial increase from 75 in 2021 to 511 in 2022.\n\n8. El Salvador\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 524\n\nEl Salvador has endured prolonged organized crime, violence, poverty, and numerous socioeconomic challenges, compounded by natural disasters and the recent Ukraine situation. As a result, many people have been forced to flee the country in search of a better future for their next generation, often ending up at the southern border of the US. A significant surge in refugee arrivals was recorded by the US government in 2017, after which the number has steadily declined.\n\n7. Guatemala\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 1,084\n\nThe deteriorating situation in the country across various aspects is driving refugee arrivals in the US. The presence of violence and worsening socioeconomic conditions, exacerbated by poverty and climate shocks, has made life in the country very challenging for some people, compelling them to seek refuge at the US southern border. Since 2016, their annual arrivals have been on the rise, reaching an all-time high of 1,084 registered in 2022.\n\n6. Ukraine\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 1,586\n\nThe February 2024 war in Ukraine has led to devastating consequences, displacing 3.7 million people internally and creating 6.5 million refugees spread across neighboring countries. Ukrainian refugees have also been arriving in the US. While the number steadily rose to an all-time high in 2020, registering 4,432 refugees, it began to decline before escalating once more in 2022.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Best Places to Live in Florida 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US 20 Countries with Highest Net Migration\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S. is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 20 Best Countries to Move to from USA. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Countries to Move to from USA.\n\nOnce known as the land of immigrants, the United States may now be experiencing a shift toward becoming a land of emigrants. While the American government does not formally measure the number of people leaving the country, the State Department estimates the figure to be around 9 million. However, according to the Association of Americans Resident Overseas (AARO), when excluding Americans who are outside of the country for reasons other than living abroad (such as tourism), the figure stands at around 5.4 million in 2023.\n\nWhat is Pushing Americans to Move Abroad?\n\nA Gallup survey conducted in 2018 revealed that approximately 16% of Americans expressed a desire to leave the country permanently. Notably, 40% of women under the age of 30 expressed this desire, along with 22% of those who disapproved of the Trump administration and 7% of those who approved of it. Canada emerged as the desired destination for most respondents.\n\nA more recent survey by Preply in 2023, targeting around 3,000 Gen Z US residents aged between 18 and 26, found that 25.6% cited social programs (such as universal healthcare) as the primary reason for considering leaving the country. Other motivating factors included the desire for new cultural experiences (18.9%), the high cost of living (18%), and dissatisfaction with the US political environment (17.7%). Additionally, 59% of respondents mentioned that the prevalence of gun violence in the country influenced their decision to emigrate. Interestingly, variations were observed across different states regarding this trend. For instance, residents of Memphis and Tennessee expressed a higher inclination toward leaving, whereas those in Nashville did not voice such opinions.\n\nWhile the cost of living has become a significant factor driving emigration among American residents, iconic US companies such as Medtronic Plc. (NYSE: MDT) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) have had to make major financial decisions due to the US government's tax regime and inversion rules. In 2016, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) abandoned its $160 billion acquisition deal of Allergan due to sudden US Treasury rules aimed at discouraging inversion. Similarly, Medtronic Plc. (NYSE: MDT) acquired Covidien for $42.9 billion in 2014 and relocated its headquarters to Ireland in order to benefit from tax savings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Expat Community\n\nAmerican expatriates are dispersed across more than 160 countries, with preferences varying. Approximately 40% opt for the Western hemisphere (Canada, Central and South America), while 26% move to Europe, 14% to East Asia and the Pacific (including Japan, China, New Zealand, and Australia), and another 14% settle in the Middle East.\n\nMost American expatriates gravitate towards developed nations, where they can enjoy comfortable living standards, various amenities, reasonable costs of living, tax advantages, and lucrative job prospects. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM) play a significant role in facilitating the transition for US residents moving abroad by providing job opportunities and assistance with relocation.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) maintains a global, mobile workforce presence and is renowned as one of the largest employment-sponsored visa firms. Their Global Mobility Plan is designed to assist workers navigating the immigration process. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently introduced 14 new benefits, including free estate planning and mental health care, further demonstrating the company's commitment to easing the lives of its employees.\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM), with operations in various countries such as Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom, presents another highly attractive job opportunity for American expatriates. In 2023, Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM) was recognized among the companies offering the best employee benefits and perks. 20 Best Countries to Move to from USA\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 Best Countries to Move to from the USA, we analyzed articles such as 15 Best Countries to Move to from US that Speak English, 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens, and 20 Best Countries to Relocate to.

Moreover, with its low cost of living, Cyprus stands out as a highly feasible option for US residents looking to move away from the high living costs in their home country. An individual can live comfortably in Cyprus by spending just $935 per month, excluding rent. Therefore, Cyprus emerges as one of the best countries to move to from the US.\n\n9.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Walmart vs. Costco",
        "content": "Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) have certain attributes in common. Both retailers have achieved great success through giving shoppers low prices. And they've rewarded shareholders handsomely over the years.\n\nThey have simple businesses with management that execute very well. Both appear well positioned for the future.\n\nBut which one offers investors the better opportunity? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWalmart\n\nSince opening its first discount store more than six decades ago, Walmart has remained focused on keeping costs down and passing these savings on to customers in the form of low prices. It has adapted over the years by offering omnichannel capabilities and a subscription service to keep pace with online retailers such as behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWalmart has a reputation as the low-cost retailer. Since everyone loves low prices, this draws customers in all kinds of economic environments. In fact, people find it especially compelling during sluggish economic times as people crave saving money.\n\nIt continues to grow revenue and profits. In its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 31, adjusted revenue grew 4.9% to $172.1 billion. This removes foreign currency translation effects. Adjusted operating income increased 10.9%.\n\nManagement continues to push Walmart forward. This includes its advertising business, which grew 28% to $3.4 billion last year. It seeks to give the business a boost with the recently announced $2.3 billion acquisition of Vizio. The maker of smart televisions makes money from advertising in a variety of ways.\n\nWalmart's share price has gained over 34% in the past year. Despite the gain, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains at 31.\n\nWhile the stock had an impressive increase, it's kept pace with the S&P 500's gain. The market sells at a 23 P/E multiple. While Walmart's stock has a higher valuation, the company has consistently grown profitability and recently expanded its advertising business.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco\n\nCostco also offers value to customers, but it has a different way of doing business. It charges members an annual fee to shop at its warehouses. These huge spaces offer many goods and services -- practically everything under the sun. Costco generally sells high-quality goods, often in bulk, at attractive unit prices.\n\nIt continues to attract new members and retain old ones. Membership grew from 72 million to 73.4 million over the last three months. And retention consistently hovers around 90%.\n\nCostco continues to grow revenue and profitability. Its fiscal second-quarter revenue rose by 5.7% to $58.4 billion, and operating income increased by 8.4% to $2.1 billion. While management has put off an increase in membership fees, when it does decide to implement one, that will likely further improve revenue and profits. Members don't seem likely to balk, given the high retention, and it's been seven years since the last fee hike.\n\nMembers continue to find Costco's membership proposition worthwhile. That's helped it produce consistently higher profitability, even during challenging economic times. That means the shares, which have risen 56% over the past year, aren't cheap.\n\nCostco's stock has a P/E of 50, up from 36 a year ago. No one would argue that's a cheap valuation. But the company continues to grow sales and profits. And it has more potential growth as it steadily opens new warehouses annually.\n\nDecision\n\nWalmart and Costco have strong businesses. That makes this a tough decision.\n\nDespite the stock's richer valuation, I favor Costco's stock over Walmart's shares. It continues to have growth opportunities, and it opened four warehouses in the last quarter. Management has held off on price increases, which I find commendable given the impact inflation has been having on people. But it will raise membership fees at the appropriate time, and that will further boost profitability growth.\n\nPaying a higher valuation seems worthwhile given Costco's strong attributes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "It hasn't been easy to be a stock investor in recent years, with more market volatility than usual.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw many stocks skyrocket in 2021 as homebound consumers invested in home offices and entertainment products. However, an economic downturn in 2022 brought the market crashing back down and led many companies' shares to lose what they had gained the year before.\n\nThen, in 2023, the market once again swung in the opposite direction, with the Nasdaq Composite climbing 43%. Excitement over tech and artificial intelligence (AI) prompted an impressive recovery. And the same index is up about 8% in 2024, seemingly breaking the yo-yo-like pattern that has occurred in recent years.\n\nHowever, recent volatility highlights the importance of investing in stocks with a long-term mindset. Those who sold in 2022 will not have profited from the swift rise many stocks enjoyed in 2023 and continue to see this year.\n\nAs a result, now is an excellent time to fortify your portfolio by investing in companies likely to deliver consistent gains long into the future. So, here are two hypergrowth stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTech stocks have surged over the last year thanks to a boom in AI. According to Grand View Research, the industry hit close to $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. This trajectory would see the AI market reach a valuation nearing $2 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has cornered the market on AI chips. Last year, the tech giant achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models. Nvidia's success in the industry has seen its stock increase 294% over the last year alongside soaring earnings.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen 207%, while operating income has skyrocketed 536%. Additionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% to more than $27 billion. For reference, rival chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel posted free cash flow of $1 billion and negative $14 billion last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both chipmakers, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Nvidia's stock is potentially trading at its best value in months, with its price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios declining by double digits since last July. These are helpful metrics in determining a stock's value, with the lower figure representing the better the value.\n\nAlongside a lucrative role in AI, Nvidia is a hypergrowth stock worth considering in 2024 and beyond.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a tech behemoth with a market cap of $1.8 billion, making it the world's fifth most valuable company. Since its founding almost 30 years ago, the retail giant has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nThe company was one of the hardest hit in 2022, as spikes in inflation curbed consumer spending and caused its stock to plunge 50% during the challenging year. However, Amazon pulled off an impressive turnaround last year, which has proven the value of its stock as a long-term hold.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion. Various cost-cutting moves brought profitability back to its retail segments. Meanwhile, the company's dominating position in the cloud market with Amazon Web Services granted it a promising role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by Amazon's forward P/E of 42, you get a stock price of $294.\n\nFrom its current position, this would see Amazon's stock rise 66% over the next two fiscal years. Alongside dominating positions in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon's stock is worth buying right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Wall Street Most Bullish About: AMD, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You only needed to know one thing over the last year to make a lot of money investing: Buy large-cap artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nearly all of them have delivered sizzling returns.\n\nChipmakers Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have been especially big winners. Cloud services providers Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have also taken off.\n\nBut those performances are now history. Which AI stock is Wall Street most bullish about going forward: AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, or Nvidia?\n\nAnalysts give a thumbs down to these AI stocks\n\nWe can quickly eliminate two of these big AI stocks. Wall Street doesn't have great expectations for AMD or Nvidia over the near term.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target for AMD reflects a small decline from the current price. That's not too surprising, considering the stock has skyrocketed more than 130% over the last 12 months. Many analysts seem to think that AMD is due for a breather.\n\nIt's a similar story with Nvidia. The stock has nearly tripled over the last year, thanks to surging demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs). But while that demand doesn't appear to be waning, the consensus on Wall Street is that Nvidia's shares don't have much more room to run. The average price target is a little lower than the current share price.\n\nNot every analyst gives a thumbs down to these two AI chipmakers, though. The most optimistic analysts think that AMD and Nvidia can still soar nearly 40% and 60%, respectively, over the next 12 months.\n\nThe contenders\n\nWall Street is more optimistic about Microsoft. The average price target for the tech giant reflects an upside potential of more than 10%. One analyst predicts that Microsoft's shares could jump more than 30% over the next 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft stands to profit from the AI boom in two key ways. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its software applications. This added functionality will likely attract more customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also the second-biggest cloud services provider with its Azure platform. Organizations are flocking to the cloud to build and deploy AI apps, especially ones focused on generative AI.\n\nHowever, analysts think Alphabet could outperform Microsoft, AMD, and Nvidia over the near term. The average 12-month price target for the stock is roughly 15% above the current price. The most bullish analyst expects Alphabet stock to vault nearly 30% higher.\n\nWhat about the recent embarrassment for Alphabet with Google Gemini creating inaccurate images of historical figures? Wall Street doesn't believe it will be more than a temporary speed bump. Like Microsoft, Google has integrated generative AI throughout many of its products. Google Cloud should also continue to benefit from the adoption of AI.\n\nWall Street's favorite\n\nThat leaves one big AI stock Wall Street likes the most. Amazon's average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of nearly 17%. The company's biggest fan in the analyst community thinks the stock could move close to 30% higher.\n\nAI stands out as one key growth driver for the company. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the leading market share in cloud services and enjoys the same AI tailwind as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\n\nAnalysts also recognize how much Amazon's focus on improving profitability and free cash flow is paying off. The e-commerce and cloud services giant's Q4 earnings jumped to $10.6 billion from $0.3 billion in the prior-year period. Free cash flow improved to $36.8 billion for the trailing 12 months, compared to negative free cash flow of $11.6 billion in the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nIs Wall Street right that Amazon will be the biggest winner of these five AI stocks over the next 12 months? Maybe. I agree that Amazon's momentum should continue.\n\nOver the long run, though, I expect that AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia will keep up their winning ways. We could look back 20 years from now and still be able to say that the one thing investors needed to know to make a lot of money was to buy large-cap AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently hit another record high on the continued strength of artificial intelligence and with some significant help from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's relentless climb. Nvidia now makes up 5% of the index, and its market cap blasted through the $2 trillion mark, making it worth more than Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) for the first time, as shown below. AMZN Market Cap Chart\n\nNvidia could continue the charge higher. It's a tremendous company (albeit an expensive stock). But investors shouldn't overlook Amazon. Here are my four top reasons why Amazon stock is worth buying like there is no tomorrow.\n\n1. AWS is seeing a resurgence\n\nThere was much handwringing last year as Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth slowed to 13%, after growing 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021. Revenue eclipsed $90 billion for the year, but some speculated that the golden age of cloud computing growth was over. This is premature, and I expect growth to accelerate this year.\n\nDeclining data usage budgets were a massive obstacle in 2023. Businesses hunkered down for a recession that never came, and Amazon actively assisted its customers in lowering their data usage costs. Budgets are likely to loosen this year as fears of a recession ease. While this headwind fades, a new tailwind emerges. Much of AWS' sales are usage-based (much like a utility), so the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) software should spur growth because of the massive data needs.\n\nInvestors and analysts will watch AWS closely this year. A resurgence in growth could be a catalyst for the stock.\n\n2. Amazon's free cash flow is back\n\nEconomic stimulus during the pandemic's height pushed Amazon's free cash flow (the amount of money left after paying for expenses and fixed assets) to record highs, but multiple challenges saw it plunge in 2022. There were snarls at the ports, a shortage of workers, and record inflation, all of which caused increases in costs.\n\nAWS was also a victim of its own success. The massive growth meant massive investments in equipment (CapEx) were needed. Amazon spent a combined $125 billion on CapEx in 2021 and 2022, compared to $57 billion in 2020 and 2021. That is a ton of cash, even for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese challenges ironed themselves out in 2023, and free cash flow roared back, as you can see below. AMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAmazon will surely use the cash to invest in growth, but it could also institute a share buyback program if it chooses.\n\n3. Amazon's advertising segment impresses\n\nOne of Amazon's fastest-growing revenue streams is online revenue, which includes product placement, pay-per-click, and video. Advertisers are eager to purchase these spots because they know that the ads are reaching customers who are actively looking to buy. If you are like me, you rarely scroll past the first page, and sellers know it. Advertising sales have exploded, going from $13 billion in 2019 to $46 billion in 2023.\n\nThis marked the first time ad sales beat out Prime subscription sales ($47 billion versus $40 billion). The segment should also benefit from loosening budgets in 2024. This is another terrific, growing revenue stream for Amazon.\n\n4. Consumer sentiment is on the upswing\n\nYou can count me among those who thought rising interest rates and slowing economic stimulus would crimp consumer spending. But there are few signs that consumers are pulling back. In fact, consumer sentiment, widely considered the leading indicator of consumer spending, is rising steadily, as shown below. US Index of Consumer Sentiment Chart\n\nThe number is still below pre-pandemic levels but has climbed impressively while inflation declines. This is excellent news because consumer spending is critical to Amazon's e-commerce business. Speaking of inflation, it has dropped to 3.2%. This shows that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes are taming inflation, and the economy is still growing. We aren't quite out of the woods yet, but so far, so good.\n\nAmazon stock has risen significantly over the last year, but it trades at a discount to its 5-year averages based on sales and operating cash flow. The tailwinds above make it an excellent long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the population change and growth trends in the States, you can go directly to 10 Cities With The Largest Population In The US.\n\nThe United States of America is a nation characterized by its vastness in terms of land, diversity, and population. With a total land area of over 3 million square miles, 50 states, and 19,495 incorporated cities, towns, and villages, the US is the fifth largest nation in terms of area worldwide. If we look at the population, according to Census Data, the country is home to a diverse population of 331,449,281 people.\n\nWhile the largest city in the US by area is Juneau, Alaska, the city only houses a population of 31,685. On the other hand, the largest city by population houses over eight million people, and is significantly smaller than Juneau in terms of land area. In other words, similar to the rest of the world, the population distribution in the US is not even.\n\nThe Census Bureau projects that in the next 57 years, by 2080, the nation’s population is expected to increase by another 35 million and reach the figure of 370 million. However, by 2100, the United States will see a rapid population decline, losing 10 million people within twenty years. Note that mortality rates are not the only factor that affects the population of a place — in the case of the States, the population trends will be greatly influenced in the coming years by the nation’s decreased fertility rates, aging population, and growing international migration trends.\n\nAlthough already uneven, the population distribution within the US is expected to change even more in the coming years. Forecasts suggest that the suburban and rural areas will see a rise in population, while the urban centers will see a notable decline. Mostly, this is because of the US’s aging population, and economic factors like inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven this factor, while the overall US population is expected to decline by the end of this century, there will be significant population distribution shifts as well. Some US cities will experience significant population growth, while others will see a sharp decline. As of 2024, the US cities with the largest population decline include Paradise, Nevada, and Jackson, Mississippi. (See also: 15 Biggest US Cities Facing Depopulation by 2100) On the other hand, according to the most recent Census data, the cities with the largest population growth include Dallas and other Texas cities.\n\nSome global key players also happen to have a significant presence in the largest cities in the US. For example, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, with the population distribution changes and overall population decline in the country, all companies may experience an eventual decline in the workforce. However, leading companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple have already started investing in innovation and technology, especially AI, so they may not be as significantly impacted by the future decline in population as one would think.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has made some notable investments in innovation and technology projects, such as Artificial Intelligence, to yield more efficiency and productivity. Last year in 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) invested $13 billion in OpenAI, integrating AI technology into its Bing search engine, GitHub coding tools, Azure Cloud, sales and marketing software, and more.\n\nSimilarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a world leader in the smartphone industry, is also investing hugely in generative AI technology, Tim Cook, the CEO, said in the annual shareholder meeting. He further stated in the virtual meeting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will break new grounds with generative AI and assist in productivity, problem-solving, and more.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has established a $1 billion venture investment program, supporting emerging technology companies with direct investments. As the company prioritizes productivity, it has made close to a dozen investments in companies with promising automating products, such as Rightbot.\n\nOverall, today, the presence of giant companies in the major cities in the US contributes to the economic growth and development of the cities and the country at large. Below, we discuss the cities with the largest population in the US as of 2024. 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\n50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the largest U.S. cities by population, we have sourced data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, and World Population Review (for Nashville city estimates only).

        "title": "These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "When investors think of stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, some might think the index has more than its share of stodgy industrial companies unlikely to produce more than nominal returns and ignore its component parts. But in recent years, Dow parent S&P Global has replaced old-economy companies such as Alcoa and General Electric in the index with more dynamic stocks that better represent the new economy.\n\nThis still-relevant index still has some stocks that hold the potential for significant gains. Two Dow components that remain relevant are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Nike (NYSE: NKE). Let's find out a bit more about these two stocks and why they are set to soar in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nMost people know Amazon best for its e-commerce site and its various Prime subscription services. But its potential as a growth stock primarily lies in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment. As a cloud provider, AWS plays a crucial role in supporting third-party applications and services of all sorts, including those driven by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAWS has long been the largest cloud provider, and it wants to leverage that leadership into a \"full stack\" approach to AI. This means building customized chips, writing software layers, training its models, and providing simple front ends that allow convenient connections to various AI services. Image source: Synergy Research Group.\n\nIn 2023, just 16% of the company's revenue came from AWS. At the same time, though, it supplied two-thirds of Amazon's operating income that year.\n\nThe company's other segments include fast-growing businesses such as advertising, subscriptions, and third-party seller services. The largest segment is online sales. It's also the segment with the slowest growth at the moment and the narrowest margins.\n\nStill, because of Amazon's segment diversity, it can grow fast even though it already has a mammoth $1.8 trillion market cap. Analysts forecast 44% net income growth this year and 26% in 2025. Also, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42 for the company, investors can benefit from Amazon's AI-driven growth without paying a massive premium.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Nike\n\nNike accomplished something seemingly impossible in the consumer space: It built competitive advantages in the sports apparel and equipment businesses. Aside from owning one of the world's most recognized brands, its well-managed global supply chain allows it to reduce production costs while building a worldwide following. Moreover, Nike has spent heavily on research and development to innovate in its respective specialties, and it invests a lot in marketing and maintaining a considerable social media presence.\n\nA big marketing investment is celebrity endorsements from popular athletes in multiple sports. And for all the focus on active athletes, the strategy works with retired athletes as well (perhaps the best example of this strategy is the enduring popularity of the Jordan brand more than two decades after Michael Jordan's NBA retirement).\n\nUnfortunately for Nike, the company's performance has suffered in recent quarters amid a sluggish economy. For the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Nov. 30, 2023), net income of just over $3 billion rose 8% versus the same period last year.\n\nThe stock has struggled to gain traction since reaching its pandemic-driven highs in late 2021. Currently, it sells at a 45% discount from that high.\n\nHowever, it could be poised for a comeback. A refresh of its more popular brands in the spring and the upcoming Summer Olympics could be a marketing win for the company.\n\nAlso, by next year, analysts expect profits to rise by 18%. Such growth could take the sting out of the forward P/E ratio of 28 and spark a long-awaited comeback for Nike stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Guardians of Your Golden Years: 7 Stocks Every Retiree Needs to Own",
        "content": "Investing in your golden years is very different from investing in your young age. You cannot take as much risk now, but you still want to see your money grow. The stock market is a good place to park your funds, but the trick is to choose stocks that pay dividends and have the potential to achieve growth. Long-term investing can generate steady returns, and if you choose the right businesses to invest in, you will see your investment grow over time. If you are a retiree and looking for stocks to invest in, here are top stocks for retirees that will bring stability, passive income and steady growth to your portfolio.\n\nStocks for Retirees: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nA stock for every retiree’s portfolio, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a tech giant that has soared over 250% in the past five years. Trading at $425, the stock is up 14% year-to-date and is set to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) investments.\n\nThe company has already integrated AI into its products and services and expects to start earning returns this year. Its cloud platform, Azure is already a huge hit in the market. The company will launch a generative AI security software to stay ahead of the AI race.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe new service will launch on April 1 and help cybersecurity professionals understand the threats. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, Copilot for Security will be available for general purchase.\n\nFundamentally, Microsoft is a strong company without enough liquidity to keep investing in the business and rewarding shareholders. It enjoys a dividend yield of 0.71%. Microsoft is set for an AI-powered revenue surge this year, and investors are set to benefit.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA highly undervalued Dividend King, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a great stock for a retiree’s portfolio. The healthcare giant has a massive presence across the globe and is set to gain strength after the spin-off of the consumer products segment, Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE).\n\nStory continues\n\nThis will allow JNJ to allocate its resources to high-growth segments. It reported fourth-quarter revenue of $21.4 billion, where the pharmaceutical segment was up 4.2% while the medtech segment was up 13.3%.\n\nJNJ stock is a long-term investment with a dividend yield of 2.99%. Trading at $159, the stock has soared 15% in the past five years. It has seen a slow but steady upside, which makes it a highly resilient stock in times like today.\n\nThe company is leaning on acquisitions to grow its portfolio and that has helped achieve growth. It has enough liquidity to keep investing in businesses while also rewarding shareholders. The management expects annual growth in the range of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nA fintech giant, Visa (NYSE:V) holds a global presence and caters to more than 100 million merchants. The company has become indispensable in our lives, and it has an impressive business model where it earns steady income while keeping the operating costs low.\n\nVisa will earn a fee whenever its card is used. As the world transitions towards a digital economy, card usage will be on the rise, and that is where Visa can benefit.\n\nThe company already has a strong balance sheet and reported net revenue of $8.6 billion in the first quarter results. Its payment volume increased 8% year-over-year (YOY) in the quarter, and the total processed transactions for 2023 stood at $57.5 billion, up 9% YOY.\n\nA dividend stock, Visa has a modest yield of 0.73% and is trading for $286 today. It is up 11% YTD and has soared 34% in the year. It raised the quarterly dividend by 15.6% YOY at the end of 2023.\n\nStocks for Retirees: Caterpillar (CAT) silhouettes of a forklift and driver as well as two workers by a semi truck backdropped by a sunset sky. represents the supply chain\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/By yuttana Contributor Studio\n\nWhile Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is heavily dependent on the state of the economy, it also operates in a sector that will never become outdated — the construction industry. To achieve economic growth, the construction industry will remain crucial.\n\nAs the economy improves, so will Caterpillar’s business. It saw a dip in volume while a rise in revenue in the recent quarter, which could be due to inflation. The company may see ups and downs, but it will continue to remain a strong player in the construction industry. One cannot argue against this sector because it has long-term growth potential.\n\nTrading at $341 today, CAT stock is very close to the 52-week high and is up 16% YTD. It enjoys a dividend yield of 1.52% and is a fundamentally strong business. Its fourth-quarter revenue came in at $17.1 billion, up 3% YOY, and reported a full-year profit of $20.12 billion.\n\nThe company ended the year with $7 billion of enterprise cash and returned $7.5 billion to investors through dividends and share buybacks in 2023.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nE-commerce company Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has come a long way from its modest beginning as a bookseller. The company sells everything today and is no longer just an e-commerce business. AMZN is one of the best stocks for retirees.\n\nIt has steadily expanded its umbrella and has a presence across multiple industries today. That shields the business from the sector’s ups and downs. Amazon’s biggest revenue generator is the cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its advertising segment.\n\nThere is ample growth potential from the current level, and I see AWS gaining a higher market share. It holds a 31% market share currently, and with the growing investment in this sector, we could see it expand.\n\nIt reported impressive quarterly results, generating revenue of $170 billion in the fourth quarter and bringing net sales to $574 billion for 2023.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Empty grocery cart in a grocery store aisle. Consumer goods.\n\nSource: gyn9037 / Shutterstock\n\nA household name, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a dividend stock with a history of increasing dividends for over 65 years. The company established itself as an industry leader and enjoys solid cash flow generation.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it saw a 4% rise in organic sales, driven by the rise in demand across markets in Europe, Latin America and North America. Despite high inflation, PG has shown resilience and organic growth.\n\nIt has a dividend yield of 2.33% and is trading for $161 today. The stock is at its 52-week high and is up 10% YTD. It has generated over 55% returns in the past five years and is steadily rallying upwards.\n\nThe company owns some of the biggest brands and has a presence across multiple countries. It generated $82 billion in sales in 2023 and reiterated the guidance for organic sales growth this year for 4% to 5% while improving the guidance for EPS growth to 8% to 9%.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a popular name across the globe and it enjoys strong brand loyalty. Everyone reading this must have tried at least one Coca-Cola product in their lives. The company is diversifying into tea, healthy beverages and fruit juices to appeal to the changing demands of consumers.\n\nIt is a resilient stock that has been moving in the range of $52 to $64 over the past year. While you might not see a major upside with the stock, it will continue to generate passive income for you. KO is one of the top stocks for retirees.\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.21%, KO stock has increased dividends for over 60 years. It is trading at $60 today and could continue moving sideways. If you are a risk-averse investor looking to own a steady stock, KO is a good choice.\n\nWith over 45% of the market share in global non-alcoholic beverages, Coca-Cola has a strong presence in the industry and is considered a leader. It is hard to beat the company when it comes to sales and revenue.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: I Think This Stock Should Replace It in the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "content": "There's no question that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a tech dynamo for much of its history, and it has delivered monster returns to its long-term investors.\n\nHowever, more recently, the company's results have been mixed. Yes, Amazon stock has nearly doubled over the past year, but that's only because it fell so far in the bear market of 2022. In fact, Amazon still hasn't eclipsed its peak from 2021, even as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are back to setting new all-time highs.\n\nWhile Amazon's recent results have been solid, there are also signs that the company is losing its edge. Revenue growth at its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, has slowed substantially, down to 13% in the fourth quarter, well behind its two biggest rivals, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. Growth in its e-commerce business has slowed to a similar pace, and it's even been outpaced by Walmart.\n\nAmazon also seems like it's gotten off to a slow start in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. It followed Alphabet in making a multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic AI in September, though that move seemed designed to make up for its earlier lack of strategy.\n\nAmazon is a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" the group of the world's most valuable tech companies. Those seven contributed the largest portion of the overall market's share price growth last year. However, Amazon's greatest innovations could be behind it. CEO Andy Jassy seems to have pivoted from experimentation toward a focus on profitability, which could leave the company weaker over the long term. For example, its marketplace sellers are up in arms over a new set of fees that has prompted a Federal Trade Commission investigation.\n\nOne company on the cutting edge of technology that in my view would be a good candidate to replace Amazon in the Magnificent Seven is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM).\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPossibly the world's most important company\n\nIt's no exaggeration to call Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- aka TSMC -- the world's most important company. It's the world's largest chip manufacturer. It handles approximately 55% of contract chip manufacturing and 90% of the most advanced chips, and that share could go even higher.\n\nTSMC is the company that tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, and even Amazon turn to in order to manufacture their chips, giving it tremendous market power. Arguably, no other company would affect the world more if it ceased operations today.\n\nTSMC's market power is also visible in its results. In the fourth quarter, the company generated $8.2 billion in operating income on $19.6 billion in revenue, giving it an operating margin of 42%, a clear demonstration of its pricing power.\n\nTSMC is also vital for generative AI technology, as companies like Nvidia rely on it to produce the cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) and other chips capable of powering and training generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Demand for those chips is vastly outstripping supply, which should drive profits even higher at TSMC.\n\nThere's a clear need to expand chip production, and TSMC has new foundries planned in the U.S. and other parts of the world. However, expansion in the U.S. is running into challenges for several companies, showing that it won't be easy to ramp up the production of chips, especially the most advanced ones.\n\nWhy TSMC should join the Magnificent Seven\n\nTSMC isn't a U.S.-based company like the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Still, it is listed in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange. With a market cap of $721 billion as of March 11, it's now more valuable than Tesla, which means that it would qualify for a spot in the group based on its size.\n\nHowever, the best reason to include TSMC in the Magnificent Seven is that it represents the future of technology. It's the dominant supplier of AI chips and other advanced processors and will almost certainly remain so.\n\nThe company has returned to revenue growth after the last cyclical downturn in the chip industry, and investors are recognizing its crucial position in the AI supply chain -- the stock is up 34% year to date.\n\nTSMC looks like a good bet to outperform Amazon and other members of the Magnificent Seven over the rest of the year. It deserves a spot in the elite group of tech stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A 15-year problem that has plagued corporate America is finally turning around",
        "content": "American workers are becoming more productive.\n\nRecent analysis from Bank of America showed the average revenue per worker for companies in the S&P 500 hit an all-time high in Februaryafter 15 years of no gains. This is one of several signs that labor productivity is rebounding after slumping during 2022.\n\nSome on Wall Street think the developments in labor productivity could help the stock market survive stickier-than-expected inflation that has emerged as a concern in recent weeks.\n\n\"If productivity goes higher, then [companies] are able to cut costs, improve margins, things like that,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon told Yahoo Finance. \"That's why companies are so focused on improving productivity. There's a lot of macro headwinds happening. So they are trying to find ways to improve productivity and sort of offset those headwinds.\"\n\nThe headwinds Kwon references include the risk the Federal Reserve holds off on cutting interest rates as inflation's path downward continues to prove bumpier than initially hoped.Two separate reports released this week showed inflation was hotter than economists expected in February. And annual wage growth during the month was higher than what economists have said the Fed wants to see to feel confident inflation is moving down to its 2% target.\n\nThe research team at Carson Group argues an increase in productivity could offset these concerns, though.\n\n\"With productivity soaring like it is and will hopefully continue like it can, you don't have to worry about inflation coming back, you really don't,\" Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance.\n\nDetrick's colleague Sonu Varghese explained that persistent wage growth can usually cause an inflation problem if consumers have more money to spend on goods. Demand for goods would rise as workers make more money, therefore pushing prices higher. This paradigm shifts, though, if productivity picks up. In that instance, the economy could sustain higher wages because companies would also be producing more goods. If both the demand and supply of goods pick up, then prices can remain stable.\n\nStory continues\n\nVarghese highlighted two different instances where wage growth surged. In the 1970s, wage growth picked up but productivity didn't, leading to a decade-long battle with persistent inflation. In the 1990s, wage growth gains were met with a productivity boom and subsequently led to a prosperous stretch for both US economic growth and stock market gains.\n\nAs productivity picks up, it increases the overall trajectory of the US economic growth, Renaissance Macro head of economic research Neil Dutta told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat's welcome news for stocks.\n\nCompanies can choose to use their increased financial gains from productivity in a variety of ways. One would be to keep boosting wages to lure in more workers. But recent shifts in the labor market show that likely won't be the case.\n\nThe labor market has shown some signs of softening and the large pay bumps needed to lure workers in the post-lockdown job market have eased. The quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, hit its lowest level since August 2020 in January.\n\nThis would indicate that companies would take their additional revenues from increased productivity and use them to boost margins. Higher margins are usually a tailwind for future company earnings, which would in theory lift equities.\n\nAll of this comes without a mention of artificial intelligence, which has been lauded as a potential productivity booster.\n\n\"AI is kind of like the cherry on the top,\" Kwon said. \"AI obviously is going to be a huge productivity enhancer. I don't know when that's going to happen. But we do think that is going to happen and be a huge boost to productivity as well.\" Denver Broncos mascot Thunder, ridden by Ann Judge, crosses the field with the American flag after a touchdown in the first quarter against the Cleveland Browns at Empower Field at Mile High.

        "title": "Analysis: Amazon sellers say their businesses are facing an extinction event—they might not be wrong",
        "content": "This time is different.\n\nIn phone and text conversations with more than 20 longtime US-based Amazon sellers over the last several weeks, that was the common refrain Fortune heard again and again: this time is different.\n\n“This time” refers to the latest class of fees levied on sellers by Amazon. More than 60% of the goods that Amazon sells across the globe are supplied by these small and mid-sized businesses, and Amazon already takes a cut of at least 50% on average from every sale when it handles the storage and shipping of a merchant’s goods.\n\nNow the amount that merchants fork over to Amazon is likely to grow even more thanks to a couple of additional fees that have quickly become controversial enough that the Federal Trade Commission has begun probing them, as Fortune reported exclusively last week. The consistent message that long-time, level-headed sellers are sharing with each other? Selling on Amazon may soon be untenable.\n\nAnd as a result, many of these same business owners are forecasting something of an extinction event for Amazon sellers. The general category of third-party sellers won’t vanish—some hardy types and emergent breeds will always adapt and survive—but for a great many existing sellers, the view is that the climate on planet Amazon may no longer be able to support life as they’ve known it. The only question is which type of seller will be forced out of business (or at least, off of Amazon) first?\n\nWill it be the unsophisticated seller, struggling to predict how the new variable costs will affect its business? If this seller keeps its prices low, it might not realize the damage caused to its financials until it’s too late.\n\nOr consider the plight of the sophisticated seller, who understands what’s coming but finds itself in a bind. This seller may want to raise prices to account for Amazon’s added fees. But that might not be possible if the seller is competing against rivals keeping prices low because they’re either A. too inexperienced to understand the impact of the fees to their bottom lines, or B. based in China, and therefore utilizing Amazon cross-border supply chain services which may help them avoid the new fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn either scenario, things could get ugly.\n\n“People are going to tend to underprice and just erode everyone’s margins,” said Bernie Thompson, who has been selling on Amazon since 2009 and is the founder of a top Amazon seller, the USB electronics brand Plugable. “There are going to be a bunch of bankruptcies.”\n\nAmazon has said that the fee changes are significantly less than those announced by other major fulfillment services, and that many sellers will see a decrease in the average fees paid to Amazon per unit sold.\n\nThe fee changes “allow sellers to choose where they want to have Amazon take on different aspects of fulfillment and where they want to do the work themselves,\" Amazon spokesperson Mira Dix told Fortune last week.\n\nA win-win for Amazon\n\nMany of the sellers who spoke to Fortune understand the rationale of at least one of the fees, known as the “inbound placement fee,” but disagree with the implementation and variability of the fees. In the past, Amazon sellers could ship a selection of their goods from their own warehouse – or one they essentially rent space in – to a single Amazon facility, and then Amazon might split up that inventory and ship to various facilities across the U.S. to get closer to Amazon customers. In these scenarios, Amazon would foot the bill to transport those goods between its own fulfillment centers.\n\nNow, as Amazon pushes to store more goods closer to customers in more U.S. regions while cutting its own costs, Amazon wants sellers to start footing the bill themselves. Amazon will charge sellers a new “inbound placement fee” per item if the seller won’t pay to send their inventory to at least four Amazon facilities. (For smaller sellers who don’t sell enough to even split between four facilities, it means they will likely pay some type of placement fee no matter what.)\n\nThe more warehouses a seller will ship to, the lower the fee. But the per-unit fee will change depending on how many warehouses Amazon makes available to a seller and where those warehouses are located. And only when a seller goes to create a shipment and Amazon displays the fees, can the business owner figure out the cost of shipping to the various warehouses locations to try to select the least expensive option for them.\n\nOne comment from a seller on Amazon’s own seller forum captured some of the frustrations with the new complexities.\n\n“Arghh — I think you need a phD to be able to figure out the fees.” 13 October 2021, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Neubrandenburg: An employee sorts parcels on a conveyor belt in the new distribution center of the online retailer Amazon. The retailer's second distribution centre in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will officially open on 13.10.2021. According to the operator, around 10,000 parcels from European logistics and sorting centres will be unloaded here every day and assigned to delivery vehicles. Photo: Jens Büttner/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa (Photo by Jens Büttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nSome sellers are equally frustrated with a new “low inventory” fee Amazon will charge sellers if they aren’t stocking enough inventory in Amazon warehouses, especially considering Amazon also charges fees if you are storing too much stock in an Amazon facility. Substantial confusion also remains for merchants that sell goods that expire, and thus shouldn’t be stocked too long, or for those that sell seasonal items.\n\nThe catch, of course, with both of the new fees is that there is one straightforward way around them: by paying Amazon for a new-ish warehouse service called Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD) to store long-term inventory. Sign up to use AWD and – voila – the inbound placement and low-inventory fees basically disappear. A pretty clear carrot-and-stick approach, as one seller called it, or a crumb-and-sledgehammer one if you are feeling less diplomatic.\n\nSome sellers told Fortune that they feel AWD is a suitable alternative, but many types of sellers couldn't switch to AWD even if they want to. Oversized products, for example, or products with an expiration date, can’t be stored with AWD. What’s more, some sellers already own or lease their own warehouse for long term storage, or have long term commitments with a third party logistics company that manages a storage facility for them. For them, Switching to AWD anytime soon isn’t a realistic option.\n\nOn the surface, the new fees sure seem like a win-win for Amazon — the company can offset some of its costs through new fees or gain greater control of the supply chain when sellers opt for AWD. The increasing burden on sellers may be so much that many call it quits. But with hundreds of thousands of sellers, it will take a lot of seller failures before Amazon and its shopping experience feel any pain.\n\nAs a reporter who’s been talking to Amazon sellers on a weekly basis for the past decade, I’ve never before encountered this level of outrage and despair. Many of these small and mid-sized businesses – great SMB success stories who typically aren’t afraid to praise the company – are now furious…and desperate. Will Amazon hear their pleas?\n\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq hit a new record high recently, and the good times may be far from over. History shows us that over the past 10 periods of annual market declines -- dating back to the early 1970s -- the index always has climbed for at least two consecutive years afterward. And on all but one occasion, the index posted a double-digit increase during its second year of gains. If this trend continues, the Nasdaq, heading for a 7.4% increase so far, is set to climb higher in 2024.\n\nAnd the stocks that have led the gains and could continue leading the movement are artificial intelligence (AI) players. Investors are excited about this high-growth, high-potential technology. AI may make game-changing moves -- like bringing lifesaving drugs to patients more quickly -- and could save companies and individuals money and time as it completes tasks and solves problems.\n\nThat's why right now is the perfect time to get in on potential AI powerhouses. Let's check out two AI stocks to buy hand over fist before the Nasdaq soars higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is benefiting from AI in two ways. The company uses AI across its e-commerce business to streamline operations and improve the customer experience. And Amazon sells AI solutions to customers through Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon's AI will help you choose a product based on your buying history, and AI is helping the company choose the best delivery routes for packages. These and other AI efforts should keep customers coming back and boost Amazon's profitability.\n\nAs for AWS, the service offers everything from chips for customers to train their own AI models to a fully managed service that allows customers to customize the most popular large language models (LLMs) to suit their needs. AWS customers can access the company's own lower-cost chips, as well as the fastest, highest-performing chips and services from AI chip market leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this could make Amazon one of the winners of a potential AI revolution. And Amazon already has a solid earnings track record -- so the company has the resources to invest in this hot area and continue to grow. In the most recent quarter, Amazon's net sales rose in the double digits, and operating income more than quadrupled to surpass $13 billion.\n\nToday, the stock trades for 42x times forward earnings estimates, a fair price for an already solid business with top AI prospects.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia holds 80% of the AI chip market, and though it faces competitors in the space, it's unlikely to lose its lead any time soon for two reasons. First, the company's first-to-market advantage and brand strength should keep at least some customers loyal. Second, Nvidia is pouring investment into research and development to stay ahead.\n\nInvestors expect the launch of Nvidia's H200 chip in the second quarter and then potentially the launch of the Blackwell architecture along with the B100 chip later in the year. These newer products are improvements on the company's already fastest-on-the-market chip.\n\nBut Nvidia doesn't only design chips. The company also offers a full portfolio of products and services for the AI client, including a software platform that serves as an \"operating system\" for AI. Nvidia products are offered on AWS, as mentioned, but also through all other major cloud providers. So it's easy for customers to access Nvidia's offerings directly through their cloud service.\n\nNvidia's earnings have soared, but growth may be far from over considering the company's market leadership -- and likelihood of remaining on top. Today, Nvidia trades for 35x times forward earnings estimates, which seems reasonable for such a solid growth stock. That's why Nvidia makes a no-brainer addition to any AI portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nTripAdvisor Q4 Earnings & Revenues Beat, Rise Y/Y\n\nTripAdvisor reported non-GAAP fourth-quarter 2023 earnings of 38 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 72.7%. The bottom line significantly jumped from the prior-year quarter’s figure of 7 cents.\r\n\r\nRevenues of $390 million increased 10% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $372.9 million.\r\n\r\nTop-line growth was driven by strong momentum in the Viator segment. A well-performing TheFork segment also benefited the company.\r\n\r\nHowever, weakness in hotel meta offerings in Europe was a concern.\n\nQuarterly Details\n\nTripAdvisor reports revenues under three segments: Tripadvisor Core, Viator and TheFork.\r\n\r\nTripadvisor Core: Revenues summed $218 million (accounting for 55.9% of revenues), up 0.5% year over year. The figure came above the consensus mark of $208 million. Media and advertising revenues jumped 6% year over year to $35 million.\r\n\r\nRevenues from Tripadvisor experiences and dining were $38 million, increasing 12% year over year. Other revenues within the segment were $10 million, which remained flat year over year.\r\n\r\nHowever, revenues from Tripadvisor-branded hotels decreased 4% year over year to $135 million due to a decline in European hotel meta offering.\r\n\r\nViator: Revenues totaled $161 million (41.3%). The figure increased 27% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $156 million.\r\n\r\nTheFork: Revenues came in at $39 million (10%), increasing 18% year over year. The figure was above the consensus mark of $37.7 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating Results\n\nTripAdvisor’s selling and marketing costs decreased 7.7% year over year to $179 million.\r\n\r\nGeneral and administrative costs were down 18.9% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $47 million.\r\n\r\nTechnology and content costs of $68 million increased 13.4% on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nTRIP reported operating income of $31 million in the reported quarter against $13 million of operating loss in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, the total adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.5%, which expanded 940 bps on a year-over-year basis.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $1.07 billion compared with $1.12 billion as of Sep 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nLong-term debt stood at $839 million at the end of the fourth quarter, which remained flat compared with the previous quarter’s figure.\r\n\r\nTripadvisor used $19 million of cash in operations in the reported quarter against $14 million of cash generated from operations in the prior quarter.\r\n\r\nFree cash outflow was $35 million in the fourth quarter.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -1734.29% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, TripAdvisor has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nTripAdvisor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nTripAdvisor is part of the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. Over the past month, Amazon (AMZN), a stock from the same industry, has gained 5.3%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2023 more than a month ago.\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nAmazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of A.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Amazon (AMZN): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs AMZN a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.2% over the past month to $4.08.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Retail sales rebounded in February after an unexpected decline in January, following a solid holiday season. The Commerce Department said on Mar 14 that retail sales increased 0.6% in February on a month-over-month basis.\n\nFebruary's rise came after a 1.1% decline in January. Although retail sales fell short of the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.8%, last month's rebound once again proves that consumers are spending lavishly.\n\nYear over year, retail sales grew 1.5% in February as inflation has declined substantially over the past year.\n\nRetail sales increased across a large number of segments in February. Sales at garden equipment and building material stores increased 2.2%. Receipts at motor vehicles and parts dealers rose 1.6%, while sales at gasoline stations climbed 0.6%. Sales at electronics and appliances outlets grew 1.5%.\n\nCore retail sales, which excludes automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services costs, remained unchanged month over month in February. Core retail sales for January were revised down to 0.3% from 0.4%.\n\nInflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The consumer price index rose 3.2% year over year in February. However, consumer spending, which has been driving the retail sector, remains rock solid. The U.S. economy grew 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Also, the Atlanta Fed has projected 2.5% annualized GDP growth for the first quarter.\n\nOur Picks\n\nGiven the encouraging economic environment and increase in retail sales, it would be prudent for savvy investors to consider betting on retail stocks like Amazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "By Marta Fiorin and Inti Landauro\n\nBRUSSELS, March 15 (Reuters) - A shop has opened in Brussels selling still-sealed unwanted Amazon parcels by the kilo, effectively a lottery ticket which could win the holder a connected watch, a smartphone - or a worthless trinket.\n\nThe shop called \"Pile ou Face\", French for \"Heads or Tails\", is located near the central square Place Flagey and offers the parcels at 16 euros ($17.40) per kilo. Customers pick a box among the dozens stored in the shop and some open them on the spot.\n\n\"It is like gambling. I paid 40 euros and I got three or four headphones, I did a good job,\" said Paul, who declined to give his last name.\n\nGisele Peeters is a bit disappointed, though. Her 14.40 euro parcel contained an old-style telephone with a dial. \"It's not something I would have bought. I'll try to resell it,\" she said.\n\nArnaud Userstam, who founded the shop, said connected watches and smartphones are the items people are happiest to get, but others return home with clothes, or sometimes especially weird items.\n\n\"A lady got 100 toothbrushes for dogs,\" he said.\n\nUserstam started the business after he and his wife wondered what happened with parcels with delivery problems after experiencing the issue themselves. They found out other similar shops existed elsewhere.\n\nPile ou Face signed contracts with the giant U.S. e-retailer Amazon in Europe to get parcels that were not retrieved from pickup places, that were returned by customers or simply got lost.\n\nUserstam did not elaborate on the contracts, though he said that previously these parcels were just destroyed.\n\n($1 = 0.9188 euros) (Reporting by Marta Fiorin and Inti Landauro, Editing by Charlotte Van Campenhout and Toby Chopra)",

        "title": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Ranked From Cheapest to Most Expensive",
        "content": "For more than a year, Wall Street has been putting smiles on most investors' faces. Following bear market declines in 2022 for the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite, all three major stock indexes have powered their way to record-closing highs in 2024.\n\nAlthough there's no shortage of factors that have fed the current bull market, such as a lower inflation rate and the continued strength of the U.S. economy, much of the heavy lifting has fallen on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's most influential businesses\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most prominent businesses on the planet in terms of both aggregate sales and innovation. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from handily outperforming all three major stock indexes over long periods, the Magnificent Seven offer sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is the dominant provider of desktop operating systems (Windows) and has seen its share of global cloud infrastructure service spend jump to 25%, thanks to Azure. Apple's iPhone has accounted for around half or more of the U.S. smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable. The company has also bought back a jaw-dropping $651 billion of its own stock in 11 years. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a virtual monopoly (90%-plus share) of GPUs in use in high-compute data centers this year. Amazon leads in two categories. It's the far-and-away biggest player in e-commerce and held a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend via Amazon Web Services (AWS), as of September 2023. Alphabet's Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search, with close to 92% of worldwide share in February. Alphabet also owns the second-most-visited social site (YouTube) and the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms is the owner of Facebook, the most visited social site in the world. Collectively, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and other apps, Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users to its social media \"real estate.\" Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs) and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues MSFT Chart\n\nWhile all seven of these components have been phenomenal long-term investments, their outlooks going forward could differ greatly -- and that all starts with their valuations.\n\nRanking the Magnificent Seven stocks from cheapest to priciest using a common valuation tool\n\nTo be upfront, analyzing the valuations of public companies can be subjective. What one investor believes is pricey, another might view as an incredible deal. Likewise, fundamental metrics are fluid and constantly changing as companies report their operating results and Wall Street analysts react to this data.\n\nNevertheless, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has stood the test of time as the most rudimentary measure of value for public companies. But since Wall Street is forward-looking, utilizing the forward P/E ratio, which takes into account consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the upcoming year, makes the most sense.\n\nBased on consensus estimates from Wall Street, as of the closing bell on March 13, here's how the Magnificent Seven ranked from cheapest to priciest using this common valuation tool:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 17.83 forward P/E ratio Meta Platforms: 21.56 Apple: 23.9 Nvidia: 30.43 Microsoft: 31.07 Amazon: 33.95 Tesla: 41.14\n\nTo offer some context, the forward P/E ratios for the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq 100 are 21.1 and 31.32, respectively.\n\nBased purely on earnings potential for the coming year, Amazon and Tesla appear relatively pricey, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms look like bargains. The latter is particularly interesting, given that Meta has more than quintupled since its 2022 bear market bottom yet remains attractively valued, based on consensus EPS estimates for the company.\n\nHowever, the forward P/E ratio doesn't provide the most complete story in terms of valuation. While it can be a helpful tool for assessing mature businesses, an even better measure of value exists for the generally faster-growing and innovation-driven Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the smartest way to rank the Magnificent Seven from cheapest to most expensive\n\nIn addition to being dominant within their respective industries, the Magnificent Seven share another trait: They tend to reinvest a sizable percentage of their operating cash flow back into their respective businesses. In other words, they're willing to forgo maximum profits in the short term to invest in higher-growth initiatives that could really fuel their growth rates years down the road.\n\nRather than relying on the forward P/E ratio, analyzing the multiple that each company trades at relative to its forward-year consensus cash flow is a considerably smarter way to value these dominant businesses.\n\nHere's how the Magnificent Seven stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive when examined relative to next year's cash flow:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 12.53 times next year's cash consensus cash flow Amazon: 12.8 Meta Platforms: 13.19 Apple: 21.1 Microsoft: 24.15 Tesla: 27.38 Nvidia: 30.59\n\nOn one hand, Microsoft, Tesla, and especially Nvidia are making it tougher for growth seekers to find value. Tesla's operating margin is falling as it slashes prices on its production models in order to keep inventory levels under control. Meanwhile, Nvidia is set to face a laundry list of headwinds -- including AI GPU competition from many of its top customers (which are Magnificent Seven components).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Amazon is historically inexpensive, relative to its future cash flow. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of net sales, Amazon could see its cash-flow growth handily outpace its annual sales growth. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms confirms that it's still a potential bargain at just 13 times forward-year cash flow.\n\nBut the best deal within the Magnificent Seven is Alphabet, which also happens to be the cheapest constituent when using the forward P/E ratio.\n\nAlphabet's foundational operating segment continues to be Google. With a nearly 92% share of worldwide internet search, Google is the logical go-to for advertisers looking to target their message(s) to specific consumers. More often than not, this will give Google exceptionally strong ad-pricing power.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet's advertising segments benefiting from long-winded economic expansions, Google Cloud looks like a force to be reckoned with. After years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered its first operating profit in 2023.\n\nCloud service margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and enterprise cloud spending is likely in its early innings. In short, this segment may be Alphabet's prime source of cash-flow growth throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nIf you're looking for a deal among the Magnificent Seven stocks, the data suggests you can't go wrong with Alphabet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Believe It or Not, Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) Still Isn’t Expensive",
        "content": "Chipmaker and AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its unstoppable upward journey, having more than tripled in value in 2023 and up about 78% year-to-date. The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.\n\nNVDA Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings Yet Again\n\nNow the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share handily beat the analysts’ estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago.\n\nImportantly, NVDA’s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.\n\nAs expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters.\n\nLooking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%.\n\nExuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, “We’re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing… [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term Trajectory Remains Impressive\n\nNVDA is Wall Street’s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia’s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What’s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA’s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.\n\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone. These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.\n\nNVDA Could Likely Go for a Stock Split\n\nInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn’t inherently alter the company’s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.\n\nOther prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple’s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.\n\nFurthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.\n\nInterestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA’s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying NVDA for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.\n\nThe insatiable demand for all things AI far outpaces the available supply, underscoring the potential for accelerated computing and generative AI adoption across various industries and regions. This trend is anticipated to be a primary driver of revenue and earnings growth for NVDA in the years ahead.\n\nWith NVDA’s highly anticipated live GTC conference scheduled for March 18-21, my bullish outlook on the company remains steadfast, prompting me to purchase shares at their current levels.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "In this article, we will be covering the 25 poorest states in the US in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Poorest States in the US in 2024.\n\nPoverty Across the US: An Analysis\n\nAs reported by the US Census Bureau, the official US poverty rate was 11.5% in 2022, with 37.9 million Americans in poverty. Although the rate has not changed substantially since the preceding year, it is still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 10.5%. Age-wise, the population aged below 18 years had higher poverty rates than 18 to 64-year-olds and those aged above 65 years. Simultaneously, the poverty rate for those without a high school diploma was 25.2%, significantly higher than for those with at least a bachelor’s degree. Region-wise, the Midwestern states were in the middle poverty category, except for Minnesota which had a poverty rate of only 9.6%. In the West, one state was in the highest poverty category while two states were in the lowest. In the South, seven states had a poverty rate of 15% or more.\n\nThe rise in poverty in the US can be attributed to several reasons. Inflation and soaring costs of living built financial pressure, ultimately moving many families into the category of poor. US states with the highest inflation rates have also been previously covered. Demographics further aggravate the poverty situation. An analysis of Mississippi, one of the poorest US states, reveals that regions in the state that have the highest levels of poverty are those that host the largest Black populations. The inequality is evident from the fact that Black state residents tend to be thrice more likely to be poor than Whites.\n\nIncome serves as a major indicator of poverty since the poverty rate is based on the proportion of people who have their personal or family income below their poverty threshold. In 2022, 6.1% of the U.S. population had income below 50% of their poverty threshold. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas are some of the states that held the highest proportion of people with an income-to-poverty ratio below 50%. Furthermore, individuals living in near poverty were in high numbers in Mississippi and Arkansas. You can also view the top US states by median household income.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile certain states continue to be a victim of inequalities and poverty, other states lead their way with improved economic conditions. States that boast some of the lowest poverty rates include Minnesota, Washington, and Maryland. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Marriott International Inc. (NYSE:MAR) are some of the renowned firms operating in the aforementioned states that continue to work for economic prosperity across the country.\n\nCompanies Working for Economic Prosperity in the US\n\nTarget Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a leading retail corporation that operates stores in all 50 US states. The company is headquartered in Minnesota which has a low poverty rate of 9.6%. The company engages with the local communities to improve their economic well-being. As a part of its philanthropic efforts, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) gives clothing, essentials, and holiday gifts to those in need. The retailer reported that it has also committed to invest $100 million through 2025 to support economic prosperity in Black communities, a group particularly vulnerable to poverty, across the United States.\n\nWashington is known for its strong economic performance since the state boasts a high labor productivity. The poverty rate in the state is 10%. The state hosts many multinational companies including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has added $205 billion to Washington’s GDP. As of January, 87,000 full-time and part-time jobs have been created by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the state. The firm has also enabled more than 11,000 independent sellers in Washington to sell in the company’s store. You can also take a look at some of the most productive states in the US.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is an American hospitality firm based in Maryland where only 9.6% of the population lives below the poverty line. Through investment and volunteer activities, the firm supports local communities and community organizations. The TakeCare Relief Fund which is sponsored by the company provided nearly $570,000 in funding to the Greater Washington Community Foundation. In 2022, it also offered over $2.6 million in more than 4,500 needs-based individual grants to associates. The company also contributed $15 million in cash donations. As of 2022, Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has engaged in more than 8.9 million volunteer hours.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s move to the 25 poorest states in the US in 2024. 25 Poorest States in the US in 2024\n\n25 Poorest States in the US in 2024\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile our list of the 25 poorest states in the US in 2024, we sourced data from the US Census Bureau. We proceeded by choosing the per capita income and the poverty rate. We chose the 25 states with the lowest per capita incomes. We have also incorporated the poverty rates as another metric, for a better analysis. The poverty rate refers to the percentage of the population below the poverty level. Although the title demands 2024 data, the most recent official data available was from 2022 and hence, we utilized that for our research. We have only included states with a poverty rate higher than the official poverty rate of 11.5% in 2022. Poverty rates have also been sourced from the US Census Bureau.\n\nFinally, we ranked the 25 poorest states in the US in descending order of per capita income, supplemented by their respective poverty rates in 2022.\n\n25 Poorest States in the US in 2024\n\n25.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN teamed up with Eli Lilly LLY to expand its footprint in pharmacy efforts.\r\n\r\nPer the terms, Lilly has selected Amazon Pharmacy for the home delivery of drug prescriptions that are sent to its direct-to-consumer service, LillyDirect.\r\n\r\nThis service is limited to certain drugs, which include medications for diabetes, obesity and migraine.\r\n\r\nThis deal, which is meant to provide timely access to prescribed medicines for chronic diseases, remains crucial in the healthcare industry, as cases of diabetes and obesity are continuously increasing, because of which the risk of cardiovascular disease is rising at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the partnership is expected to be beneficial for both companies. Lilly will be able to address the increasing customer demand for its medicines seamlessly on the back of Amazon’s ultrafast delivery speed.\r\n\r\nThen again, Amazon Pharmacy will be able to expand its reach to patients, which, in turn, will benefit its online retail business — the key growth driver for Amazon.\r\n\r\nAMZN has gained 86% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 55.8%.\r\n\r\nIn fourth-quarter 2023, the company’s online store sales came in at $70.54 billion, up 9% year over year.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon’s Aggressive Stance on Pharma Retail\n\nAmazon remains well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects in the online pharmacy market on the back of its aggressive efforts.\r\n\r\nPer a report from Statista, the market is expected to generate revenues of $52.51 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to hit $81.37 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2024 and 2028.\r\n\r\nAmazon Pharmacy, which is considered to be the first of its kind, is accessible via the Amazon app. It allows customers to place their medicine orders with the help of a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider.\r\n\r\nIt offers door-to-door delivery of the ordered medicines, along with free two-day delivery to Prime members.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers are allowed to upload their insurance information securely on their pharmacy profile on the Amazon app and opt for the payment mode before checking out.\r\n\r\nThe company’s introduction of RxPass, a Prime membership benefit, is another plus. It enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible medications for one flat monthly fee of $5 and get them delivered for free.\r\n\r\nThe company recently launched the drone delivery of medicines from Amazon Pharmacy, which is a major positive. Amazon Pharmacy promises to drop a package within 60 minutes of order placement.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts will not only aid its online store sales but also will drive growth in its subscription revenues, thanks to pharmacy related Prime perks. This, in turn, will likely drive Amazon’s overall top-line growth.\r\n\r\nFor first-quarter 2024, Amazon expects net sales between $138 billion and $143.5 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 8-13% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $142.42 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the retail-wholesale sector are eBay EBAY and The Kroger Co. KR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\neBay has gained 20.7% on a year-to-date basis.

        "title": "Walmart Proved It's A Worthy Opponent To Both Amazon And Google",
        "content": "Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) already made a big success after it eased concerns over being smashed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN). Then it kicked off 2024 by showing its AI-powered-search engine contribution to the grocery shopping revolution with which it entered the long-dominated territory of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nRetail-centered generative AI search engine is giving Google a run for its money.\n\nWalmart bravely entered the field that Google has dominated since the very beginning. Although Google is not threatened directly as its search engine is used far beyond retail, Walmart’s success still could inflict harm on the world's most widely used search engine. Instead of sending users to Google and other online destinations, Walmart has been using generative AI as of January to help users arrange an event, taking into account location, search history, and other contextual information. During the unveiling preview in January, Walmart also hinted at developing a generative AI-powered search feature where users would be able to ask for a themed party and receive all the relevant items as a result.\n\nWhat also helped Walmart is that Alphabet and Google released Gemini generative AI before it was ready at the same time. But despite acknowledging the mistake, Alphabet continues to commit significant funds and efforts to further develop Gemini along with more specialized AI tools to integrate within retail ecosystems, such as Conversational Commerce tools from Google Cloud that allows businesses to use virtual AI-powered customers service agents.\n\nBut the bottom line is that Walmart is only doing what everyone else is, led by titans such as Amazon. For example, Amazon users can converse with an AI shopping assistant about what they need instead of searching for specific products. It just pulled it off quickly and is using the technology wisely.\n\nAutomatic replenishment feature.\n\nMoreover, Walmart is envisioning a future where grocery shopping is done hands-free, such as a fully stocked fridge that magically replenishes itself. AI-powered InHome replenishment service aims to automate the entire grocery shopping process, based on the combination of individual consumer habits and Walmart's extensive knowledge of general shopping patterns. If successful, Walmart will be surpassing Amazon and its Subscribe-and-Save model as Amazon is yet to utilize AI for this purpose.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart took its place in the gen-AI era in the making.\n\nWhat should worry Google and Amazon is the speed at which Walmart employed generative AI to enhance its offerings, breaking the pattern of everyone going to Google for everything. Generative AI is democratizing opportunities that used to be unavailable and Walmart has successfully positioned itself as an innovator, worthy of being next to the titans themselves such as Google and Amazon.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.\n\nAnother change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.  reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.\n\nHowever, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.\n\nThis wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:\n\nSince the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.\n\nWith these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). 13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we ranked all components of the Dow 30 stock index by the average share price percentage upside. Out of these, the stocks with the highest upside were selected. Data for the price targets was sourced from Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor these undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\n13. Verizon Communications Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best Guru stocks. If you want to skip our discussion on the ETF industry, head directly to 5 Best Guru Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to outperform the broader market by investing in high-conviction ideas from a select group of hedge funds. It tracks the Solactive Guru Index to mirror the performance of this strategy. Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) provides an opportunity for regular investors to access the investment choices of major hedge funds. By investing alongside these funds, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) aims to leverage their research and knowledge to beat US equity benchmarks like the S&P 500. Unlike traditional hedge fund investments that incur a 2% management fee and a 20% profit share, Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU) has a relatively lower expense ratio of 0.75%, potentially making it a more cost-effective option while still offering access to hedge fund strategies. The ETF was launched on June 4, 2012, and currently has net assets exceeding $42 million, along with a portfolio of 61 stocks.\n\nAccording to BlackRock, investors are expected to increase their use of ETF strategies to potentially outperform the market in the future. The growth of ETFs is closely linked to investors' adoption of index investments as foundational strategies. This shift is partly based on the idea, popularized in academia some time ago, that the costs associated with stock selection can eat into long-term returns. Investors are increasingly opting for transparent fee structures based on assets under management, rather than indirect fees through brokerage commissions and retrocessions. This fee-based wealth advisory approach is also beginning to gain traction in Europe, with regulations like the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, introduced in 2018, shedding light on commissions and retrocessions charged by fund companies, private banks, and independent financial advisors. With MiFID II requiring advisors to disclose all upfront and ongoing fees to clients, transparency is becoming a key focus. In the future, there is expected to be increased demand for lower-cost index products, leading to greater adoption of ETFs in advisory services. This environment would favor ETFs as core components of portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, bond liquidity, which many institutions once took for granted, is decreasing. BlackRock observed significant growth potential for bond ETFs as institutions find it increasingly challenging to access individual bonds. To facilitate large transactions, investors are more likely to use bond ETFs alongside or instead of individual securities. Bond ETFs also enable efficient trading of bundles of securities that would otherwise be challenging and costly to access individually. For example, trading individual emerging market bonds from over 50 countries can be up to 65 times more expensive than using an ETF that tracks an index.\n\nIn this article, we specifically discuss the best Guru stocks, which include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we filtered out the 12 best stocks out of The Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSE:GURU)’s portfolio of 61 holdings as of March 11 based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

(NYSE:SPGI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) increased due to higher debt issuance amid more favorable market conditions. Billed issuance rose 47% in October and 26% in November against subdued levels last year, with issuance boosted by declining interest rates and tighter bond spreads. Positive equity market performance in the fourth quarter benefited asset-based fees. In addition, the company reported strong quarterly financial results with double-digit growth in revenue and earnings and raised full-year earnings guidance. We continue to own the stock due to the company’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”\n\n10. Snowflake Inc.

(NYSE:SNOW), a cloud-based data platform company, is positioned well to help enterprises better leverage their own data to get the most out of AI models.

(NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n7. Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…”\n\n6.

        "title": "Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Up Recently?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock increased significantly by 20% over the past three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n15% = US$30b ÷ US$202b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.15.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Amazon.com's Earnings Growth And 15% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. Yet, the fact that the company's ROE is lower than the industry average of 21% does temper our expectations. Although, we can see that Amazon.com saw a modest net income growth of 5.7% over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 14% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Amazon.com Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like Amazon.com has some positive aspects to its business. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a moderate rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy in 2024, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts -- Surprise! It's Not Nvidia",
        "content": "There's little question that Nvidia has been the early winner in the race to adopt artificial intelligence (AI). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven remarkably adept at AI applications, thanks in part to their ability to conduct a multitude of mathematical computations simultaneously, thereby speeding the processing of AI models.\n\nThe demand for these chips has spread like wildfire, resulting in triple-digit year-over-year profit and revenue growth for Nvidia over the past three quarters. As a result, its shares have gained an incredible 500% since early 2023 (as of this writing).\n\nDespite its early lead, there are those who believe that other AI stocks will have more staying power. One of the top picks among analysts is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and there's evidence that suggests the company will benefit from the growing adoption of generative AI for years to come. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA growing chorus on Wall Street\n\nSome of the biggest names on Wall Street have chosen Amazon as the best AI stock to own in the coming year.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth chose Amazon as his \"best idea\" for 2024, citing accelerating growth at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the increasing contribution of generative AI. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion also joined the fray, calling out Amazon as his top pick for 2024, crediting strong momentum in cloud computing driven by AI. Citi analyst Ronald Josey also called Amazon his top pick, citing \"cost reductions and optimizations.\" Analysts at Bernstein named Amazon their \"Best Idea\" for 2024, pointing to fixed-cost leverage and margin strength. TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge chose Amazon as his top large-cap internet pick, singling out the potential for AWS to reaccelerate its revenue growth thanks to AI. Roth MKM analyst Rohit Kulkarni called Amazon its \"Top Mega Cap pick for 2024,\" suggesting it's the only megacap he expects to deliver \"accelerating revenues and expanding operating margins\" this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith so many analysts flocking to Amazon, let's look at how AI could move the needle for the company over the coming year.\n\nA long track record\n\nAmazon has a long and distinguished history of developing AI algorithms to advance its business interests. When consumers are searching for products on Amazon's website, AI is working behind the scenes to surface the items that best match the search terms. The same goes for those looking for movies on Amazon Prime Video or songs on Prime Music. AI also manages the placement of targeted adverting on the company's e-commerce website.\n\nAI has also helped Amazon climb to the top of the hill in e-commerce. AI-fueled software keeps track of inventory at its warehouses and distribution centers and adjusts levels to keep up with changing demand. AI-powered robots ferry products around the warehouse for picking and packing once they've been ordered. Amazon's in-house algorithms also schedule delivery routes to squeeze the maximum number of deliveries out of each gallon of fuel.\n\nYet this laundry list of AI enhancements is just the beginning for Amazon, which is ramping up its capabilities and already embracing generative AI.\n\nHead in the clouds\n\nImproving its business operations aside, the biggest opportunity for Amazon is acting as a provider of AI services to its cloud infrastructure customers. And the company has already hit the ground running.\n\nAWS Bedrock offers a suite of all the most common AI models, while also helping customers build customized AI apps. It also offers access to Nvidia's flagship AI chips -- the H200 Tensor Core GPUs -- and Amazon's own Inferentia and Trainium AI chips, which the company says gives customers more bang for their buck. In doing so, Amazon provides AI processing to fit every budget.\n\nAmazon has also developed a number of generative AI options that will benefit customers. The company recently launched Amazon Q for enterprises, a digital assistant powered by generative AI that helps streamline and automate mundane and time-consuming tasks, helping users be more productive. Amazon also introduced a tool that uses AI to develop images for advertisers, and another that aids consumers in their search for products.\n\nAWS has long been the frontrunner in cloud infrastructure services, and while its growth has slowed, many analysts believe generative AI will provide the jump-start it needs to reinvigorate its growth. Several months ago, Needham analyst Laura Martin dropped a bombshell. She suggested that providing cloud AI services to AWS customers will prove so lucrative, it will vault Amazon's market cap above $3 trillion, or 63% above its current level. The catalyst? The large language models (LLMs) that underlie its AI efforts, according to Martin: \"Not only do [cloud infrastructure leaders] LLMs have the lowest cost structures and first-mover advantages, but their average lifetime value per cloud customer is about to skyrocket owing to the stickiness of apps built on their LLMs.\"\n\nThis suggests there's still plenty of upside for Amazon stock, all thanks to generative AI.\n\nAll that opportunity for a bargain-basement price\n\nDespite the wealth of opportunity ahead, Amazon stock is still selling for a song, at just 2 times next year's sales.\n\nGiven the ongoing rebounds in online retail and digital adverting, the vast generative AI opportunity, and Amazon's bargain-basement price, it's easy to see why Amazon is a top AI pick for 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "GM Stock’s Mispricing Is Your Chance to Snag a Blue-Chip Bargain Before the Crowd Catches On",
        "content": "If any U.S. automaker is underappreciated right now, it’s General Motors (NYSE:GM). The company grew its vehicle sales by 14.1% year over year in 2023. That’s not too shabby — yet, GM stock is surprisingly cheap and value seekers should quit hesitating and start buying.\n\nBesides, General Motors is an audacious automaker with a multinational presence in the electric vehicle industry. In addition, General Motors is venturing into a software niche market that could prove lucrative. So, when everything is considered, it is a brilliant move to invest in General Motors in 2024.\n\nWhat’s General Motors up to Now? You’ll Be Surprised!\n\nGeneral Motors is an old company, but it continues to try out new concepts. For example, General Motors is teaming up with automotive supplier Magna and technology services and consulting company Wipro to develop an automotive software marketplace.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis digital marketplace will play the “matchmaker” among automotive software buyers and sellers (primarily businesses, not individual consumers). It will be called SDVerse, and as I see it, this could be the equivalent of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a niche industry.\n\nGeneral Motors is making headway in the market — not only in the U.S., but internationally. The automaker announced that General Motors’ luxury-focused Cadillac Lyriq is again eligible for a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S. The Lyriq became eligible for the tax credit again after General Motors made a after a battery-sourcing change.\n\nIn addition, General Motors recently expanded into the European market when it unveiled the Lyriq in France. General Motors already offers the Lyriq in Switzerland. According to Reuters, General Motors “is due to launch” the Lyriq “in other European markets, starting with Germany by year-end.”\n\nGM Stock Is Too Cheap to Ignore\n\nThe market doesn’t fully appreciate the growth potential of General Motors in the 2020s. While some other automakers have high valuation multiples, General Motors stock is an overlooked gem for bargain hunters.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra actually spoke upon this topic in a recent interview. “A lot of companies have high price/earnings multiples based on what they are saying the future will be. We have to prove what our future will be, and that is what we have set out to do,” Barra stated.\n\nIndeed, General Motors still has some proving to do in 2024. For the time being, though, General Motors has an ultralow GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 5.4x (versus the sector median P/E ratio of 17.83x). The automaker also has a non-GAAP forward P/E ratio of 4.45x (the sector median is 15.53x).\n\nDoes the market not know or care that General Motors was last year’s top-selling automaker in the U. S.? Perhaps, stock traders are so busy obsessing about the “Magnificent Seven” that they just aren’t aware of General Motors’ supreme value.\n\nGM Stock: A Smart Play for Proud Cheapskates\n\nGeneral Motors isn’t just a legacy automaker. The company is quite modern and ambitious as it expands its global EV-market presence and helps to develop an automotive software marketplace.\n\nGeneral Motors is a overlooked U.S. automotive-industry icon. Instead of just taking General Motors for granted, consider buying GM stock while it’s still cheap. After all, cheapskates often get the best deals on Wall Street and book big profits in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon Says It Sold Ads For Products Shoppers Couldn’t Buy",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has pledged to make fixes to its advertising operation after mistakenly charging online merchants to promote products shoppers couldn’t purchase.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSpaceX Starship Nears Orbit, But Is Lost Before Return to Earth Millennium Trader Scored $40 Million Windfall in Egypt FX Plunge Biden’s Best Shot Against Trump Lies in ‘Blue Wall’ States Putin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for Russia Bond Yields Jump as Hot Inflation Curbs Fed Wagers: Markets Wrap\n\nThe problem came to light when a seller of advanced gaming computers discovered he was being charged thousands of dollars to advertise merchandise in California even though he had stopped selling his products there. Rob Robinson says Amazon’s automated advertising system continued to promote his merchandise in the state even though customers couldn’t order it. Because he was being charged for ads that weren’t generating sales, Robinson says he made zero profit in November, December and January. Despite Robinson flagging the issue for several weeks, Amazon initially denied there was a problem.\n\nAfter Bloomberg described the small business owner’s experience, the company acknowledged that he and other sellers paid for misdirected advertisements and that it was working to fix the problem. The company said it had apologized to Robinson and offered him a $15,000 refund—a fraction of the $300,000 he is seeking. Amazon declined to elaborate on the breadth of the problem beyond saying it “affected a tiny fraction” of sellers. “We will similarly contact and refund any affected sellers, and are updating our processes to ensure any such ads are not charged going forward,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe stumble highlights a limitation of Amazon’s fast-growing and lucrative advertising business. Geographic targeting is a standard feature offered by competitors, including Meta Platforms Inc. and market leader Google, which for years has enabled companies to target users by location for searches like pizza joints, plumbers and psychiatrists. Amazon’s advertising business mostly focuses on matching shoppers with what they want without considering geography—and that’s why shoppers saw ads for Robinson’s products but couldn’t order them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has an incentive to get a handle on the problem. In an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the US Federal Trade Commission accused Amazon of boosting profits by selling irrelevant ads that degrade the customer experience. When shoppers in California clicked on Robinson’s computer ads, Amazon didn’t explain why the products weren’t available. It just said they couldn’t be delivered to their address and suggested that customers “choose a different delivery location.”\n\n“Amazon created a situation where sellers can be charged for useless traffic, and it needs to be addressed,” said Yoni Mazor, founder of GETIDA, which provides consulting services to online merchants. “It could be a much larger problem than anybody realizes.”\n\nRobinson owns Computer Upgrade King, which sells computers and accessories to gamers. The firm employs about 80 people at two locations near Richmond, Virginia, including dozens of technicians who assemble custom computers using components from manufacturers such as Intel and Nvidia. Most of its merchandise is currently sold on Amazon’s online marketplace\n\nRobinson started getting notices from Amazon last year that some of his products were “restricted from sale in certain locations, although they are permissible for listing on Amazon.” Robinson knew regulations governing personal computer power consumption were rolling out in California and was content to sacrifice sales there to avoid paying for costly lab reports for the hundreds of specialized products he sells.\n\nRobinson started to detect problems with his Amazon account in November when his sales dropped and he didn’t turn a profit despite having a robust advertising budget. After investigating, he realized his ads were being displayed to California shoppers who couldn’t buy his products. On top of that, his advertisements were being shown nationwide on Amazon Business, a specialized marketplace designed for corporate and institutional procurement. Amazon had suspended sales of some products due to unusual activity on his account, but was still charging Robinson to advertise the blocked items. The company subsequently lifted the suspension and acknowledged overcharging Robinson.\n\nAt the time, Robinson said, “we were basically building computers for free.”\n\nAmazon considered the potential for misplaced ads more than a decade ago, according to Rachel Johnson Greer, a former compliance employee who left the company in 2015. At the time, she said, Amazon was developing automated tools to ensure products sold on the site complied with state and local regulations. Greer said the company decided against including ads in the tool’s development because doing so would have delayed the launch by a year, and managers were eager to make sure it was following applicable laws. She expressed surprise that Amazon hadn’t addressed the advertising situation long ago since so many states have their own regulations regarding toys, jewelry, children's apparel and bedding to protect consumers from toxic materials.\n\n“I’m confident this kind of thing happens very often,” said Greer, who now provides consulting services to online merchants. “This is just a terrible customer experience.”\n\nIn February, Robinson described the situation in a seller support forum on Amazon’s website, seeking reimbursement for misplaced ads and sounding an alarm for other merchants. An Amazon representative named “Susan,” who responded on the forum, was unsympathetic: “I understand the reason the ad is allowed to run is because many customers have multiple shipping addresses on their account, often in different states.” Robinson received a similar response from an Amazon advertising representative.\n\nRobinson said the $15,000 refund offered by Amazon is of little consolation because the incident cost him between $200,000 and $300,000. He suspects the misplaced advertisements harmed his “conversion rate,” a key metric Amazon’s algorithm uses to determine a product’s popularity and how prominently it appears in search results. He said his sales dip coincided with the advertising problem.\n\nFor now, Robinson said he’s in survival mode and trying to migrate his sales off Amazon as quickly as possible. He’s investing in Google search advertisements that direct shoppers to his own website.\n\n“The real problem with Amazon is there’s no escalation path when things go wrong,” he said. “You have to go to the media and embarrass them.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?

        "title": "11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 oversold NASDAQ stocks to buy right now. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nNASDAQ Leads The Market\n\nOn March 12, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up by 1.5%, spearheaded by the technology stocks that have been leading the tech-heavy index ever higher for a long time now. While being heavily focused on the tech sector, the NASDAQ is also known for its exposure to other sectors, such as the consumer discretionary, healthcare, and financial sectors, all of which contribute to the index's success. As a result of these market leaders, the NASDAQ has steadily become an attractive marketplace for budding and seasoned investors alike.\n\nMany investors today are thinking about current market dynamics in terms of the future outlook for the upcoming months and what that may mean for investors. On March 12, Gabriela Santos, chief market strategist at JPMorgan, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss her thoughts on the current outlook and market. Here's what she had to say:\n\n\"We do sound positive, first on the fundamentals. For the economy, we see growth normalizing this year 2%, but zero recession in our base case. We see inflation also moderating towards 2% by the end of the year, so you still have a pretty resilient nominal growth backdrop for companies, so resilient revenue growth. At the same time, it seem to us that the big takeaway from fourth-quarter earnings was a bottoming in the margin contraction from last year.\"\n\nThe highlights above show that a positive trend for stocks should continue as we move forward into 2024, which should be encouraging for investors looking to buy into the market. Considering the upside gains in the NASDAQ being seen so far, this index may be a good place to start for those looking to buy. This is especially the case considering the fact that the index compromises of some of the most influential and profitable names in the market right now, most notably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nDiversifying Outside of Tech in 2024\n\nFor investors, one thing to note at present is that big tech isn't the only area to keep an eye on when it comes to the Nasdaq Composite Index. Santos, on CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" highlights the fact that several other names within the tech sector and outside of it are now also beginning to rake in the gains. Here's what she said:\n\n\"It's actually a healthy sign. For example, within mega-cap tech, the 'Magnificent Seven' that dominated so much of returns last year, there was dispersion within the group but they were all up. This year, you're seeing quite substantial dispersion within the group. Some are up double digits, some are performing in line with the market, and some are down double digits. That's very healthy to see, thinking of the actual companies as individuals. You're also seeing other parts of the tech sector participate, and other sectors. Things like healthcare, which we had talked a lot about last year as being one of our favorite sectors, contributing as well. So I think it's a very healthy appreciation, that it's not just AI, it's not just about the initial beneficiaries of that theme, it's also about resilient earnings.\"\n\nIn light of the above, we believe that while tech is definitely an area to keep track of this year, investors should not just put all their eggs in the tech basket. As such, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks listed on the NASDAQ to buy right now. Our list compromises both oversold stocks in the tech sector and in other sectors, such as healthcare, to give a more holistic set of options to investors looking to buy right now. You'll thus find that we have quite a few options below to choose from, ranging from cheap healthcare stocks to buy to oversold tech stocks to buy. 11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA trader in a financial institution using fundamentals analysis to select stocks for a portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to pick oversold stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index for our list. The RSI indicator is a momentum indicator used in the technical analysis of stocks by measuring the speed and magnitude of a security’s recent price changes to evaluate whether the price of that security is overvalued or undervalued. Stocks with RSI values of over 70 are traditionally considered overbought, while those with RSI values under 30 are oversold. We thus used a stock screener to find oversold stocks listed on the NASDAQ with RSI values under 30 and then ranked them based on this metric, from the highest to the lowest RSI value. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, using Insider Monkey’s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nOversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n11. Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

It has become a smaller position through price declines and sales of shares as uncertainty increased on both the potential for new initiatives as well as their timing.\n\nI often reflect on what went wrong. How did this go from a growth stock to a value stock? There have been two causes, in my opinion. The first is that their product delivering content (not apps) on phones lost T-Mobile as a customer – sometimes we are one day closer to a bad outcome: the loss of a customer. The second, and bigger issue was with their SingleTap product. SingleTap is a technology that “enables smartphone users to instantly install an app to their Android device with a single tap…bypassing the noise of the app store environment, and dramatically increasing conversions.” The higher conversion rates mean lower costs per app install or app opening…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.

        "title": "Microsoft to launch generative AI security software as competition continues to grow",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) took another step in its race to add generative AI capabilities to its array of enterprise products on Wednesday, announcing the availability of its Microsoft Copilot for Security platform.\n\nThe service, which hits the market April 1, is meant to help cybersecurity professionals better understand security threats and cut down on the time it takes to discover security issues. The platform has been in public preview since November 2023.\n\n“Copilot is informed by large-scale data and threat intelligence, including more than 78 trillion security signals processed by Microsoft each day, and coupled with large language models to deliver tailored insights and guide next steps,” Vasu Jakkal, Microsoft corporate vice president of security, said in a statement.\n\nCopilot for Security is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, as well as Microsoft’s own AI models, and integrates into Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR.\n\nMicrosoft’s Sentinel is a platform that allows cybersecurity professionals to detect and hunt for threats, while Microsoft Defender helps them protect against, and address, attacks. Microsoft Security Copilot provides a means for cybersecurity workers to ask questions about threats and attacks and get responses based on whether and where potential attacks can or have hit an enterprise’s systems. Microsoft and its OEM partners are adding a new Copilot button to Windows laptop and desktop keyboards as the AI PC generation kicks off. (Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nIn addition to making Copilot for Security available for general purchase, Microsoft said it is adding new features to the platform including the ability for users to create their own generative AI prompts for their businesses and add third-party software integrations, as well as support for prompts and responses in eight languages.\n\nTo bolster its pitch for Copilot for Security, Microsoft is also releasing a new study that it says shows cybersecurity professionals not only benefit from Copilot, but want to continue using it.\n\nThe study, which Microsoft says focused on experienced security professionals, found that workers were 22% faster with Copilot and 7% more accurate across all tasks while using the software. Microsoft says 97% of those surveyed said they want to use Copilot the next time they do the same task.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilots, generative AI-powered apps, are currently available in preview or for general access across a slew of Microsoft’s software segments including finance, customer relationship management, cloud computing, productivity, Windows 11, and more.\n\nThe general idea is for Microsoft to integrate Copilots, or at least generative AI, into each of its products as it seeks to squeeze the most out of its multiyear, multibillion-dollar investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nMicrosoft got off to an early lead in the generative AI wars thanks to its work with OpenAI, but the competition is catching up. In February, Alphabet’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its Gemini Business, a $20-per-month add-on for its Gemini for Workspace productivity suite. The company also offers Gemini Enterprise, a $30-per-month add-on for Gemini for Workspace with enhanced features for meeting summaries and transcriptions.\n\nAnd last week, Salesforce (CRM) announced two new healthcare programs running on its AI-powered Einstein 1 Platform.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is also offering its own generative AI capabilities, setting up yet another front in the cloud wars between the two tech behemoths.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its healthcare offerings on the back of growing generative AI capabilities, which are presently acting as key growth catalysts for the company. Its shares have surged 47.4% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 47.2%.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google launched Vertex AI Search for Healthcare, a generative AI powered tool intended for the healthcare industry.\r\n\r\nThe tool utilizes generative AI to assist clinicians in searching for information from patient notes, scanned documents and other clinical data.

        "title": "5 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks to Buy on Ongoing Wall Street Rally",
        "content": "Wall Street has had a great year so far. Stocks have rallied on renewed optimism that the economy is likely to have a softer landing after the Federal Reserve hinted at multiple rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThis saw all three major indexes hitting record highs this year. The Dow and S&P 500 hit all-time highs in early February. Nasdaq was a bit slow in catching up, but on Mar 1, the tech-heavy index hit a new high of 16,274.94 points.\n\nTech stocks particularly performed well last year after a disappointing 2022, helping the broader market, and the rally has continued into this year. The Nasdaq gained 43.4% in 2023, recording one of its best years since 2020. The index has risen 6.7% year to date and is poised to gain in the near term.\n\nThis year’s rally is being particularly fueled by the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, led by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nExperts believe AI has tremendous potential, which is yet to be witnessed by the world. NVIDIA’s stupendous success over the past year has motivated a large number of tech companies to explore the potential of AI in a bid to secure more business opportunities in the long term.\n\nAlso, the progression of various smart devices is playing a significant role in this field, as they demand computing and learning capabilities for tasks such as face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nThese operations require features such as high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions. These specific requirements are creating favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\n\nBesides, the Federal Reserve has indicated multiple rate cuts this year after ending its monetary tightening campaigns. Market participants are expecting at least five 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nLower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs, which bode well for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM, which have strong potential for 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 79.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.1% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAmazon.com  is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program, well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13% over the past 60 days. AMZN currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. MSFT dominates the PC software market, with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems. The Microsoft 365 application suite is one of the most popular productivity software globally. MSFT is also one of the prominent public cloud providers that can deliver a wide variety of infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service solutions at scale.\n\nMicrosoft has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.4% over the past 60 days. MSFT presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNetflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 41.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 6.5% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nQUALCOMM designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecom products and services based on the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. QCOM’s products include CDMA-based integrated circuits (ICs) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, as well as global positioning system (GPS) products. QUALCOMMalso offers development and other product-related services to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nQUALCOMM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.5%.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Microsoft",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 13, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT\n\nThe Magnificent 3: Unveiling the Top Tech Titans\n\nFor over a decade, the Magnificent Seven - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - have dominated the tech scene. But with recent market fluctuations, investors wonder: are they still golden tickets?\n\nWhile I have little doubt that each of these companies will continue to be market leaders in the foreseeable future, three of them have superior near-term outlooks.\n\nIn this article, I will share why I favor these three components of the elite group and what can change in the others to elevate them to Strong Buy status.\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia's stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren't looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by the other companies that have been grouped in for the past year before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Laird Superfood, Inc. (AMEX:LSF) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript March 12, 2024\n\nLaird Superfood, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.02, expectations were $-0.21. Laird Superfood, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Good afternoon. Thank you for attending the Laird Superfood, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Call. My name is Matt, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call for opportunity questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Steven Richie, General Counsel of Laird. Steve, please go ahead.\n\nSteven Richie: Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Laird Superfood's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. On today's call are Jason Vieth, Laird Superfood President and Chief Executive Officer; and Anya Hamill, our Chief Financial Officer. By now, everyone should have access to the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release filed after today's market close. It is available on the Investor Relations section of Laird Superfood website at www.lairdsuperfood.com. Before we begin, please note that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the context of federal securities laws. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements.\n\nPlease refer to today's press release and other filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason Vieth: Thanks, Steven. Good afternoon, and thank you to everyone who has joined us today. Now that you have all seen our Q4 2023 results, I hope that you will agree that it is not an overstatement to say that Laird Superfood had a tremendous quarter. During Q4, we hit our team's goal of a financial trifecta, positive sales growth, positive profitability and positive cash flow, the latter two of which were a first time ever for our company while trading as a public entity. These results represent just the latest step in what has been a rather steady path of improvement since I first spoke with all of you two years ago. And I'm proud to say that these improvements have allowed us to remove the going concern disclosure from our financials.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is a significant vote of confidence in our financial position and outlook and further motivation for our team to ensure that we operate the business as professionally and confidently as possible. I'll start with what might be our most noteworthy accomplishment in a quarter full of them. During Q4 2023, we were able to return our DTC business to plus 10% growth versus the same quarter in 2022. This was accomplished despite a decrease in our marketing spend by 54% during the same comparative period, which obviously means that our marketing effectiveness metrics surged once again during Q4. This represents our first quarter of growth in this channel since almost two years ago after the changes to iOS upended the DTC industry and was accomplished to more effective targeting and messaging and by highlighting our most solid products and creating better offerings for bundles and cross-selling.\n\nOne key to this accomplishment was the increase of our revenue from subscriptions to 46% of our total DTC net sales base, which I would assert demonstrates that consumers are recognizing the benefits from consistently attending to their health through their nutrition, and that our coffee, creamers, greens and the adaptogenic mushroom products are a perfect fit for consumers to create what we at Laird Superfood have referred to as the healthy daily ritual. In addition to converting more of our customers to subscribers, we were also successful in Q4 in increasing our net sales from new DTC customers by 76% year-over-year, driven by our partnership with the Shawn Ryan Show and other well-executed top-of-funnel marketing activities. I am also pleased to report that our average DTC order reached more than $57 in Q4.\n\nGiven these metrics, it should not be surprising that our brand affinity remains extremely strong with our consumers. With our Net Promoter Score still hovering in the mid-70s and our customer satisfaction score at 4.9 on a 5-point scale. A large portion of our e-commerce business is also conducted on Amazon. And here, I am happy to report that we have continued to make steady progress in returning this business to growth after the challenges created by the quality event that we encountered approximately a year ago. Out of that event, it took approximately six months to fully withdraw and replenish our coffee creamers on the Amazon platform. During which time, we saw a significant reduction in sales. But in Q4, with our stock inventory levels restored to normal, we were able to execute our marketing plan on this platform and restore our path to growth.\n\nDuring Q4, our net sales through Amazon reached $1.76 million, a 38% increase over Q3 of '23, despite a 22% pullback in direct media spend on Amazon during that time. This is a testament to the cohorts that we have established on this platform which was further aided by 26% increase in revenue from subscriptions, which now represents nearly 1/4 of Laird Superfood net sales on Amazon. Given the lapping of those 2023 challenges during the first half of this year, we expect to see strong Laird Superfood through Amazon throughout 2024. Turning to our wholesale business. I am pleased to add that we continue to make steady progress in expanding our distribution in this important strategic channel. To date, our wholesale business has been largely concentrated in the natural channel, where we have continued to make great strides to build out our brand among consumers that are motivated by health.\n\nDuring 2023, our clubs of distribution in natural finished the year up 24% versus the end of 2022, driven by wins in large national retailers as well as across smaller independents that are vital to consumers in this channel. Specific to Q4, I am pleased to announce that we were successful in securing national distribution with Whole Foods for our shelf stabilizers, which will complement the full national distribution that we had recently attained on our core item liquid creamer portfolio. Those items began shipping a few weeks ago and bring us to eight items in distribution within Whole Foods across the country. I'm equally pleased to share that we have also had continued success at Sprouts Farmers Market! who has been a great partner to our brand and where we now have 22 items in distribution, representing one of our most complete build-outs of any retailer in the country.\n\nI am also pleased to share that during Q4, we became the number one brand within the coffee category of sprouts, charging ahead of the likes Beats, Full Approved, Meltdown, Death Wish all the other brands in this category. We believe that this is just the start of the exciting things to come as we continue to build our brand strength and share our health and wellness portfolio with consumers across the country. As we look forward from here, we will execute an expansion strategy to an additional categories in the natural channel and begin to put emphasis on growing our distribution and conventional channel, where we currently have very little distribution in a very large market. Along with the success that we are having commercially, it comes with a recognition that we couldn't achieve any of this if we didn't have a supply chain that was a flexible, responsive and adaptive as we do. A chef in a professional kitchen demonstrating ways to use the company's products to cook healthy and functional food.\n\nLast year, our supply chain was able to shut down our own facility in Oregon, identify co-packing distribution partners and move our entire business over the span of just around two months. Our supply chain team operated nearly flawlessly through a quality event in the first half of last year, quickly replenishing our raw material inventory and keeping most of our key suppliers supplied throughout that challenging stretch. And now with our powder products fully transitioned to an asset-light supply chain model and with our liquid creamer transition behind us, we were able to achieve over a 40% gross margin during Q4. Our supply chain is flexible and agile and is built to support our future growth. Going forward, we continue to expect our gross margin to remain in the high 30s.\n\nOur focus on cost management extends beyond the supply chain for our operational expense as well. During Q4, we reduced our total year-over-year adjusted OpEx of $6.1 million to $3.7 million representing a decrease of 38% in Q4 of 2023. This was accomplished by a broad-based reduction in our OpEx spend, which we will continue to manage tightly as we go forward. And finally, I want to share a few thoughts on our cash position, which increased in Q4 2023 by $280,000. Based on our working capital needs and planned investments, we do not anticipate generating positive cash flow in every quarter. However, we do believe that with our planned growth rate in 2024 and beyond, we may soon be generating cash to support our operations. I also want to reiterate that we were able to remove the going concern disclosure from fires.\n\nWe are proud of this recent change and believe that with our forecasting growth profile and gross margin outlook, the Laird Superfood is now in position to carry an improved financial profile in the future years. And now, let me turn the call over to Anya to discuss the fourth quarter results in more detail.\n\nAnya Hamill: Thank you, Jason. Net sales were $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 2.6% as compared to $9.2 million the prior year period and flat to the third quarter of 2023. As Jason discussed, both the e-commerce and wholesale channels delivered growth in the fourth quarter. E-commerce contributed 66% of total net sales and increased 2% year-over-year, led by DTC growth of plus 10%. These improvements were in part offset by a year-over-year decline in Amazon sales of 12%, a substantial and narrower decline than in the previous quarters and driven by a 59% Amazon media spend reduction as we resolve to improve profitability on this platform. Wholesale contributed 34% of total net sales and increased 5% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth in club and distribution expansion in the natural channel as well as product velocity improvement behind updated packaging, which launched in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nGross margin in the fourth quarter rose to 40.4%, which is a 45-point improvement on a year-over-year basis due to charges related to Sister's access activities in the fourth quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, gross margin improved 21 points year-over-year and 10 points sequentially versus Q3 of 2023, driven by continued benefits of transitioning to third-party co-manufacturing and distribution. Q4 gross margin of 40% is a milestone that supports our expectation that we can deliver margins in the upper 30s in the coming quarters. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $3.7 million, a decrease of $11.6 million compared to $15.3 million in the prior year period. This reduction was driven by lab and expenses related to our exit from Sisters in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nExcluding onetime charges, operating expenses were reduced $2.4 million, primarily due to lower marketing costs, resulting on strategic cuts of inefficient spend and lower people costs and other general and administrative expenses following the restructuring activities in 2022. I am pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, for the first time in the Company's history, we achieved positive net income and positive cash flow. Net income as reported was $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement of $15.7 million versus the prior year period. Net cash add in the quarter was $0.3 million compared to cash burn of $3.2 million in both the third quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022. These results were driven by margin expansion and significant reductions in general and administrative costs, demonstrating the strong progress that we have made in managing costs and pushing the business towards profitability in future quarters, although we do not expect this to occur in a perfectly linear manner.\n\nWe ended Q4 2023 with $7.7 million of cash and no debt as we continue to conservatively manage our balance sheet. We now project that we will have enough cash to fund our operations into 2026. And our annual report on Form 10-K will not contain the going concern language that was included in our prior quarterly report. Further, after many had conversations with several vendors regarding our ability to put in place an asset-backed loan, we are optimistic that such a vehicle is available to us, should we decide that we would prefer additional funding to support our operations or growth. The changes we have made to our business model have significantly improved the underlying economics and strengthened our competitive position. As we go forward, we will continue to focus on maximizing our most profitable commercial growth opportunities while maintaining strict emphasis on continued cost to drive the business towards profitability and maintain our cash position to support our future operations and other opportunities that may emerge.\n\nOur full year 2024 guidance is as follows. Net sales are expected to be in the range of approximately $38 million to $40 million, representing growth of 10% to 15% compared to 2023. Gross margin is expected to expand to approximately 37% to 40%, excluding any onetime extraordinary charges, representing a 7- to 10-point improvement versus 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jason.\n\nJason Vieth: Thanks, Anya. I know that I seem to say it every quarter, but I want to reiterate that I believe that the future of our Laird Superfood business has never looked brighter. This time around, please indulge me while I share my thesis for that condition. First, our Net Promoter Score and customer satisfaction scores are indicative of our incredible brand strength and the trust based on our brand by Laird Superfood consumers and should be the envy of any virtually any major food company today. Second, our product portfolio is well positioned for the health and wellness trends that continue to grow in importance both within the U.S. and internationally, as demonstrated by our Q4 volume and sales growth. Importantly, our gross margin is now in line with many of the premier companies in our industry and can provide us with strong cash generation as we continue to grow our business.\n\nAnd finally, I would wager that our organization is as still, competent, motivated and engaged as any similarly sized company in the industry. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions.\n\nSee also 27 Most Charitable Countries in the World and 8 Most Educated Religions in the World.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in March",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence(AI) stocks have had a great run in 2023 and the early part of 2024. But after such a run, which AI stocks are worth adding in March?\n\nOne good place to look is the stocks of tech leaders that haven't yet exceeded their 2021 highs, but will still likely benefit from the AI revolution. As such, these three big tech stocks look like great buys for this month and beyond.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is nearly back to its 2021 highs, but it's still 6% below those levels set three years ago.\n\nWhy is Amazon lagging some of its Magnificent Seven peers? The market appears a bit worried Amazon's competitor Microsoft may have a leg up on Amazon in the AI race, thanks to Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, or that AI in general may be somewhat disruptive to some of Amazon's businesses.\n\nBut it's really just the first inning in the AI races, and it's far from clear that OpenAI's LLMs will win out and dominate the marketplace -- especially with OpenAI's internal turmoil that was recently publicized.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has a number of structural advantages in both its cloud and e-commerce and advertising businesses that should help make generative AI a profit-enhancer, not a detractor.\n\nFirst, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is still the largest cloud provider out there, and it's somewhat disruptive for organizations to just up and move all their data to another cloud. So, Amazon has the advantage of time and deep customer relationships to develop its own compelling AI offerings.\n\nOf course, Amazon has been doing this in spades already, not only by developing its own large language models (LLMs) under the Titan brand name, but also hosting the broadest number of third-party LLMs for AWS clients under the AWS Bedrock platform. Additionally, Amazon offers highly cost-effective AI for applications that can run on Amazon's in-house developed chips Trainium and Inferentia.\n\nAnd Amazon's non-cloud businesses, from e-commerce to advertising to physical stores and satellite broadband, are all likely to benefit from generative AI. While AI may help smaller competitors catch up to leaders in certain industries, Amazon's giant physical e-commerce distribution infrastructure is unlikely to be disrupted by an AI software algorithm. That leaves Amazon's massive and data-rich e-commerce businesses likely to be greatly enhanced by GenAI from both a revenue generation and cost perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have recently seen AWS' revenue growth stabilize since the broader tech downturn began in 2022, and have also seen profitability inflect upwards in Amazon's e-commerce businesses. Expect those trends to continue, and for Amazon to eventually make new all-time highs.\n\nMicron\n\nThe memory industry is just starting to come out of one of its worst-ever slumps, yet Micron(NASDAQ: MU) is approaching its all-time highs from early 2022 once again.\n\nThat may seem like a contradiction, but the memory industry is very cyclical, with booms leading to busts and visa-versa. Thus, Micron is likely to experience a massive profit surge as the industry comes out of this downturn, and perhaps catapulting to new heights on the back AI demand.\n\nAs one of only three producers of leading-edge DRAM memory worldwide, Micron and its peers all cut back heavily on production last year, and repurposed their equipment to make leading edge DDR5 and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which are currently in extremely high demand to feed AI applications.\n\nThe control of supply along with recovering demand, led by the super-strong demand for AI memory, is leading to a massive recovery in DRAM pricing and volumes. Research firm Trendforce noted a near-30% quarter-over-quarter rise in DRAM industry revenue in the fourth quarter 2023, and has projected a 20% price increase for DRAM chips in the first quarter alone. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nKeep in mind, these are quarterly figures, which annualize to some truly eye-opening growth numbers. Meanwhile, imbuing every electronic device with AI capabilities, from data center servers to edge computing devices to PCs should lead to double-digit increases in DRAM content per device over this period, also according to Trendforce.\n\nMicron was a bit behind competitors in getting its HBM product to market, but just announced volume manufacturing of its HBM3E product on February 26. The new HBM3E performance boasts industry-leading performance and power efficiency, and will be a key part of the upcoming Nvidia H200 systems that will begin shipping in the second quarter.\n\nWith an AI boom just beginning and a newly disciplined memory industry on the supply side, investors should expect a strong up-cycle and better profitability going forward, which should lead Micron to new highs.\n\nTencent\n\nChinese stocks are a no-go for many investors right now. But while the geopolitical concerns are quite valid, even the best-in-class Chinese companies now trade at dirt cheap valuations.\n\nThat goes for Tencent(OTC: TCEHY), which currently trades at a ridiculous 12.8 times earnings. And the main business is even cheaper; Tencent had listed and unlisted holdings in investee companies that totaled $112 billion as of the third quarter, amounting to about one-third of Tencent's total market capitalization. So investors can essentially buy Tencent's main businesses for just 8.5 times earnings today!\n\nWhile the Chinese economy is no doubt in the dumps, Tencent still grew revenue 10% last quarter, and is a dominant leader in mobile gaming, social media, fintech, and business cloud applications. Moreover, it is becoming an AI leader, launching its first LLM, named Hunyuan, back in September.\n\nTencent's bargain valuation and cash-generating capabilities give it a very low bar to clear for the stock to be successful. For those comfortable investing in China or wanting some Chinese exposure, Tencent seems the best house on that block.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Lilly Partners With Amazon to Sell More Weight-Loss Drugs",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Eli Lilly & Co. is teaming up with Amazon.com Inc. to expand its nascent business of selling weight-loss drugs directly to patients.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEx-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary United Tells Boeing to Stop Making Its Long Delayed Max 10s Stock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets Wrap Physical Intelligence Is Building a Brain for Robots China Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US Wheat\n\nSurging demand for these medications has made getting them a hassle at times. In response, the pharma giant started LillyDirect this year to make it easier. Patients connect with doctors online and certain drugs can be delivered through digital pharmacies such as Truepill and now Amazon Pharmacy.\n\nAmazon might be able to help speed up turnaround times for getting a prescription, said Frank Cunningham, Lilly’s group vice president of global value and access. “We’re looking to create a more convenient experience through our partners.”\n\nRead More: Eli Lilly to Sell Hit Weight-Loss Drugs Directly to Public\n\nSo far, selling direct has been “surprisingly successful,” Chief Executive Officer Dave Ricks said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg’s Caroline Hyde at the Economic Club of New York.\n\n“Do people use it? Yes, at scale,” Ricks said. “In fact, we’re having trouble keeping up.”\n\nLilly hasn’t disclosed detailed figures on its direct business, and declined to provide specifics for this story.\n\nAs demand for GLP-1 drugs has exploded, more patients are turning to telemedicine services to pair them with doctors who can prescribe medications. While some programs have real expertise and individualized services, others offer little beyond the scripts they dole out.\n\nLilly has suggested its platform could also help patients reduce their medical costs by ensuring that coupons and savings programs are applied. And unlike other pharmacies, Lilly can tell patients when medications are expected to be in stock, Ricks said. That might be a key selling point because there have been ongoing supply shortages of Lilly’s Mounjaro and Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We can communicate: ‘OK, we don’t have it today, but in two weeks time your shipment will arrive,’” Ricks said in the interview. “CVS and Walmart can’t do that.”\n\nIt’s unclear just how many patients Amazon Pharmacy serves or how the partnership may help extend Lilly’s reach. The e-commerce company said last year that its active customers had doubled, without providing a number.\n\nBut Amazon has had some success clinching contracts with insurers, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, which made Amazon Pharmacy its default home delivery option. It struck a similar deal with Blue Shield of California last year.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom Luxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls Make Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "3 Dow Stocks to Sell in March Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is meant to serve as a proxy for the U.S. economy. The index is comprised of 30 blue-chip stocks that represent different sectors and industries. Known as the “Dow 30,” the index recently made a big change when it removed the stock of retail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and added the stock of e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The addition of Amazon has been largely viewed as a positive for the Dow. Walgreens had been a long-term underperformer that had dragged down the index.\n\nWhile many people were happy to see Walgreens removed, the truth is that there are many stocks in the Dow 30 that have proven to be long-term disappointments. This helps to explain why the Dow’s performance has trailed that of the other major U.S. indices, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500.\n\nHere are three Dow stocks to sell in March before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing Co. (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nAnyone still holding onto shares of aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) may want to sell before things get worse. BA stock has been in free-fall following a January incident that saw a door-sized hole blow open on a Boeing made aircraft mid-flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been investigating the matter, and now word comes that the U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe.\n\nJustice Department officials have reportedly interviewed pilots and attendants that were onboard the flight when the hole opened in the fuselage midair, and investigators have told some passengers that they could be the victims of a crime. Where this goes from here is not clear, but it is more bad news that is dragging down BA stock. Year-to-date, the company’s share price has declined 24%, bringing its five-year decline to 50%.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nStocks of most microchip and semiconductor companies are surging this year. Not Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company’s share price is down 7% since the start of 2024, bringing its five-year decline to 18%. INTC stock continues to slump as the company lowers its outlook for the year ahead and delays construction on a new $20 billion microchip and semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel has said that the delay in constructing the Ohio chip plant is due to “weak market conditions.” This at a time when demand for microchips and semiconductors has never been higher, fueled by a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Intel had expected to have the Ohio plant operational in 2025. Construction has now been pushed back to late 2026.\n\nAt the same time, Intel has lowered its forward guidance for this year, saying it is struggling with a slowdown in demand for its microchips, particularly in the personal computer (PC) segment. All these issues make Intel a Dow stock to sell in March.\n\nNike (NKE)\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nSneaker and athletic wear giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) is another chronic under-performer when it comes to Dow stocks. Year-to-date, NKE stock is down 5%. Over the last 12 months, the company’s share price has declined 13%. Through five years, the stock is up 16%, compared to an 81% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. Reasons for the poor performance include a slowdown in China and bloated inventory levels, among others.\n\nMost recently, Nike announced plans to cut 2% of its global workforce, or more than 1,500 jobs, to lower expenses amid what it too has cited as weak demand. Nike claims that retailers are lowering their orders for its sneakers and athletic apparel through wholesale channels, and that it continues to be negatively impacted by an economic slowdown in China, its second largest sales market. Nike had 83,700 employees last summer.\n\nThe company next reports its quarterly earnings on March 21. Nike had better show some improvement in terms of its turnaround strategy or the stock could really crash and burn.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Top Growth Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Left and Right",
        "content": "If you're curious about what the world's most successful investors are buying and selling, you're not alone. The good news is that learning from the pros is probably easier than you think.\n\nTo find out what billionaires are buying and selling, we just need to look. Every three months, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires all money managers who control $100 million or more to disclose their trading activity to the public. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEveryday investors can learn a lot by following billionaire money managers, but it's important to remember that not every every bet they make pays off. Here's a closer look at two stocks that were popular with billionaires in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAmazon\n\nShares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) surged about 81% last year. Billionaire money managers buying the stock hand over fist were partly responsible for the gain. Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors added a little over 4.3 million shares in the fourth quarter, and James Simons of Renaissance Technologies opened a new position by acquiring nearly 4.3 million shares.\n\nAmazon's stock has surged this year because e-commerce profits came roaring back in 2023. Operating income from its North American segment swung to a very healthy $14.9 billion last year from a loss of $2.8 billion in 2022.\n\nAmazon dominates the U.S. e-commerce market, but there's still plenty of room to grow. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported total retail sales that reached $1.83 trillion in the fourth quarter. E-commerce sales grew more than twice as fast as overall retail, but it's still only 15.6% of the total.\n\nE-commerce isn't the only large addressable market that Amazon is quickly growing into. Its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services, increased sales 13% last year to $90.8 billion. Worldwide spending on cloud services is expected to grow 20.4% this year to reach $679 billion, according to Gartner.\n\nDuolingo\n\nThe second top growth stock billionaire investors bought up in the fourth quarter was language learning specialist Duolingo(NASDAQ: DUOL). Israel Englander of Millennium Management increased its position more than fivefold by acquiring 178,357 shares in the fourth quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Advisors and Two Sigma Investments added a combined 277,983 shares to already large positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuolingo's smartphone application of the same name is gaining popularity at a hair-raising pace. There were 26.9 million daily active users on the platform in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was 65% more than it reported a year earlier.\n\nMany of Duolingo's free users upgrade to paid subscriptions and conversions are accelerating thanks to relatively new pricing in international markets. There were 6.6 million paid subscribers at the end of 2023, which was 57% more than it had a year earlier.\n\nSavvy growth stock investors are highly encouraged by Duolingo's ability to attract new members sustainably with a social-first marketing process. Viral videos starring its big green owl cost next to nothing to produce, but they regularly rack up millions of views. Sales and marketing expenses rose just 13%, while its gross profit soared 44% last year.\n\nDuolingo stock is richly valued at about 64 times 2024 earnings expectations. That means investors who buy at recent prices could suffer heavy losses if the company's bottom line doesn't rise rapidly for a few more years. For some investors, this is a risk worth taking, but it might be best to wait for a more attractive price from this volatile growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "10 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa",
        "content": "In this article, we will list the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence industry, go to 5 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected physical objects, devices, machines, and other products that are embedded with sensors, software, and communication technologies. These devices can collect, and more importantly, exchange data with each other and central systems over the internet. They gather information to make decisions and interact with the physical world and digital systems.\n\nThe IoT market is one of the fastest-growing ones globally. Growth is propelled by an increased demand for automation and an increasing need for big data for data management. Research and cloud computing platforms are also driving the growth of IoT. In addition, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also pushing the market's growth. Its market size, which was $328.6 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $2,703 billion by 2032. The global IoT market will experience a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.46% during this forecast period. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at 33%.\n\nThe IoT market is segmented by components, deployment, organization size, platform, technology, and industry verticals. The software segment has the largest share when segmented according to component. The cloud segment leads in the deployment segmentation, whereas the enterprise segment has the largest share when segmented according to organization size. In addition, the network communication segment has the largest market share when segmented according to technology.\n\nIoT devices often rely on ML and AI to carry out their tasks. Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Echo devices are an example of IoT devices that use AI to enhance their capabilities. These devices are smart speakers that come with Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa. Recently, Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) has made many AI-related enhancements to Alexa to give it a more opinionated personality. These enhancements also give it the ability to adjust tone and response to express emotions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently, generative AI like ChatGPT has gained the attention of tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), among others. The AI market is currently in the stage of maturation and has significant opportunities for real-world application. It has a positive long-term growth outlook, and these tech giants are looking to cash in on this opportunity.\n\nThe global AI market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19% during the forecast period of 2022-2023. It was valued at $454 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $2,575 billion by 2032. Currently, the North American region has the largest market share at more than 36%. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to expand the highest during this forecast period with a CAGR of 20.3%.\n\nThe AI market can be segmented according to technology, solution, and end user. Technology-wise, deep learning has the largest share. The services segment takes the lead when segmented according to the solution. When segmented according to end users, banking, financial services & insurance (BSFI) takes the lead.\n\nAI's flexibility and adaptability are driving its growth. Some of the areas where it is being increasingly used are life-saving medical devices and self-driving features in electric cars. This growth is also propelled by an increasing investment from top tech giants such as Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) for the upgradation and development of various applications of AI. One of the supplier-side factors driving the growth of AI is the vendor and end-user industries' partnership to enhance reach. An example of such a partnership is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Intelligent Network's collaboration with LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, India to incorporate machine learning and bring data-driven eye care services to India.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also causing disruption left and right. A startup founded by an ex-Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa scientist is looking to disrupt the investment industry through AI. Theia Insights recently raised $6.5 million. The company claims that it can distill vast amounts of financial information through AI and other tech so investors can make better decisions.\n\nMachine learning and deep learning-based healthcare detection systems are also emerging trends in the industry. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s machine learning technology advances the early detection of diabetic eye disease using deep learning. IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s diabetic eye disease detection technology is found to be 86% accurate in classifying the severity of the disease across the five levels recognized on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Scale.\n\nOne of the ongoing trends in AI is experimentation in advertising. AI giants such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Co-pilot, open AI's Chat GPT, and Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Gemini are experimenting with ads so they could solve the monetization issue of generative AI. Most people are not willing to spend $20 every month for premium generative AI models such as GPT-4. So, ads could soon take over chatbots, which would provide these companies with a more viable revenue model. This is already been done by Adzedek which introduces itself as an AI chatbot advertising market palace. The company lets brands run sponsored ads in its custom chatbots, the revenue of which is shared between Adzedek and the chatbot creator.\n\nThere is severe competition within the AI industry which also comes from new entrants. A Palo Alto-based startup by the name of Inflection AI has developed a generative chatbot that is considered as powerful as the GPT-4 model, especially across STEM subjects. This Inflection AI model is currently powering Pi, Inflection AI's voice assistant. Many people consider Pi to be ChatGPT that can take commands in the form of voice inputs.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa.  10 Best Alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa\n\nPhoto by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo curate our list of the 10 best alternatives to Amazon Echo and Alexa, we used five (1,2,3,4,5) sources. In our methodology, we referred to frequency as the number of times the speaker appeared in our sources. We gave the utmost importance to frequency, but we also wanted to account for the ranking of speakers in our sources. So, we devised the following calculation, which we call the ranking factor: 10/ (sum of rankings*100). Our final Insider Monkey score was calculated by adding the frequency and the ranking factor. The higher this score, the higher the speaker ranks on our list.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

The centers, set up over the next five years, will also focus on bringing down manufacturing costs and finding new ingredients, according to Andy Jarvis, director of Future of Food at the Bezos Earth Fund.\n\n“Alternative proteins are an imperative if we are to stay within planetary boundaries, if we are to feed 10 billion people within those boundaries,” Jarvis said in a video interview. “We’re investing in alternative proteins because they need to be successful.”\n\nThe funding is part of a $1 billion commitment by the Bezos Earth Fund to tackle food’s impact on climate and nature. Alternative proteins have been singled out as a way to help shift diets away from livestock, a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions. But they have struggled to win over consumers due to a lack of flavor, high prices and concerns over nutrition.\n\n“They need to cost less, they need to be more flavorful,” Jarvis said.\n\nThe Bezos Earth Fund was launched in early 2020 by Bezos — the world’s second-richest person and founder of Amazon.com Inc. — who pledged $10 billion to fight climate change and protect the natural world.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom Luxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls How Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Brian Bolan is the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research and he has two more stocks for your aggressive growth radar screen. This week he is taking a look at a couple of “A” stocks. Not only do these stocks start with the letter “A” but they both have a Zacks Style Scores for growth that are “A” as well.\n\nBrian explains in the video that just about all of his aggressive growth Zacks Rank Buy videos the stocks will have a growth style score of ”A”. He also looks for stocks that have a weaker value style score. The thinking here is that value investors and growth investors are inherently looking for different things.\n\nAmazon AMZN is first up on the list and Brian takes a look at the most recent beat the company posted as well as the earnings estimate revisions over the last 60 days. He then speaks to the rate of growth that the company is seeing noting that growth remains consistent for 2024 and 2025. Given the fact that the revenue numbers come from such a high base the consistency of growth is impressive.\n\nFinally Brian takes a look at the valuation metrics that most investors peak at and then looks at the chart to see if there can be any information gleaned from the trading history.\n\nNext up is Angi ANGI Which is a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy) just like Amazon AMZN. Brian notes that if interest rates start to move lower people that are trapped in their homes and want to purchase larger homes are likely to start to fix up their homes and complete small projects. Hiring contractors can be very difficult and this company is focused on reviews to help customers find the right company.\n\nAs he did with Amazon AMZN Brian takes a look at the earnings history, earnings estimate revisions, sales growth and other valuation metrics before taking a look at the chart.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Finding the next multi-bagger investment isn’t as easy as staking all your cash on a Fabulous Four stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or playing it safe by index investing. Instead, the key to long-term, massive gains is finding speculative stocks with potential that the market is overlooking.\n\nIn a nutshell, you’re like an investor buying into Nvidia in 2013 when shares traded in penny stock territory: you have a vision of the future and have found a speculative stock that fits that vision. More importantly, you have the conviction to wait out turbulence with massive gains on the horizon.\n\nWhile these stocks may not be the next Nvidia, each is cornering an important and emerging market with massive potential. As early movers in their respective spaces, these speculative stocks remain under the radar — for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBraze (BRZE) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nManaging marketing in today’s digital creator economy is tough when you consider the many platforms, customer expectations across channels, and sheer scope of a well-integrated marketing campaign. Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) is a speculative stock that helps customers better manage marketing efforts. Shockingly, most investors don’t have this mid-cap speculative stock on their radar even though it boasts mega-clients like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), NASCAR and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).\n\nIn a nutshell, Braze leverages user data to better personalize advertising across platforms. It creates a coherent thread for the potential customer while helping the advertiser track spending and return on ad sales more efficiently. Braze is also one of the few companies effectively using customer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) integration tools. That’s in contrast to companies slapping an “AI” label on anything and everything with a hint of automation, whether or not the label is appropriate.\n\nA newer company expanding as rapidly as possible, Braze isn’t yet turning a profit. But the company’s strong revenue growth, high subscription revenue rate (95%) and a notable client book prove this speculative stock has a bright future. Even if it remains under the radar for now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe “Internet of Things” is a well-known trope by now, but for many the phrase conjures up thoughts of connected refrigerators and home alarm systems. While valid, those are just a slice of the overall IoT sector. However, speculative stock Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is scaling the concept to serve enterprise and industrial operations more effectively. Samsara primarily targets fleet, transportation and heavy equipment to manage operational workflows, track movement and improve overall safety.\n\nSamsara just marked a record-setting year in its most recent report, nailing 39% year-over-year (YoY) recurring revenue growth. Recurring customer counts climbed 49% and brought in a respectable $27 million in free cash flow. Most importantly, Samsara is a relatively new firm bringing an equally nascent tech to market. It means the firm’s upward possibilities are endless as they increase market penetration and begin scaling to meet growing clients by targeting the bigger fish currently just out of their reach.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) ecommerce company nogin, NOGN stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer e-commerce is as popular as ever post-pandemic, with giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) leading the way. GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) operates similarly but carves out its niche by focusing on the vast B2B market. It aims to be the ultimate platform for businesses to source products and handle all related vendor, product and sourcing management tasks.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud provides a comprehensive suite of services tailored for the scaled B2B e-commerce market, including a vibrant vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and notably, secure cross-border payment facilitation.\n\nThe company’s price-to-earnings ratio stands out for its low value, at just 19x, starkly contrasting with the tech sector’s average ratio of 36x. This disparity becomes even more pronounced when considering GigaCloud’s earnings growth, which saw earnings per share double over the past four quarters. Moreover, the company maintains robust free cash flow per share and trades at an exceptionally low 0.68x sales, highlighting its status as a highly undervalued speculative stock in today’s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in BRZE.

        "content": "The FTSE 100 in the City of London hit its highest level since May - REUTERS/Hollie Adams\n\nThe FTSE 100 jumped to its highest level since May as investors cheered the prospect of earlier interest rate cuts.\n\nBritain’s blue-chip index rose 1pc on Tuesday to close just shy of 7,750 points after jobs market data showed a fall in vacancies and a slowdown in wage growth.\n\nThe latest data is likely to embolden Bank of England policymakers as they debate when to bring interest rates down from their 16-year high of 5.25pc.\n\nThe prospect of lower borrowing costs encouraged investors to pile into UK stocks with gambling company Entain, insurer group Beazley and JD Sports, among the biggest risers.\n\nPrudential also edged over 3pc, with fellow Asia-focused financial services giant HSBC not far behind, following a strong performance by Chinese stocks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVictoria Scholar at Interactive Investor said: “Wage growth, although weakening slightly, remains relatively robust which may not be enough for the Bank of England,” she said.\n\n“The central bank has made it clear it wants to see significant evidence that pay growth is slowing before cutting interest rates. Nonetheless it still looks like a summer rate cut is on the cards.”\n\nMarkets expect the Bank of England to cut rates in June, followed by a series of further cuts to bring its base rate to as low as 4.25pc in a year’s time.\n\nOfficials, led by Andrew Bailey, the Governor, are particularly worried about wages because they want services price growth to fall further before they can feel confident rampant inflation has been fully defeated.\n\nInflation has fallen from a peak of 11.1pc in October 2022 to 4pc in January. But much of this has been driven by energy costs and internationally traded products, with goods price inflation down to 1.8pc.\n\nBy contrast, prices in services, which offer a better track of inflation in the domestic UK economy, are still up by 6.8pc on the year.\n\nAs a result, a slowdown in pay growth raises hopes the Bank may be able to act sooner rather than later.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, official US data showed inflation was higher than expected in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrices rose by 0.4pc between January and February and are up by 3.2pc on the year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBoth of those figures were a touch higher than January’s inflation numbers.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out food and energy, fell from 3.9pc to 3.8pc, but that is above the 3.7pc which economists had predicted.\n\nAs a result, Greg Wilensky at Janus Henderson Investors said the chance of a quick rate cut from the Federal Reserve is fading.\n\n“This report means that a May rate cut has likely been removed from the Fed’s menu,” he said.\n\n“I still see June as the most likely month for the first cut, but this could shift to July if the inflation data does not start to improve next month.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:09 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Daniel Woolfson reports:\n\nEntain, which runs the BetMGM betting brand in the US with MGM Resorts, has appointed Ronald J Kramer as an independent non-executive director.\n\nMr Kramer formerly ran Wynn Resorts, a high-end hotel and casino operator and property developer based in Las Vegas. He is currently the chief of the Griffon Corporation, a New York-headquartered manufacturing conglomerate.\n\nHe will be paid an annual fee of £95,000 for the posting at Entain.\n\nIt comes as gambling companies have been ramping up their focus on the US since a supreme court decision in 2018 allowed states to set their own laws, sparking a boom in betting across the country.\n\nBarry Gibson, the chairman of Entain, said: “[Mr Kramer] is a high-calibre individual with deep knowledge and expertise of the US gaming industry.”\n\n05:28 PM GMT\n\nFTSE 100 jumped to its highest level since May\n\nThe FTSE 100 jumped to its highest level since May as investors cheered the prospect of earlier interest rate cuts.

The progress here being the slight dip in the annual core rate.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve has indicated it expects to cut interest rates this year, but first has to see the inflation rate slow convincingly towards its 2 percent target.\n\n05:00 PM GMT\n\nAfrican Development Bank warns over loans given by China\n\nThe head of the African Development Bank is calling for an end to loans given in exchange for the continent’s rich supplies of oil or critical minerals used in smartphones and electric car batteries, deals that have helped China gain control over mineral mining in places like Congo and have left some African countries in financial crisis.\n\nAkinwumi Adesina told the Associated Press:\n\nThey are just bad, first and foremost, because you can’t price the assets properly. If you have minerals or oil under the ground, how do you come up with a price for a long-term contract? It’s a challenge.\n\nLinking future revenue from natural resource exports to loan paydowns is often touted as a way for recipients to get financing for infrastructure projects and for lenders to reduce the risk of not getting their money back.\n\nThe shift to renewable energy and electric vehicles has caused a spike in the demand for critical minerals, driving these kind of loans.\n\nThat includes a China-Congo deal that strengthens Beijing’s position in the global supply chain for electric vehicles and other products as it taps into the world’s largest reserves of cobalt, a mineral used to make lithium-ion batteries, in the impoverished central African country.\n\nMr Adesina, whose Ivory Coast-based institution helps finance development in African countries, said these arrangements come with a litany of problems.\n\nHe highlighted the uneven nature of the negotiations, with lenders typically holding the upper hand and dictating terms to cash-strapped African nations. This power imbalance, he said, coupled with a lack of transparency and the potential for corruption, creates fertile ground for exploitation.\n\n04:53 PM GMT\n\nFootsie closes up\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 1.03pc today. The biggest riser was Ladbrokes owner Entain, up 3.76pc, followed by insurer Beazley, up 3.64pc.

The biggest faller was PZ Cussons, down 6.32pc, followed by Royal Mail owner International Distributions Services, down 5.69pc.\n\n04:44 PM GMT\n\nAI will trigger surge in cyber attacks, warns Lloyd’s\n\nAI will increase the “frequency, severity, and diversity” of cyber attacks over the next two years, Lloyd’s of London has warned. Michael Bow has the details:\n\nResearchers at the insurance market said a new breed of “zero-safety” generative AI will trigger a proliferation of cyber losses for small businesses as criminals weaponise these systems.\n\nNew AI systems such as Meta’s Llama2 are different to models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT because the internal safety mechanisms can be stripped out, opening the door for criminal gangs to access powerful tools that can be used to defraud businesses, Lloyd’s said.\n\nAlthough each cyber loss is likely to be smaller, there will be many more of them, affecting more businesses.\n\n“It is likely that the frequency, severity, and diversity of smaller scale cyber losses will grow over the next 12 to 24 months, followed by a plateauing as security and defensive technologies catch up to counterbalance,” Lloyd’s said.\n\nMany of the emerging cyber risks posed by generative AI will eventually be underwritten in the Lloyd’s market, meaning researchers are keen to stay ahead of the problems.\n\nLloyd’s said zero-safety AI had already been used to create detailed explanations on how to conduct money laundering activities using locations on the dark web.\n\nIt is also being used to impersonate humans well enough to convince remote workers to bypass internal security control.\n\nDeepfakes pose “significant challenges” as they could impersonate executives, increasing extortion and liability risks, the report added.\n\nIn a recent case in Hong Kong, a worker transferred cash to criminals after being convinced he was speaking to the chief financial officer of the business over Zoom.\n\n04:40 PM GMT\n\nEngineering group Costain generates higher profits\n\nProfits at London-listed engineering group Costain jumped 29.2pc to £44.2m in 2023, according to results released today. The rise came despite a 6.3pc fall in revenue to £1.3bn.\n\nAlex Vaughan, chief executive, said that it had an “excellent pipeline of opportunities and are driving high levels of tendering activity”. He added that the company was in a “positive position to take advantage of the medium and long-term growth opportunities in UK infrastructure”.\n\nThe company said that it was on track to meet its targets for margins this year and next. Shares were up around 1.2pc in trading this afternoon.\n\n04:22 PM GMT\n\nUS stock market ready for a correction, warns top Wall Street investor\n\nA leading Wall Street investor has warned that the US stock market is ready for a correction after its rally fuelled by the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks.\n\nJohn Rogers, founder of Ariel Investments, told Bloomberg:\n\nWe’ve gone a long time without any kind of significant pullback from either the markets or the economy. It just feels as if we’re vulnerable for there to be a significant correction.\n\nBloomberg reported that while the Magnificent Seven drove most of the S&P 500’s gains last year, Mr Rogers said that smaller company stocks began to rise in the fourth quarter. He suggested that small and mid-cap shares offer an opportunity that investors should want to buy.\n\n04:04 PM GMT\n\nBritish and Indian PMs want ‘ambitious’ outcome to trade talks\n\nRishi Sunak told his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi that he wanted an “ambitious” outcome to trade talks between the countries, as they agreed on the need for a comprehensive deal in a call on Tuesday.\n\nMr Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters:\n\nThey agreed on the importance of securing a historic and comprehensive deal that benefits both countries.\n\nThe Prime Minister [Mr Sunak] reiterated the importance of reaching an ambitious outcome on goods and services, and they agreed to remain in close contact and look forward to further progress on trade talks.\n\n04:01 PM GMT\n\nVeterinary group plunges after news of regulator investigation\n\nShares in Aim-listed vet group CVS are down nearly 25pc in trading today after the Competition and Markets Authority launched a formal market investigation into the veterinary market. The regulator said that an initial study raised “multiple concerns” about the functioning of the market.\n\nCVS told investors that it “has engaged constructively and proactively with the CMA throughout its review ... and [has] put forward a package of possible remedies to address its concerns. CVS continues to believe this package could be adopted across the market and could address the CMA’s concerns more quickly than an 18-month investigation.”\n\nPet supplies retailer Pets at Home, which also offers veterinary care, is down 3.2pc.\n\nPets at Home said:\n\nWe are incredibly disappointed the CMA’s findings today do not fully reflect our unique business model of locally-owned vet practices.

That was partly the result of some methodology changes by the government.\n\nStephen Juneau, an economist at Bank of America Securities in New York, said:\n\nThere is a high likelihood that OER inflation will exceed rent inflation more often moving forward.\n\nHowever, we think that much of the 20 basis points divergence was noise and not signal.

There is a certain amount of information on that that HMRC have, not only from their own UK sources but also from agreements they have with other jurisdictions around sharing information. But it is clearly an area of uncertainty.\n\nThen there is a judgment on the extent to which those individuals may decide to leave the UK as a result of the higher tax burden that they face. We have made an assumption of around 10pc to 20pc of those individuals leaving the country. That is based on both external analysis of the impact of tax on location, which actually tends to find a surprisingly small relation between those two things.\n\nAnd there is also evidence from the last time this regime was reformed in 2017 that it looks like migration was relatively low. But this is a different reform that kicks in earlier.\n\nThe final uncertainty is around the degree to which those people will undertake tax planning to eventually reduce their liabilities. Again, looking at 2017, it seems that the evidence is that took place less than what was expected. We have an assumption of about 30pc lower yield as a result of that.\n\n11:40 AM GMT\n\nMental health ‘tends to be’ why young people off work, says head of spending watchdog\n\nYounger people tend to be off work as a result of mental health issues, the head of the UK’s spending watchdog has said, as he said economic inactivity did not appear to be as a result of rising NHS waiting lists.\n\nOBR chairman Richard Hughes told the Treasury Select Committee:\n\nPeople out of the workforce for health reasons is now the single largest reason to be outside the workforce if you are an adult as well as the fastest growing.\n\nWhen we looked at it and compared it to people on the waiting list we didn’t find that much overlap, actually. Their reasons for being outside the labour force didn’t seem to be principally because they were also the people on the NHS waiting list.\n\nIt seemed to have multiple different causes depending on people’s age. For older people it was often because people had musculoskeletal conditions. For younger people it tended to be more mental health issues.\n\nWe think there are more complex reasons for why people are not in the labour force than just the waiting list.\n\n11:24 AM GMT\n\nWorklessness now a feature of post-lockdown Britain, says OBR chief\n\nWorklessness has become a “worrying trend” in the economy since the pandemic, the head of the UK’s spending watchdog has told MPs.\n\nOffice for Budget Responsibility chairman Richard Hughes said economic inactivity -where people are neither in work nor seeking a job - was becoming a “feature” of Britain’s economy after the Covid years.\n\nIt comes after figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a total of 9.25 million people of working age are now classed as economically inactive, up from 8.55 million in February 2020.\n\nAlmost three million of these are under-25s, a rise of 384,000 over the past four years.\n\nMr Hughes told the Treasury Select Committee that the economy had been growing as a result of net migration but now the economy was suffering from a reversal in its workforce amid “rising levels of inactivity and a falling participation rate”.\n\nHe said:\n\nThat is a worrying trend which we had hoped was turning around last forecast and heading back towards pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBut in more recent data, including in today’s data from the ONS’s labour market report, it looks as though persistently high levels of inactivity seem to be a feature of the post-pandemic environment and one which is worrying from the point of view of human welfare.\n\n10:52 AM GMT\n\n‘We don’t know’ how the Government will make spending plans add up, says OBR boss\n\nThe Chancellor’s Budget has created a “significant risk” of overspending on public services, the head of the UK’s spending watchdog has warned MPs.\n\nRichard Hughes said the Office for Budget Responsibility had received little detail on what will happen with spending on public services after March next year.\n\nSpeaking at the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Hughes said:\n\nThere continues to be an imbalance between how much detail we have of the government’s tax plans which support its objective of getting debt falling in five years’ time and the amount of detail that we have about its plans for departmental spending which makes up 40pc of total public spending on the spending side of the ledger.\n\nWe know the Government’s plans for National Insurance, we know the Government’s plans for energy taxation in five years’ time but what we know about the Government’s plans for spending on public services runs out after March of next year and then after that the Government just gives us two numbers to put into our forecasts: one for total current spending on public services and one for total capital spending on public services and no detail about what that means for the National Health Service, what that means for education or what it means for transport.\n\nThat poses a significant risk because those envelopes are relatively constrained. They are not growing in real per-capita terms and so what we don’t see on the spending side is a plan for living within that relatively constrained envelope while also meeting what the Government has also stated, which is objectives to grow certain large elements of public service spending faster than that overall envelope.\n\nThey have got a workforce plan in the NHS, they have a commitment to grow defence spending in line with GDP, they have got commitments to grow oversees aid spending in line with GDP. They have got ambitions in some of those areas to go even further. How they make that add up with the rest of Whitehall departments, we don’t know.\n\n10:38 AM GMT\n\nBudget ‘only just’ meeting Chancellor’s fiscal targets, says OBR chief\n\nThe chair of the Government’s official forecaster said the Chancellor’s budget last week “only just” met fiscal rules and still faces “significant risks”.\n\nRichard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said:\n\nThe budget was responsible in terms of the objectives the Chancellor has set for himself - in five years to get debt to begin to fall in share of GDP (gross domestic product).\n\nHowever, it does that with one of the narrowest margins any Chancellor has had against his fiscal targets.\n\nIt’s the second narrowest of £9 billion and the very narrowest was this time last year.\n\nIt’s meeting those fiscal targets but only just.\n\nThere are significant risks to the fiscal outlook weighing on that margins, not least the ones that are very likely to crystalise, such as fuel duty being frozen rather than indexed.\n\n10:33 AM GMT\n\nStandard Chartered overhauls board amid ‘crap’ share price\n\nA frontrunner to replace the chief executive of Standard Chartered will depart the business as part of a boardroom overhaul days after its boss said its share price is “crap”.\n\nSimon Cooper, who led its corporate, commercial and institutional banking dvisioin for eight years, will leave the lender to “pursue other interests”.\n\nRoberto Hoornweg and Sunil Kaushal will instead lead a renamed corporate and investment banking unit.\n\nIt comes weeks after chief executive Bill Winters criticised the bank’s share price despite unveiling rising profits and a new $1bn share buyback.\n\nStandard Chartered shares have risen 2.2pc today.\n\n10:15 AM GMT\n\nMortgage arrears hit highest level in seven years\n\nThe proportion of UK mortgages in arrears has risen to its highest level since 2016 in a sign that high interest rates are impacting the economy.\n\nFigures from the Bank of England show the value of outstanding mortgage balances with arrears increased by 9.2pc to £20.3bn in the final three months of 2023, compared to the previous quarter.\n\nIt was 50.3pc higher than a year earlier as borrowers grappled with interest rates at 5.25pc - their highest level in 16 years.\n\nThe proportion of the total loan balances with arrears, relative to all outstanding mortgage balances, increased on the quarter from 1.12pc to 1.23pc, which was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\n09:52 AM GMT\n\nUS recession ‘not off the table’ warns Wall Street bank boss\n\nWall Street grandee Jamie Dimon said he does not think a US recession is “off the table” ahead of crucial inflation figures out later.\n\nThe chief executive of JP Morgan, who has led the bank since 2006, said he was more pessimistic than market traders about the outlook for the US economy.\n\nMarkets are waiting to see the latest US inflation figures at 12.30pm UK time, which could impact the Fed’s timing of its first cuts to interest rates, which are at their highest level since 2001.\n\nHe told the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney via videolink:\n\nThe world is pricing in a soft landing, at probably 70-80pc.\n\nI think the chance of a soft landing in the next year or two is half that. The worst case would be stagflation.\n\nMr Dimon said economic indicators have been distorted by Covid-19 and he takes them with “a grain of salt,” saying the Fed should wait for more clarity before lowering interest rates. The comments were first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nHe added: “They can always cut quickly and dramatically. Their credibility is a bit at stake here.

He added:\n\nWhat’s more, the further fall in the number of job vacancies from 928,000 in the three months to January to a 32-month low of 908,000 in the three months to February suggests the labour market continues to loosen more than the unemployment rate is letting on.\n\nThat’s consistent with wage growth slowing to 4pc to 5pc and February’s REC survey points to wage growth of 3pc in six to nine months’ time.\n\nAnd as long as the average 0.3pc month-on-month rise in earnings in the past six months continues, actual wage growth will fall more markedly in the coming months.\n\nThat, alongside a fall in CPI inflation below the 2pc target in April, could be enough to prompt a rate cut in the summer.\n\n07:49 AM GMT\n\nPay figures ‘set the stage for first rate cut in summer’\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said wage growth is slowing much more quickly than the headline figure suggests and inflation will soon be back below 2pc.\n\nHe said this will “set the stage for a first rate cut in the summer and for interest rates to end the year at 4.5pc”, adding:\n\nAdmittedly, there are still concerns about the quality of the employment data. Indeed, the ONS has not yet re-endorsed the new data as official statistics and warns users to take care when using them.\n\nBut there is plenty of evidence that the labour market is easing. The number of people in employment dropped by 21,000 on the quarter to January and the number of payrolled employees rose by just 20,000 in February.\n\nMore important for the inflation outlook are the pay figures. Private sector wage growth excluding bonuses, the measure most reflective of underlying pay pressures, slowed from 6.2pc to 6.1pc.\n\nAnd the quarter-on-quarter annualised measure, which is a better indicator of current pay pressures, was a little over 3pc, about half the headline rate.\n\nOverall, even though pay growth is still double the 3pc to 3.5pc that the Monetary Policy Committee thinks is consistent with 2pc inflation, there are clear signs that monetary policy will soon need to become more accommodative.\n\nPay growth is slowing and inflation is falling more quickly than expected so it probably won’t be long before rate cuts are on the table even if the unemployment rate remains stubbornly low.\n\n07:37 AM GMT\n\nYoung people behind surge in economic inactivity, says ONS\n\nThe rise in economic inactivity over the past year - that’s people neither in work nor looking for a job - was driven by an increase in young people, writes Szu Ping Chan.\n\nLiz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:\n\nAn important trend that we are seeing there is young people.\n\nIf we look over the last year we’ve seen that increases in inactivity have been concentrated in the younger age groups, particularly in that 16-24 year-old age group. We’ve seen that increase by 248,000 over a year.\n\nWe’ve also seen employment going down for young people. While the number of people of people has gone up overall, that isn’t true for the 16-24 age group.\n\nShe added there had also been “an important increase in the year in long term sick” which has grown by 85,000.\n\nShe added: “Recently we’ve been seeing historically high levels of people who are inactive because they are long term sick which of course is a concern.”\n\nMs McKeown said it was not possible to say if young people were driving the rise in inactivity because of sickness.\n\nMany tend to be inactive because they are in higher education like university, although increasing numbers are suffering from mental health issues. A breakdown economic inactivity by reason and age will be released next month.\n\n07:31 AM GMT\n\nHunt: Our plan is working\n\nAfter the latest ONS data showing real pay increased, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:\n\nOur plan is working. Even with inflation falling, real wages have risen for the seventh month in a row.\n\nAnd take home pay is set for another boost thanks to our cuts to National Insurance which in total are putting over £900 a year back into the average earner’s pocket.\n\n07:31 AM GMT\n\nJob vacancies continue to fall and real earning increase, says ONS\n\nONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said:\n\nRecent trends in the jobs market are continuing with earnings, in cash terms, growing more slowly than recent data but, thanks to lower inflation, real terms pay continues to increase.\n\nThe number of job vacancies has also been falling for coming up to two years, though the total remains more than 100,000 above its pre-pandemic level.\n\nOver the last year, there was little change in the proportions of people who are employed, unemployed or neither working nor looking for work, though the overall number of people in work is still rising.\n\n07:26 AM GMT\n\nWage growth slows amid hopes of interest rate cut\n\nWage growth is slowing down, official data show, in an encouraging sign for the Bank of England as it seeks to cut interest rates.\n\nAnnual growth in regular pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 6.1pc in the three months to January, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe figure was behind December’s pace of 6.2pc and below analyst predictions that the rate of wage growth would remain unchanged.\n\nHowever, real pay, which takes inflation into account, increased for the seventh straight month to 2pc.\n\nPolicymakers at the Bank of England have said they want to see signs that wage growth is easing before they will feel comfortable that cutting interest rates will not trigger an uptick in inflation.\n\nIn a further boost to hopes for interest rate cuts, the rate of UK unemployment rose to 3.9pc in the three months to January from 3.8pc in the previous three months, signalling that the economy is slowing.\n\nIt came as economic inactivity fell slightly to 21.8pc of the workforce as the number of people out of work owing to long-term sickness fell slightly.\n\nWe've published the latest UK labour market figures.\r\n\r\nHeadline indicators for the UK labour market for November 2023 to January 2024 show:\r\n\r\n&squf;️ employment was 75.0%\r\n&squf;️ unemployment was 3.9%\r\n&squf;️ economic inactivity was 21.8%\r\n\r\n➡️ https://t.co/F9TC4bkR4dpic.twitter.com/xcLxAH4C03\n\n— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) March 12, 2024\n\n07:16 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me. Wages have grown at a slower pace than anticipated in a boost for hopes of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.\n\nRegular pay excluding bonuses grew at 6.1pc in the three months to January, according to the ONS, easing back from 6.2pc in the period to December.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Four million at risk of abandoning work permanently as benefits surge | Post-pandemic shift in welfare discourages unemployed from looking for jobs, think tank warns\n\n2) Britain risks losing out to Germany in £16bn net zero scheme | Developer behind Moroccan solar and wind farms ‘looking at options’\n\n3) Wealth managers face the music after years of rip-off fees | The sector faces a remarkable fall from grace as the City watchdog launches a crackdown\n\n4) Vogue publishing moguls to make up to $1.4bn from Reddit float | Closely watched listing will be one of the biggest of the year so far\n\n5) Ben Marlow: Car finance scandal shows rotten banks incapable of change | PPI-scale mis-selling adds to misdeeds clocked up since the financial crisis\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nShares were mixed in Asia ahead of a report on inflation in the US that could sway the Federal Reserve’s timing on cutting interest rates.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 closed down 0.1pc, or 22.98 points, to 38,797.51, retreating further from its recent record highs as expectations build that the central bank will raise its negative benchmark interest rate next month.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 Most Advanced Countries in International Trade. You can also take a look at the 5 Most Advanced Countries in International Trade.\n\nThe international trade industry stands as the foundation of the global economy, facilitating the exchange of goods, services, and capital across borders. With advancements in technology and globalization, the landscape of international trade has undergone profound transformations.\n\nInternational Trade: Key Trends\n\nThe global international trade industry has experienced consistent growth, with the total value of world merchandise trade reaching $19.48 trillion in 2020, as reported by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Emerging markets and developing economies have been driving significant trade growth. According to the WTO, the share of developing economies in global merchandise trade increased from 39% in 2000 to 47% in 2019. Regional trade agreements have played a pivotal role in fostering trade growth. For example, intra-EU trade accounted for 67% of the EU's total trade in goods in 2020, highlighting the importance of regional integration in boosting trade volumes.\n\nThe Port of Shanghai, the world's busiest container port, handled over 43 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of cargo in 2020, highlighting the importance of major ports in facilitating global trade flows. Moreover, investments in infrastructure projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) have led to significant improvements in trade connectivity between Asia, Europe, and Africa. As of 2020, China has invested over $210 billion in BRI-related projects and trade facilitation reforms have yielded tangible results. For example, countries implementing the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) have experienced a 4.7% reduction in trade costs on average.\n\nAdditionally, regional trade agreements have proliferated in recent years, with over 300 regional trade agreements in force worldwide. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), launched in January 2021, aims to create the world's largest single market, covering 1.3 billion people with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion. Despite the challenges facing multilateral trade negotiations, the WTO remains central to the global trading system, with 164 member countries accounting for 98% of world trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only that, but sustainable trade practices are also gaining prominence. For example, the market for sustainable packaging is projected to reach $393.93 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8% from 2021 to 2028. Inclusive trade policies are critical for small & mid-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs account for over 90% of businesses worldwide and contribute up to 60% of total employment and these have led to women's participation in trade is essential for inclusive growth. Closing the gender gap in trade could add up to $28 trillion to global GDP by 2025.\n\nSome companies have been prominent in adding to their respective country’s trade balances. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the world's largest online retailer, has transformed the way consumers shop and businesses sell goods globally. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s cross-border trade services facilitate international sales for small and medium-sized businesses, helping them expand their reach and access new markets. In 2020, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s net sales reached $386.1 billion, with a significant portion attributed to international sales. Although the exact percentage of international sales contributing to total revenue is not specified, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s global presence and extensive cross-border e-commerce operations undoubtedly contribute to the country's trade balance.\n\nSimilarly, C. H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW), a third-party logistics (3PL) company, offers freight transportation, logistics, and supply chain services globally. The company's expertise in freight forwarding, customs brokerage, and supply chain optimization helps businesses navigate the complexities of international trade and streamline their logistics operations.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Top Dogs\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that although I favor three of these stocks, each of the Magnificent 7 are still exceptional companies and stocks. However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple, Alphabet and Tesla\n\nThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.\n\nApple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.\n\nThis seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.\n\nAs AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.\n\nAlphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.\n\nAdditionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.\n\nAlphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.\n\nOr course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.\n\nWhile major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.\n\nUntil this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT) stock isn't having a great 2024. Since Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) confirmed in January that it will walk away from its deal to buy the Roomba maker, iRobot stock has fallen 40%.\n\nIt didn't help that the company released its first financial report post-breakup on Feb. 26 showing sales down 14% and a $2.28 per-share loss in Q4. And now, things are getting worse. iRobot just gave investors guidance for Q1 2024, and its stock is down another 4.2% through 11 a.m. ET.\n\niRobot Q1 2024 earnings guidance\n\niRobot says Q1 sales will range from $137 million to $142 million, as much as a 14% decline year over year. Losses will be lighter than in Q4, but even so, iRobot will lose at least $2 per share (adjusted for one-time items) and perhaps as much as $2.13.\n\nAll of these numbers are worse than what Wall Street was expecting. According to TheFly.com, Wall Street still thinks iRobot will hold sales more or less steady at $158 million and lose less than $2 a share.\n\nThe good news is that the losses described so far are all non-GAAP. When calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), iRobot's Q4 loss should range from no more than $0.09 to $0.22 per share.\n\nIs iRobot stock a sell?\n\nThe other good news is that Q1 may be as bad as things get. While the company's forecast for the rest of 2024 isn't exactly optimistic, it's at least less horrible. Gross margins should improve as the year progresses, and sales declines won't be as dramatic. iRobot forecasts full-year sales between $825 million and $865 million -- only a 3% decline in the best-case scenario.\n\nEarnings will still be atrocious, however. The GAAP forecast is for a loss of $2.70 to $3.13 per share, similar in scale to the non-GAAP forecast for losses of $3.30 to $3.73. Given this prospect, I have zero interest in owning iRobot stock this year -- and you probably shouldn't, either.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iRobot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iRobot, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iRobot wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +161.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.08 points to a change of +40.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.32 indicates a change of +30.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $142.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $641.36 billion and $715.6 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Investors Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, one of Wall Street's few constants is that there's always a next-big-thing trend or innovation garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, no trend is captivating the attention and pocketbooks of investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhen discussing \"AI,\" I'm talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally manage. However, the true value of AI is seen with the incorporation of machine learning, which allows AI software and systems to evolve over time so they can become more efficient at their tasks.\n\nLast year, researchers at PwC released a report (\"PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution\") that suggested AI would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. This would include a $6.6 trillion increase in productivity, as well as $9.1 trillion derived from consumption-side effects. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe sector- and industrywide appeal of AI isn't lost on Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers. Billionaire investors from many of the most-watched investment funds have been strategically moving their capital into and out of certain artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy is that billionaires have been active sellers of the face of the AI movement -- semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- while piling into two other AI stocks.\n\nBillionaire money managers are kicking Nvidia to the curb\n\nFollowing the end of every quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These 13Fs provide investors with detailed snapshots of what the top asset managers have been buying and selling. Based on the latest round of 13F filings, eight prominent billionaires put Nvidia on the chopping block, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millenium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nNvidia has become what I regularly refer to as the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are a staple of high-compute data centers. Demand has, thus far, handily outpaced supply of Nvidia's chips, leading to off-the-scale pricing power that's sent the company's data center sales through the roof.\n\nBut there's also no shortage of reasons to believe that the best for Nvidia has come and gone. In addition to growing external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia could contend with a significant amount of internal competition for AI chips from its own top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet, collectively account for around 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet all four companies are developing high-powered AI chips of their own.\n\nBillionaires might also be turned off by the regulatory headwinds Nvidia is dealing with. An initial round of export restrictions to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product, prompted Nvidia to develop the toned-down A800 and H800 chips. However, U.S. regulators ultimately restricted the export of these chips to China, as well. China is a key market for Nvidia, and these restrictions threaten to reduce its sales by billions of dollars every quarter.\n\nThe valuation doesn't make much sense, either. Nvidia is nearing the same levels that Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked at during the dot-com bubble, based on trailing-12-month sales. We've simply never seen a market-leading business trade at such a premium to its sales for an extended period of time. It shouldn't be that surprising that billionaires have been selling Nvidia stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Baidu\n\nThe first AI stock that had billionaire money managers completely forgetting about Nvidia during the December-ended quarter is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). Though not all billionaire investors will put their funds' money to work in China stocks, eight billionaires were buyers of Baidu (say that three times fast) during the fourth quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (290,154 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (147,481 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (135,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (80,815 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (47,000 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (38,966 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (5,545 shares)\n\nBaidu's utilization of AI can be seen in two of its fastest-growing segments: cloud and intelligent driving. The company's AI Cloud can allow merchants to use generative AI solutions to tailor ads to individual customers. Meanwhile, Apollo Go is the world's most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service, with accumulated rides on public roads surpassing 5 million since inception. AI-fueled ventures are helping Baidu's non-online marketing segment grow by a double-digit percentage more often than not.\n\nWhat billionaire investors might appreciate with Baidu, in relation to Nvidia, is that its foundational operating segment would likely prevent it from tumbling if the AI bubble bursts. Baidu's internet search segment has accounted for between 60% and 85% of China-based internet search share over the past nine years. Having the clearly dominant search engine in China should afford Baidu strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nBillionaires are likely also attracted to Baidu's minuscule valuation. Even factoring in the regulatory risks of investing in China-based companies, Baidu is valued at just 8 times forward-year earnings and less than 2 times trailing-12-month sales. It's a far cry from the mammoth valuation Wall Street has assigned to Nvidia, and presumably places a safe floor beneath Baidu's stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Amazon\n\nThe other AI stock that had billionaires forgetting about Nvidia is none other than \"Magnificent Seven\" component Amazon. During the December-ended quarter, eight successful billionaire investors piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nAmazon is incorporating AI solutions into its operations in more ways than can be counted here. Some of the more intriguing applications include leaning on generative AI solutions within its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help merchants personalize advertising to consumers, as well as relying on generative AI to improve the quality of product listings for merchants.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its market-leading e-commerce platform, online retail sales contribute very little in the way of operating cash flow or profits since it's a low-margin segment. The lion's share of the cash flow Amazon generates can be traced back to its ancillary operations: AWS, subscription services, and advertising services.\n\nAWS is the critical cog that's powering Amazon's cash flow higher. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of growth, which suggests AWS can sustain its leading share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Despite only accounting for a sixth of Amazon's net sales, AWS was responsible for two-thirds of Amazon's operating income last year.\n\nAmazon is also historically cheap, when compared to Nvidia. Shares are currently valued at less than 13 times consensus cash flow per share for 2025, which represents a 44% discount to Amazon's average multiple to cash flow over the prior five-year period.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Baidu wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "13 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics. You can also take a detailed look at the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics.\n\nThe logistics industry plays a critical role in facilitating global trade and commerce, encompassing the planning, implementation, and control of the movement and storage of goods and services. A comprehensive market analysis of the logistics industry worldwide involves examining key trends, drivers, challenges, and opportunities shaping the sector's landscape.\n\nLogistics Industry - Market Analysis\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, the global logistics market size stood at $7.98 trillion in 2022 and it is expected to be reach a value of $18.23 trillion by 2030 with a CAGR of 10.7% from 2023 to 2030. North America logistics market was valued at $1.9 trillion in 2022. Their report highlights that not only is Asia-Pacific the largest logistics market ($3.4 trillion in 2022), but its also the fastest-growing one (CAGR 11.9% over the forecast period).\n\nThe rise of e-commerce has revolutionized the logistics landscape, leading to a surge in demand for last-mile delivery services. In 2020 alone, global e-commerce sales amounted to approximately $4.28 trillion, representing a 27.6% increase compared to the previous year. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have played a pivotal role in driving this growth, with its Prime program offering fast and reliable delivery to millions of customers worldwide. To meet the rising demand for last-mile delivery, logistics companies are investing in innovative solutions such as electric delivery vans, drones, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nMoreover, technological innovations are transforming the logistics industry, enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience. Deutsche Post AG (XETRA:DHL.DE) leverages IoT sensors to monitor temperature-sensitive shipments in real-time, ensuring the integrity of pharmaceutical and perishable goods during transit. Similarly, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) uses AI-powered route optimization algorithms to minimize delivery times and fuel consumption. The global logistics automation market is expected to reach $95.9 billion by 2027, driven by increased adoption of automation solutions across warehouses, distribution centers, and transportation fleets.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlus, environmental sustainability has become a top priority for the logistics industry, with companies implementing green initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and minimize environmental impact. For example, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has adopted a \"Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize\" strategy to mitigate its environmental impact. This approach focuses on reducing emissions through fuel-efficient aircraft and vehicles, replacing traditional fuel with alternative fuels like biofuels and electricity, and revolutionizing the logistics industry through innovation and technology adoption. FedEx aims to achieve carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040.\n\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, prompting companies to reassess their supply chain strategies and invest in resilience measures. According to a survey by the Institute for Supply Management, 75% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic. To enhance supply chain resilience, companies are adopting technologies such as blockchain and AI to improve visibility and mitigate risks. For example, Deutsche Post AG (XETRA:DHL.DE) uses AI-based fraud detection algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent activities, such as identity theft, credit card fraud, and cargo theft, within the logistics supply chain. By analyzing transactional data, behavioral patterns, and anomalies, AI algorithms can detect suspicious activities and alert security personnel to take appropriate action promptly. This proactive approach helps mitigate the risk of financial losses, reputational damage, and security breaches in logistics operations.\n\nThe logistics industry operates within a complex regulatory environment influenced by trade agreements, customs regulations, and geopolitical factors. For example, the implementation of the European Union's Union Customs Code aims to modernize and streamline customs procedures, facilitating trade flows within the EU. Additionally, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) introduced new rules for trade between the three countries, impacting logistics operations and supply chain strategies.\n\nEmerging markets present lucrative opportunities for logistics companies seeking to expand their global footprint. According to the World Economic Forum, Africa's logistics market is projected to reach $19.9 billion by 2023, driven by rapid urbanization and infrastructure development. Companies like Deutsche Post AG (XETRA:DHL.DE) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) are investing in expanding their presence in these markets to capitalize on growing consumer demand. Moreover, the rise of digital platforms and on-demand logistics services presents new avenues for innovation and market disruption, offering opportunities for startups and established players alike to transform the industry landscape. 13 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics\n\nMethodology\n\nTo shortlist the 13 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics, we consulted credible sources like Conception Etude Realization Logistique and World Bank to learn about the Logistics Performance Index of different countries and to explore the 13 Most Advanced Countries in Logistics.

France\n\nLogistics Performance Index: 3.9\n\nFrance shows a strong logistical infrastructure supported by its central location in Europe, extensive transportation networks, and diverse economy. Its strategic position as a gateway to Europe, combined with its well-developed road, rail, and waterway networks, facilitates the smooth movement of goods domestically and internationally. Major ports like Marseille and Le Havre serve as key maritime hubs, while airports such as Charles de Gaulle International Airport handle significant air cargo traffic. France's efficient customs procedures and commitment to digitalization streamline cross-border trade, contributing to its role as a major player in global logistics. Moreover, France's focus on innovation, sustainability, and investment in green logistics initiatives ensures continuous improvement and competitiveness in the logistics sector.\n\n12. United Arab Emirates\n\nLogistics Performance Index: 4.0\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) emerges as a prominent logistics hub in the Middle East, leveraging its strategic location, modern infrastructure, and business-friendly environment. Situated among the major trade routes between Asia, Europe, and Africa, the UAE serves as a pivotal link in global supply chains. The country's world-class logistics infrastructure, including ports like Jebel Ali Port, one of the busiest in the world, and Dubai International Airport, a major air cargo hub, facilitates seamless trade and connectivity with international markets.

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Sold $8.5 Billion Worth Of Amazon Stock And Saved $600 Million In Taxes By Moving To Florida, But He's Holding Onto This Asset For The Long-Haul— And It's Something Anyone Can Buy",
        "content": "Jeff Bezos, the mastermind behind Amazon.com Inc., has been making headlines not just for his fluctuating position as one of the world’s richest people but also for his strategic financial maneuvers.\n\nIn a move that captured widespread attention, Bezos recently sold about 50 million shares of Amazon, capitalizing on the company’s significant growth since its inception. The sale, which reportedly netted Bezos around $8.5 billion, coincided with his relocation to Miami, a strategic decision that reportedly allowed him to save $600 million in taxes. This savvy financial play demonstrates Bezos’s adeptness at navigating the complexities of wealth management.\n\nWith a keen eye on the future, Bezos has been channeling a portion of his wealth into Blue Origin, his ambitious space exploration venture. The shift in focus from e-commerce to the cosmos reflects his vision for innovation and exploration, traits that have defined his career.\n\nAs an expert in money and success, Bezos understands the value of diversification. One asset that maintains a significant place in his portfolio is art. While it is often seen as a luxury or a passion investment, art is increasingly recognized for its financial merits, particularly as a hedge against inflation.\n\nTrending:\n\nWith returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. Oprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nTraditional investment vehicles are subject to the whims of market volatility and inflationary pressures, but fine art offers a tangible asset that appreciates over time and remains largely insulated from immediate market downturns. Bezos’s interest in art, underscored by his acquisition of notable works like Ed Ruscha's “Hurting the Word Radio #2” for $52.5 million and Kerry James Marshall's “Vignette 19” for $18.5 million, is a testament to the growing appreciation for art as a sophisticated investment strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rationale behind favoring art as an investment hinges on several key factors. First, art as a physical asset is not directly tied to the financial markets, meaning it doesn’t react to stock market fluctuations in the short term. This detachment provides a cushion against immediate economic shocks, offering a form of portfolio diversification that can mitigate risk.\n\nThe art market has historically shown a strong record of appreciation, with certain segments outperforming traditional investments over extended periods. This appreciation is driven by the unique, non-replicable nature of each piece, coupled with growing demand from a global base of collectors and investors.\n\nAdditionally, art possesses an intrinsic value that transcends its monetary worth. It embodies cultural significance, creative expression and historical importance, factors that contribute to its lasting appeal and enduring value. For investors like Bezos, art represents not just a financial asset but a legacy investment that can hold personal meaning while contributing to cultural preservation.\n\nInvestment platforms like Masterworks have democratized access to this once-exclusive market, allowing individuals to invest in shares of blue-chip art from some of the world’s most renowned artists. This approach has opened the door for more investors to incorporate art into their portfolios, leveraging its potential for capital appreciation and its role as a protective hedge against inflation.\n\nAs Bezos’s investment choices illustrate, art stands out as a strategic asset that offers not only financial returns but also enriches personal and cultural legacy. In the face of economic uncertainty, the allure of art as an investment is its combination of emotional satisfaction and financial resilience, making it an increasingly attractive option for those looking to diversify and protect their wealth over the long term.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Jeff Bezos Sold $8.5 Billion Worth Of Amazon Stock And Saved $600 Million In Taxes By Moving To Florida, But He's Holding Onto This Asset For The Long-Haul— And It's Something Anyone Can Buy originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paying countries for business analysts. We have also discussed the demand and importance of business analysts. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Business Analysts.\n\nWhy Are Business Analysts Important?\n\nBy 2025, IDC forecasts a high growth in worldwide data, projecting it to reach a mind-boggling 175 zettabytes, with a 61% increase from the current 33 zettabytes. This exponential increase confirms the monumental challenge of managing such colossal volumes, with data dispersed across three key domains: the core, edge, and endpoints.\n\nIDC's \"Data Age 2025\" report, sponsored by Seagate, highlights the transformative impact of this data explosion. Notably, the storage industry is set to ship 42 zettabytes of capacity within the next seven years, while IoT devices are projected to generate 90 zettabytes of data by 2025. With nearly half of this data expected to reside in public cloud environments and around 30% consumed in real-time, the landscape of data management and utilization is undergoing a seismic shift, demanding innovative solutions to navigate this data deluge.\n\nTherefore, in today’s day and age, business analysts are indispensable to modern enterprises as they navigate the ever-expanding sea of data. In 2024, when decision-making heavily relies on data-driven insights, business analysts serve as the linchpin. They translate complex datasets into actionable information, guiding strategic choices that shape the trajectory of organizations. Despite the abundance of data, the challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights efficiently. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be a crucial ally, empowering analysts to sift through vast datasets rapidly, identify patterns, and predict future trends.\n\nMoreover, AI democratizes data accessibility, enabling non-analytical stakeholders to comprehend insights effectively. By capitalizing on AI, analysts can focus more on strategic analysis rather than mundane tasks, thus maximizing their potential impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, in today's tumultuous retail landscape, the importance of analytics cannot be overstated. Facing challenges like labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and the threat of climate change, retailers are turning to data-driven insights for guidance. These analytics come in various forms, from descriptive and diagnostic to predictive and prescriptive, helping retailers understand consumer behavior, manage inventory efficiently, and empower their associates. For instance, by leveraging cloud-based analytics, retailers can optimize inventory placement across hundreds of stores, enhancing sales and customer satisfaction. Additionally, innovative approaches like using AI-powered robots to monitor inventory levels offer practical solutions to the supply-and-demand puzzle. Owing to the growing importance of business analysts, it is also one of the highest paying jobs for the future.\n\nTop Skills for Business Analysts to Learn in 2024\n\nIn the 2023, State of Social Media report, we discovered some interetesing findings: 80% of businesses expect a social media budget increase within three years, with 44% predicting a rise of over 50%. 90% emphasize the importance of capitalizing on social data for strategic decision-making. Moreover, 97% recognize the role of AI and ML in efficient data analysis. Leaders are gearing up to harness emerging technologies to maximize social media's impact. As social platforms evolve into indispensable business tools, adept utilization of data and AI has become paramount for competitive advantage. From these stats, we infer that it is high time business analysts learn machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness data-driven insights, predict trends, and optimize business processes. ML and AI empower analysts to extract valuable patterns from vast datasets, enabling informed decision-making and competitive advantage.\n\nTo read more about skills in demand, see the most In Demand Skills for Freelancers.\n\nHighest Paying Companies for Business Analysts\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are two of the highest paying companies for business analysts in 2024 with average annual salaries of $171,988 and $169.015 respectively, according to Glassdoor.com.\n\nSpeaking on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the company’s ascension to the third most valuable US company has confirmed the growing prominence of artificial intelligence in investment circles.

However, it was still the second-highest year for ETF volumes on record. iShares ETFs, led by iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE Arca: IWM), iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: HYG), and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ GM: TLT), represented $9.4 trillion of this activity. US equity markets traded nearly $127 trillion, making the US ETFs account for 30% of the total American composite volume in the secondary market in 2023. Meanwhile, US-listed Fixed Income ETFs had their second-largest year on record at $5.8 trillion, slightly behind the 2022 figures. Also, options trading in the US-listed ETFs reached record levels in 2023, with the industry totaling $130 trillion, up 24% year-over-year.\n\nThe ETF industry set a new record with 543 new ETFs launched in 2023, surpassing the previous record of just under 480 in 2021 by more than 60 funds. Approximately 75% of the newly launched funds in 2023 were actively managed. According to VettaFi’s Dave Nadig:\n\n“It was only a few years ago when we crossed 2,000 ETFs listed that the first ‘there are too many ETFs!’ complaints started up, and yet here we are. But the reality is there’s no cap on innovation. The products we’ve seen gain traction this year — the rise of active products, the narrow slices of the  market, options overlays, buffers, conversions — they weren’t really even a pipe dream five years ago, and they’re the stories of the year. ETFs have gained so much ground because they solve real problems for real investors.”\n\nLately, retail traders are increasingly utilizing exchange traded funds as a new tool during the recent Bitcoin rally. Newly launched funds, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ GM: IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (CBOE US: FBTC), and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (CBOE US: ARKB) have experienced a surge in trading volume. For instance, IBIT traded about 96 million shares on February 28, more than double its previous record, indicating significant retail interest. The Fidelity and ARK funds also saw substantial increases in shares traded, surpassing earlier records. The active market suggests that retail traders are leveraging these ETFs to participate in the Bitcoin rally, with the cryptocurrency crossing $60,000 for the first time since November 2021. Despite Bitcoin's 30% rise since the ETFs were approved, their prices have consistently increased over the past six weeks, contributing to the notable trading volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the best ETFs expose investors to stocks like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

The company also announced that Nvidia is a 10%+ customer.\n\nFabrinet was, notably, a top-five holding in the Fund before its June earnings announcement and, although we have trimmed our position, was our largest holding at the end of 2023. While we continue to evaluate what we believe is a positive incremental change in the company’s earnings power, we are seeking to take some profits in keeping with our risk management policies.”\n\n13.

BRK is a collection of high-quality businesses, excellent management, and a good amount of optionality in their cash position. If the cash were to be deployed accretively, the true value would be greater than an 8% premium (as mentioned above). The combination of a pie that is growing, an increasing share of said pie due to stock buybacks, upside optionality from cash and a tight range of likely business outcomes that span a variety of economic futures gives me comfort in continuing to own Berkshire.”\n\n11. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSE Arca: DGRO)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 9, 2024: 53.66%\n\niShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSE Arca: DGRO) aims to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, which is composed of US equities with a track record of consistent dividend growth.

We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses.

Given the large amount of revenue associated with drugs going off-patent, the new product portfolio was key to the company’s ability to change investor perception. Certain launches are not performing as expected, and others are taking longer to scale. Additionally, Bristol-Myers reduced medium-term operating margin guidance to invest in its commercial drugs and the research and development (R&D) pipeline. We do not believe that the company exhibited the level of defensiveness in the strategy we expected given the low valuation.”\n\n8.

LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices. Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal first quarter results, where revenues and earnings beat analyst estimates, driven in large part to growing Al demand. Regarding Intelligent Cloud segment, management noted Azure optimizations were similar to the previous quarter, but new Al and traditional workloads are helping drive greater consumption growth, which resulted in their first reacceleration since March 2022. We believe the strong Azure performance suggests diminishing cost optimization headwinds and growing strength in Al service consumption.”\n\n7.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), which saw significant price appreciation throughout much of 2023, saw its share price increase materially in Q4 following the company’s Q3 2023 earnings report. We have yet to see the long-awaited re-acceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth. However, in our estimation, the segment’s growth has likely bottomed, and we could see accelerating growth in 2024. Further, Amazon’s e-commerce business has gradually re-accelerated from 2022’s levels and, perhaps most importantly, the company’s margins and free cash flow have rebounded materially from last year. This rebound in margins and free cash flow at Amazon has been a key component of our long-term thesis for the business, and we expect the improvement in these metrics to continue into 2024 and beyond (though perhaps not linearly) as the company continues to optimize costs and capital expenditures. Our position in Amazon reflects our positive long-term expectations of the business, and it is currently our largest absolute weight in the Portfolio.”\n\n6. iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE Arca: OEF)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 9, 2024: 92.94%\n\niShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE Arca: OEF) aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 100 Index, which consists of 100 large-cap US equities.

AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform.

Alphabet also owns the world's second most-visited social site (YouTube), as well as the third-largest cloud infrastructure service (Google) behind AWS and Azure. Meta Platforms is the company behind Facebook, the most-visited social site globally. Including other popular social-media destinations (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads), Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's currently profitable on a recurring basis. Tesla produced close to 1.85 million EVs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also known for conducting stock splits -- Meta is the only Magnificent Seven component to have never split its shares.\n\nForget Nvidia: Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are likeliest to split first\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a public company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact to its market cap or operating performance. The Magnificent Seven are known for conducting forward-stock splits, which are designed to make shares more affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, quite a few of the Magnificent Seven have completed a forward-stock split, including:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 stock split. Amazon: 20-for-1 stock split. Alphabet: 20-for-1 stock split. Tesla: 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nGiven that a single Nvidia share is setting investors back by almost $860, as of the closing bell on March 5, you'd probably think it's a slam-dunk to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock. However, Nvidia is set to face an ever-growing mountain of headwinds this year, and there's a real possibility the company's stock is an epic bubble. In other words, a split may not be in the cards anytime soon.\n\nFor example, even though Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are dominating in high-compute data centers for the moment, competition is picking up in a big way. Advanced Micro Devices has begun its ramped rollout of the MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel anticipates launching its Gaudi3 AI chip later this year.\n\nWhat's far more concerning is that four Magnificent Seven members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet they're all developing their own high-powered AI chips. It's plainly evident that Nvidia's top customers are looking to lessen their reliance on GPUs from the current kingpin of AI.\n\nAdd in regulatory export concerns to China, a lack of insider buying, and the possibility of cannibalizing its own margins as its ramps A100 and H100 production, and there's potential for significant downside in Nvidia stock.\n\nInstead of Nvidia becoming Wall Street's next stock-split stock, two other Magnificent Seven components appear poised to beat it to the punch. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member I'd expect to split its stock before Nvidia is social media titan Meta Platforms. Shares of the company topped $500 for the first time ever on March 1.\n\nAlthough Meta has artificial intelligence tie-ins -- e.g., it's using generative AI solutions to help advertisers tailor their messages to individual users -- it wouldn't be susceptible to a bubble-bursting event if demand for AI infrastructure didn't meet investors' lofty expectations. This makes it more likely that Meta can sustain, if not build on, its nearly $500 share price.\n\nThe company's social media \"real estate\" is what makes it tick. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded social apps worldwide. Businesses are aware that no social media company offers a greater reach than what Meta can bring to the table. As a result, Meta's ad-pricing power is exceptional in most economic climates.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Meta is sitting on an ever-growing treasure chest of cash. It closed out last year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities in 2023.\n\nWhat all this cash does is allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take chances. Despite hefty operating losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, Zuckerberg is attempting to position Meta to be an on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of this decade. Few other companies have the luxury of taking chances the way Meta can.\n\nAnd unlike Nvidia, Meta remains historically inexpensive, even after its significant run-up from its 2022 bear market lows. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times estimated cash flow in 2025, which represents a substantial discount to Meta's multiple to its cash flow over the trailing decade.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven constituent that appears poised to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock before Nvidia is none other than tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft has split its shares nine times since going public, but last did so in February 2003. A single share of Microsoft is currently tipping the scales at north of $400.\n\nMicrosoft didn't reach a $3 trillion valuation and become the largest publicly traded by accident. It's achieved this distinction by seamlessly blending its legacy cash-cow segments with its fast-paced growth initiatives.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, Microsoft's legacy operations are still exceptionally profitable. Even though Windows has lost desktop operating system (OS) share over the past decade, it remains the undisputed OS leader in personal computing. The cash flow Microsoft generates from the likes of Windows and Office allows it to reinvest in high-growth initiatives and/or make acquisitions.\n\nIn terms of \"high-growth initiatives,\" cloud services and AI take the cake. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for Azure catapulted 28% higher during the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative early innings, which suggests Azure can continue to capture global cloud infrastructure service spend share, as well as sustain a double-digit growth rate with ease.\n\nMicrosoft's AI ambitions are also on display. It's invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, incorporated AI solutions into search engine Bing, and plans to lean on various generative AI solutions to assist businesses with document processing and conversational AI on the Azure platform.\n\nLastly, Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies that sports the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, Microsoft's legacy operations and cloud services wouldn't miss a beat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Cue bubble warnings on Wall and Broad.\n\nThe market’s relentless rally has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 25% from its October lows, fueled by gains in only a handful of stocks.\n\nLeading the charge is AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker has gained more than 80% since the start of the year, helping drive the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to record levels.\n\nThe concentrated outperformance has prompted some on Wall Street to warn the rally has gone too far and declare stocks are in bubble territory.\n\nMarket concentration has surged to a multi-decade high. The 10 largest US stocks now account for 33% of the S&P 500 market cap and 25% of S&P 500 earnings, according to Goldman Sachs data.\n\nBut concerns over narrow market participation and frothiness may be misguided. In the last week, several top Wall Street strategists made it clear on Yahoo Finance’s \"Morning Brief\" that there’s reason to believe the market will keep going up.\n\n\"This might be the best sell-side trick out there right now. … I don't think that's justified,\" Citi US equity strategy director Drew Pettit said of the bubble fear on Yahoo Finance Live. \"It’s actually a lot healthier than people are giving it credit for.\"\n\nStrong quarterly results from Big Tech have bolstered the bull case. Nvidia posted another blowout quarter thanks to surging AI demand, while Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) topped expectations.\n\nHigher profit margins and proven returns are two reasons Wedbush analyst Dan Ives describes the current market environment as a \"1995 moment\" rather than comparing it to the start of the dot-com bubble.\n\n\"This is nowhere near the 1999/2000 period in our view as the sky high valuations, lack of monetization/ infrastructure, weak balance sheets, froth business models, and macro backdrop was in a totally different world back then compared to what we see today,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nCiti's head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely echoed Ives’s bullish view on tech, telling Yahoo Finance he \"doesn’t see any end in sight.\"\n\n\"We've got a long way to go until we're going to start ringing the alarm bells or even hear a tinkling of bells,\" Danely told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBeyond tech and beneath the surface, underlying trends are positive. Market breadth — an indication of bullish sentiment — has slowly started to improve. The S&P 500 equal weight index (^SPXEW) and small caps outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month.\n\n\"The broadening out we’re seeing is happening in a stealthy way,\" Charles Schwab’s Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance, adding that churn under the surface is \"not a bad thing.\"\n\nAnd, it’s important to note, history says elevated concentration isn’t necessarily indicative of a market top. Goldman Sachs analyzed market concentrations spanning the past 100 years and found the S&P 500 rallied more often than not following past concentration peaks.\n\n\"One consistent pattern around periods of elevated concentration is large swings in Momentum,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. \"While the performance of the high Momentum leaders was inconsistent, the previous laggards appreciated in absolute terms in every episode. This supports our view that a \"catch up\" by laggards is more likely to interrupt the ongoing Momentum rally than a 'catch down' by the recent market leaders.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Citi strategy director Drew Pettit.

        "title": "A Third \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Just Broke Below This Key Indicator. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.\n\nAlphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.\n\nWatching where a stock has been\n\nThe 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.\n\nFor example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign. NVDA Chart\n\nThe 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock. GOOGL Chart\n\nNotice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.\n\nIn the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.\n\nUnderstanding market sentiment\n\nA great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.\n\nIf you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.\n\nAnother recent example is Target(NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.\n\nIn sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.\n\nUsing moving averages to your advantage\n\nThe best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.\n\nIn other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.\n\nIt happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.\n\nThe point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.\n\nWhat the Alphabet sell-off tells us\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.\n\nApple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.\n\nThe market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It is also punishing companies that should be leading AI but have lagged behind the competition (like Alphabet).\n\nThe market as a whole can offset the losses from Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla largely because other sectors are doing well, too. Industrials, financials, and consumer staples are examples of sectors outside of big tech that are all making new 52-week highs.\n\nAlphabet breaking below its 200-day moving average is a sign that there could be further selling pressure. But if you believe the investment thesis hasn't changed, then you may want to ignore this signal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 fastest declining cities in Florida. If you would like to skip our discussion on the state's economy, you can go to the 5 Fastest Declining Cities in Florida.\n\nFlorida has the 4th largest economy in the US and ranks 14th globally, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of over $1.1 trillion in 2023. The state's economy has shown a steady growth rate of 1.8% over the past 5 years. In the third quarter of 2023, the GDP rose by 6.1%, higher than the 2.3% growth in the second quarter. Looking at the growth forecast for 2024, Florida’s economy is predicted to expand by 3.0%, which is higher than the national economy's expected growth of 1.4%. Additionally, the housing sector is expected to grow in 2024 after a drop in sales and construction in 2023. Single-family construction is expected to lead, adding about 150,000 units to Florida's housing supply, while multifamily construction is projected to contribute about 55,000 units to the market.\n\nCurrently, Florida has a 3% unemployment rate, and projections for 2024 suggest the addition of 100,000 to 150,000 new jobs. The trend of slower job growth observed in the final months of 2023 is expected to continue in the coming year. Overall job growth for 2024 is estimated to fall within the range of 1.0% to 1.5%. Certain industries, such as Professional Business Services, Financial Activities, and Information, may encounter slowing growth or even declines, while the Education and Health Services sector is expected to experience an increase in employment opportunities. While Florida is experiencing a population decline in almost half of its cities, it still ranks as the 3rd most populous state in the US and stands as the 5th fastest-growing state in the country. Over the past decade, Florida's population has grown by 18%, increasing from 18.8 million in 2010 to 22.2 million as of 2022. Among the fastest growing cities in Florida, West Lake City leads with a 306% growth rate, increasing from 1,048 residents in 2020 to 4,255 in 2022. Davenport city follows with a 39.5% growth rate, witnessing an increase in population from 9,665 in 2020 to 13,485 in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of revenue, Florida's top industries include professional employer organizations, wireless telecommunications carriers, and new car dealers, generating $129.8 billion, $89.6 billion, and $85.1 billion, respectively, in 2023. The professional, scientific, and technical services, real estate and rental and leasing, and healthcare and social assistance sectors collectively contributed 40.0% to Florida's GDP in 2023. Some of the key industry leaders are contributing to employment opportunities in the state, positively impacting the employment rate. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are amongst the largest employers in Florida, with 115,866, 77,000, and 49,000 employees, respectively, in 2023.\n\nHere's what Baron Funds said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares of Amazon were up 19.5% in the quarter and finished the year up 80.9%. Reported quarterly results were better than consensus estimates with 11% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, a significant beat in North American operating profit as operating margins reached 4.9% and a recovery in the cloud division, AWS, which grew 12% year-over-year and management reported that the impact of customer optimizations was attenuating. We believe that AWS has many years of growth ahead as IT budgets continue switching from on premise to the cloud and as Amazon remains the clear leader in the market, with large incremental opportunities in application software, including enabling GenAI workloads. We also believe Amazon is well positioned in the short-to-medium term to further improve core North American retail profitability to above pre-pandemic levels, benefiting from its new regionalized fulfillment network and its growing margin-accretive advertising business. Longer term, Amazon has substantially more room to grow in e-commerce, where it has less than 15% penetration of the total addressable market.” 12 Fastest Declining Cities in Florida\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 12 fastest declining cities in Florida, we examined the most recent available census data from 2022.

        "title": "Stock bubble fears are overblown despite Magnificent 7's rally: Wall Street analysts",
        "content": "The market’s relentless rally has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 25% from its October lows, fueled by gains in only a handful of stocks.\n\nLeading the charge is AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker has gained more than 80% since the start of the year, helping drive the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to record levels.\n\nThe concentrated outperformance has prompted some on Wall Street to warn the rally has gone too far and declare stocks are in bubble territory.\n\nMarket concentration has surged to a multi-decade high. The 10 largest US stocks now account for 33% of S&P 500 market cap and 25% of S&P 500 earnings, according to Goldman Sachs data.\n\nBut concerns over narrow market participation and frothiness may be misguided. Several top Wall Street strategists made it clear on Yahoo Finance’s \"Morning Brief\" last week that there’s reason to believe the market will keep going up.\n\n\"This might be the best sell side trick out there right now… I don't think that's justified,\" Citi US Equity Strategy Director Drew Petit said of the bubble fear on Yahoo Finance Live. \"It’s actually a lot healthier than people are giving it credit for.\"\n\nStrong quarterly results from big tech have bolstered the bull case. Nvidia posted another blow out quarter thanks to surging AI demand, while Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) topped expectations.\n\nHigher profit margins and proven returns are two reasons Wedbush analyst Dan Ives describes the current market environment as a \"1995 moment\" rather than comparing it to the start of the dotcom bubble.\n\n\"This is nowhere near the 1999/2000 period in our view as the sky high valuations, lack of monetization/ infrastructure, weak balance sheets, froth business models, and macro backdrop was in a totally different world back then compared to what we see today,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nCiti's head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely echoed Ives’s bullish view on tech, telling Yahoo Finance he \"doesn’t see any end in sight.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We've got a long way to go until we're going to start ringing the alarm bells or even hear a tinkling of bells,\" Danely told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBeyond tech and beneath the surface, underlying trends are positive. Market breadth — an indication of bullish sentiment — has slowly started to improve. The S&P 500 equal weight index (SPXEW) and small caps outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month.\n\n\"The broadening out we’re seeing is happening in a stealthy way,\" Charles Schwab’s Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance, adding that churn under the surface is \"not a bad thing.\"\n\nAnd, it’s important to note, history says elevated concentration isn’t necessarily indicative of a market top. Goldman Sachs analyzed market concentrations spanning the past 100 years, and found the S&P 500 rallied more often than not following past concentration peaks.\n\n\"One consistent pattern around periods of elevated concentration is large swings in Momentum,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. \"While the performance of the high Momentum leaders was inconsistent, the previous laggards appreciated in absolute terms in every episode. This supports our view that a \"catch up\" by laggards is more likely to interrupt the ongoing Momentum rally than a 'catch down' by the recent market leaders.\"\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Resilient US shoppers are driving divergent fortunes for retail stocks",
        "content": "\"We've said for quite some time now, it has been a resilient consumer.\"\n\nThat was the comment to me this week from Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell on his earnings day. Well, that along with his shout-out to $500 million in cost cuts last year ($1.5 billion is the longer-term goal). I happened to mention I bought Beyond Meat (BYND) meatballs the day before our interview from my local Target.\n\nWe laughed, kept it moving, and then I went home for the day to monitor overseas markets.\n\nBut Cornell's observation on shoppers left an impression. First, he is right, and second, it's something that goes a long way to understanding why the Federal Reserve has pushed back on a market narrative of more than five interest rate cuts for 2024.\n\nThe economy just doesn't need these aggressive cuts, judging by the health of its biggest driver — the US consumer.\n\nFebruary's employment report on Friday was another strong one, posting a gain of 275,000. Wages are up, prices have cooled. The stock market is doing great, making households with stock portfolios feel wealthier (aka wealth effect). Consumer confidence dipped a little last month but hasn't fallen off a cliff for some unexplained reason.\n\n\"Consumers are shopping,\" Cornell added, noting that Target's store traffic improved in the fourth quarter from its run rate seen throughout most of 2023.\n\nEY economist Greg Daco tells me there are several reasons for an upbeat consumer, among them labor market resilience and healthy household balance sheets.\n\n\"The increased value of talent post-pandemic has meant that business managers are more reluctant to let go of their prized talent pool despite cost pressures and expectations of slower final demand growth,\" Daco explained.\n\n\"Solid employment growth combined with robust wage growth has translated into strong real disposable income growth, which in turn has allowed consumers to continue paying high prices for goods and services.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mr. Market has sniffed all of this out.\n\nThe VanEck Retail ETF (RTH) — which counts Amazon (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), Costco (COST), Walmart (WMT), and Lowe's (LOW) as its top five holdings — is up 9.2% year to date, compared to the 6.5% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Shares of Home Depot and Lowe's hit 52-week highs this week, per one of my nifty Yahoo Finance screeners.\n\nAnd in this resilient (though not gangbusters) backdrop, the winners and losers in retail are becoming very clear. Consumers don't have endless money, but those who have discretionary dollars are spending them at places they value.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) had a mind-boggling 21% sales gain in the fourth quarter. CEO Fran Horowitz (video above) told me the chain continues to gobble up market share among 20- to late-30-year-olds. Rival American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) showed a 12% year-over-year sales increase in the holiday quarter.\n\nBeleaguered mall staple Gap is starting to turn things around, with its Old Navy and Gap brands both clocking year-over-year growth in Q4. Its CEO Richard Dickson told Yahoo Finance that the retailer has gained market share during the quarter. Richard Dickson quote\n\nDiscretionary departments, such as home goods and apparel, did better in the fourth quarter at Target and Walmart.\n\nMeanwhile, the losers are really losing.\n\nFoot Locker (FL) and Victoria's Secret (VSCO) had awful quarters, and the market bid down their stock prices by more than 30% in a day this week.\n\nNordstrom (JWN) warned sales trends stayed soft at its full-price banner. Macy's (M) quarter was bad.\n\n\"The customer has a choice, and they're choosing us,\" Horowitz said.\n\nThe Fed has a choice too on rates ... and consumer resilience suggests its choice should be easy in 2024.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 25 largest retailers in the U.S. and the world in 2024. This article will focus on recent industry trends and the major players in the retail industry. If you want to skip our analysis, you can proceed to the section highlighting the 5 Largest Retailers in the U.S. and the World in 2024.\n\nAn Analysis of the Retail Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at $28.84 trillion in 2023, The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% and is forecasted to reach $42.75 trillion by the end of 2028. The demand for supermarkets, hypermarkets, discount stores, and out-of-town retail parks is also on the rise. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific was the largest and fastest-growing region in the retail market due to its continued population and economic growth. Meanwhile, North America was the second-largest region in the retail market. Its saturated market stabilizes the global retail industry. The leading demand segments within the retail industry include pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, electronics and household appliances, furniture, and toys.\n\nAccording to an article by Deloitte, there are several key trends shaping the retail industry in 2024.

Moreover, companies are also leveraging blockchain technology to improve the transparency of their supply chain operations.\n\nHowever, the global retail industry is currently facing challenges due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts. The Red Sea, which serves as the gateway to the southern entry of the Suez Canal, is one of the world's vital and heavily trafficked maritime routes. According to statistics by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand, around 12% of international trade passes through the Suez Canal, accounting for 30% of global container traffic and exceeding $1 trillion in goods annually. The canal reduces the maritime distance between Asia and Europe almost by half. The recent Middle East conflict has disrupted access to vital waterways due to Houthi rebel attacks on ships in the Red Sea. According to a report by Kiel Trade, the Red Sea's container shipment volume dropped to about 200,000 containers per day in December 2023, down from 500,0000 containers per day in November 2023, marking a 66% decline from the expected volume based on 2017 to 2019 data.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Players in the Retail Industry\n\nSome of the largest players in the retail industry include Walmart Inc.

Highlights include: higher transaction counts and unit volumes; gains in market share in the U.S. and internationally; improved in-stock levels with inventory being in great shape and down versus last year; strong performance in Walmart U.S. customer experience scores, even during the high volume days before Christmas. Plus, this year, we passed $100  billion in global e-commerce sales for the first time. We had a very good holiday season.

To rank the largest companies, we first sifted through the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to find the most prominent and largest retail companies. We then consulted the Fortune Global 500 list, which is an annual ranking of the world's largest corporations based on their fiscal year revenues. For companies that are publicly traded, we got their trailing twelve-month revenue from YCharts. Relevant data for some of the foreign publicly traded companies was not available at YCharts, therefore, we got their trailing twelve-month revenue from Yahoo Finance. For companies that are not publicly traded, we sourced their annual revenue for the most recent fiscal year from the Fortune Global 500 rankings or official company statements. We have listed the 25 largest retailers in the U.S. and the world by revenue below in ascending order of their trailing twelve-month revenue and annual revenue.\n\n25 Largest Retailers in the U.S. and the World in 2024\n\n25.

        "content": "So far in 2024 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven’t done well at all, falling 28% and 11.5%, respectively. As a result, it appears that they aren’t so “magnificent” and their spots in the Magnificent 7 should probably be taken by other tech stocks.\n\nTherefore, in this column I will take the initiative by selecting their replacements. Among the criteria I have used in choosing replacements are the strength of firms’ businesses, the extent to which they have positive outlooks and the performance of their stocks over the last year. I’ll also add an extra nominee in case another one of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks start stumbling soon.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is benefiting tremendously from selling servers and other hardware that work in tandem with chips that produce artificial intelligence. Last quarter, for example, its top line more than doubled versus the same period a year earlier, while its bottom line climbed to $296 million from $176 million during the identical quarter in 2022.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the continued, rapid proliferation of AI and data centers’ affinity for SMCI’s products, the firm has a very bright future. Supporting this, investment bank Arguswrote that SMCI is primed for multiple years of strong top-line growth and margin expansion. The bank even compared the stock to Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their earlier days.\n\nSMCI stock had jumped an incredible 299% in the last three months and 1,028% over the last year.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) provides software that automates IT tasks, and the company launched a very successful AI-powered app in Q3 of 2023.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Bill McDermott, indicated in January that NOW had been able to charge extraordinarily high prices for its AI app. He also suggested that the firm’s AI app raises companies’ productivity levels by 40%-50%. Going forward, NOW should continue to benefit from companies’ strong demand for high-quality AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, NOW’s top line jumped 26% versus the same period a year earlier, and it expects its income from operations to soar 29% during the current quarter. Then last month, investment bank Argus hiked its price target on NOW stock to $910 from $770. The bank expects the company to benefit from continued upgrades to its AI app.\n\nThe shares have advanced 10% in the last three months and 82% over the last 12 months.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is a South American e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe firm has an impressive user base of 218 million, while its EPS more than doubled last year. According to Barron’s, EPS is expected to climb 80% in 2024.\n\nInvestment bank BTIG recommends buying MELI stock on weakness after the company reported that its gross margins fell last quarter, while its bottom line came in below analysts’ average estimate due to a tax payment.\n\nAlso impressed with the firm’s Q4 results was one of its investors, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund. In a letter to its clients, the fund wrote that MELI had delivered an impressive balance of growth and profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI and AMZN and his wife held a long position in NOW.

        "title": "Meet the 5 Stocks That Have Contributed Almost All of the S&amp;P 500's 2024 Gains",
        "content": "Containing the 500 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies by market cap, the S&P 500 is arguably the best indicator of the performance of the overall U.S. stock market. At least, it has been in the past.\n\nBut something is happening that's making the index's performance somewhat misleading. As of March 6, the S&P 500 has gained 7.0% year to date. But 6.5 percentage points of that gain are due to the performance of just five companies.\n\nYou may be wondering how this is possible, given the index is so massive. Are the other 495 companies really putting up mediocre results?\n\nLet's look at these growth stocks, their impact on the market, and what it means for your portfolio (whether or not you're invested in them). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2024 market leaders\n\nThe following table showcases why huge gains from overweighted components of the S&P 500 can move the whole index.\n\nCompany YTD Gain Weight in S&P 500 Percentage Point Contribution to S&P 500 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 79.2% 5.0% 3.9% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 40.2% 2.6% 1.0% Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) 14.2% 3.7% 0.5% Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) 33.8% 1.5% 0.5% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 6.6% 7.0% 0.5%\n\nData sources: Slickcharts and YCharts as of Mar. 6, 2024. YTD = year to date.\n\nNvidia and Meta Platforms alone are responsible for over half of this year's gains for the index. Microsoft is another interesting case; as the highest-weighted component of the S&P 500 (yes, even more than Apple), it doesn't take a big move for it to affect the index. Drugmaker Eli Lilly makes up just 1.5% of the S&P 500, but it's strong rally this year has been enough to move the index half a percentage point higher.\n\nCombined, these five companies make up 19.7% of the S&P 500. A little math tells us that, on average, the other 495 companies have gained just 0.7% this year (adjusted for their weightings in the index).\n\nDissecting the S&P 500's moves\n\nThere are a few ways to unpack this information. The obvious takeaway is that the market's roaring start really is due to a handful of companies. But a more subtle realization is that the market will have difficulty sustaining these gains from these leading constituents.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Eli Lilly have put up big numbers. The story has carried over into 2024, but it may soon begin to run out of steam through no fault of these five companies. Data by YCharts.\n\nAs we've seen repeatedly in past market cycles, valuations can only expand so much before fundamentals must catch up. The good news is that earnings from this cohort are growing. Nvidia is arguably the best example.\n\nOn the surface, its 74.4 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio looks sky-high, but analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to roughly double over the next year, so its forward P/E ratio is a much more reasonable 36.1. In fact, it's on par with Microsoft while coming in lower than Tesla, Amazon, and Eli Lilly.\n\nGrowth can make rapid run-ups in stock prices justifiable. It's just that the faster and higher stock prices run, especially when they have this level of impact on the broader market, the more stretched the market becomes and the more room there is for a sell-off.\n\nThe path forward\n\n2023 and 2024 have been fascinating years in the market. The highest-weighted companies are also some of the market's top gainers -- concentrating the gains of the overall index in just a few companies.\n\nIt doesn't matter where the gains come from if you own an S&P 500 index fund, but if you don't own these companies, your returns may vary wildly from the broad market's. The tech sector alone makes up 29.5% of the index. In fact, it's the only sector to have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years. So, if you didn't own tech or the market's top movers outside of tech, it would have been challenging to beat the market during this period.\n\nNo one knows what will happen over the next five years, but we do know what has driven the market over the last five. Market dynamics can help you understand what's happening in the short term -- the trick is to not lose sight of what really matters, which is achieving your financial goals.\n\nHitching a ride on a hot trend to make a quick buck is a common way to lose money. A better approach is to focus on a long-term investment thesis and compounding wealth over time. The real gains in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Eli Lilly have come to those who have held the stocks for five years, a decade, or even longer. The road hasn't been easy as most of these companies have endured brutal sell-offs, most recently in 2022's bear market.\n\nIf you want to invest in growth but don't know where to start, there are plenty of inexpensive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worth checking out that achieve diversification and the benefits of a hands-off approach.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation",
        "content": "The stock market has seen a lot of movement in recent years, with external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, a subsequent economic downturn, and a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) creating plenty of peaks and valleys. In fact, the Nasdaq Composite index plunged 33% in 2022, then rose 43% the following year.\n\nHowever, recent volatility appears to be subsiding as inflation eases and excitement over tech fuels a market recovery. As a result, now is an excellent time to dedicate a larger portion of your portfolio to the expanding tech market and reap the rewards long into the future.\n\nHere are three no-brainer stocks I'd buy right now without hesitation.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has appeared unstoppable over the last year as it became the poster child for AI. The company's stock is up 260% since last March, rallying investors while snapping up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips.\n\nIncreased demand for AI services boosted sales of graphics processing unit (GPU), the chips crucial for training AI models. As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has massively profited from rising demand for GPUs.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024 ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nNvidia has massive potential as the AI market develops, and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates reflect this. The chart above shows Nvidia's earnings could reach just over $34 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the tech giant's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35 yields a stock price of $1,197.\n\nLooking at its current position, these projections would see Nvidia's stock increase 39% by fiscal 2027, making it a screaming buy right now.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nLike Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has much to gain from the rise of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030. Its massive growth potential suggests Nvidia will be able to retain its dominance and despite newcomers like AMD.\n\nAMD was slightly late to the AI party. However, it is making moves to take a slice of the $200 billion industry and could see major gains over the long term.\n\nLast December, the company unveiled its new MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nMoreover, AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. This segment is expected to see a significant boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe table above shows AMD's earnings could reach top $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia, multiplying this figure by AMD's forward P/E of 58 yields a stock price of $403, projecting that its stock will nearly double in price within two years.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer almost 30 years ago. The company has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nAmazon dominates e-commerce in dozens of countries, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and develop at a CAGR of 10% through 2028. The company will likely continue profiting from the segment's tailwinds for years.\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In Q4 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.\n\nMoreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nLike Nvidia and AMD, EPS estimates project massive potential for Amazon's stock. This table indicates that the e-commerce giant's earnings will achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by Amazon's forward P/E of 42, you get a stock price of $294.\n\nFrom its current position, this would see Amazon's stock rise 68% over the next two fiscal years. Alongside dominating positions in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon is a no-brainer buy this March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Most Likely to Deliver a 5X Gain by 2030: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You won't have to look hard to find well-known stocks that have been multi-baggers in recent years. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) share price has more than quadrupled since 2014. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up more than 9x during the same period. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered a gain of over 10x. Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has soared 7x. Then there's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), with its share price skyrocketing in the ballpark of 19,400%.\n\nBut those impressive returns are now history. Which of these stocks is likely to deliver a 5x gain by 2030?\n\nStrong growth prospects all around\n\nI think all five of these stocks should have strong growth prospects going forward. They share a common tailwind that's likely to blow hard for years to come -- artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud are poised for tremendous growth, in my view, as IT spending shifts from on-premises to the cloud. The scramble to build AI functionality should accelerate this trend. Nvidia will almost certainly be a direct beneficiary of this migration. The company's GPUs remain the favorite chip for powering AI apps.\n\nMeta isn't a cloud provider or a chipmaker. However, the company's open-source approach to developing AI could pay off nicely over the long term. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks that the benefits of this strategy include increased AI safety and security, a greater ability to integrate new AI innovations into Meta's products, and a competitive advantage in hiring the best developers and researchers.\n\nAI isn't the only growth driver for these five stocks, though. Amazon still has plenty of room to run in the e-commerce market and other areas it's expanding into, including healthcare. Microsoft's opportunities include gaming, especially with the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Alphabet has its famous \"other bets,\" such as healthcare-focused Calico and Verily. Meta is investing heavily in developing the metaverse. Nvidia's initial success came from powering gaming apps, and it still represents a major growth market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNarrowing the list\n\nI like all of these stocks. I think all of them could deliver solid long-term returns. But we must narrow the list to pick a winner.\n\nWhich is the first to be eliminated? My pick is Meta. The company won't profit as directly from AI as the three cloud service providers or Nvidia. Meta's big bet on the metaverse might not pay off by 2030 (or possibly ever). Its social media platforms, while continuing to dominate, don't have as much growth potential as they have in the past.\n\nNext on the chopping block for me is Amazon. E-commerce remains the company's biggest revenue source. As mentioned previously, it's still a growth opportunity for Amazon. However, that opportunity isn't as great as the ones that other companies on our list have. This could make it more challenging for Amazon stock to soar by 5x by 2030.\n\nI'm going to reluctantly strike Microsoft off the list as well. My primary determining factor here is valuation. Microsoft's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on Wall Street's consensus five-year growth projections is over 2x, the highest multiple of all of these stocks except Amazon. Granted, those growth projections could be overly pessimistic. Still, I suspect that it would be more difficult for Microsoft stock to increase by 5x going forward because of its starting valuation.\n\nThe finalists\n\nThat leaves two finalists -- Alphabet and Nvidia. Choosing between them is tough.\n\nIn addition to continued growth with its current apps and Google Cloud, Alphabet could have a massive growth driver with its Waymo self-driving car business. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest predicts that the robotaxi market could be worth $9 trillion by 2030. Waymo is likely to be a leader in that market. Google also ranks as a top innovator in quantum computing technology, which could be another game-changer.\n\nAlphabet does face some risks, though. Ark Invest's robotaxi market prediction could be way too optimistic. It could take much longer to achieve the potential for quantum computing than anyone expects. AI-powered virtual assistants could dampen Google Search's growth down the road. Alphabet's \"other bets\" could be disappointing.\n\nWhat about Nvidia? It's arguably the most important company in the world right now. Every other company on our list (plus thousands of others) relies heavily on Nvidia's GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang thinks that the shift to accelerated computing and generative AI \"will drive a doubling of the world's data-center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\" If he's right, Nvidia could realistically deliver a 5x return by 2030.\n\nOn the other hand, NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran believes that Nvidia is the most overvalued \"Magnificent Seven\" stock by far, even factoring in strong growth projections. The company also faces increased competition in the AI chip market, which could grow even stronger over the next few years.\n\nMost likely to deliver a 5x gain\n\nSo which stock is most likely to deliver a 5x gain? I'm going to give the nod to Nvidia. The company should profit from pretty much every technology growth market around -- AI, gaming, self-driving cars, the metaverse, and more. That said, I don't think becoming a five-bagger again will be easy for Nvidia (because of the challenges I've already mentioned).\n\nPerhaps the most important takeaway from this hypothetical exercise is that all of these stocks could make investors plenty of money over the long run. I don't think you'd go wrong with buying Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia as long as you hold onto the stocks long enough.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "TipRanks ‘Perfect 10’ List: Amazon and Alibaba Have the Best Smart Score Among Large-Cap Stocks",
        "content": "Stock picking has long been thought of as an art, but the savvy investor knows that there is also plenty of science to it. And for those willing to embrace the science, TipRanks has the Smart Score, an AI-driven data sorting tool, based on sophisticated natural language algorithms.\n\nThe tool gathers the reams of data thrown up by the stock markets – the transactions, the stock movements, the traders’ moves, all of it. The result is distilled down to a simple, easily readable score, a single number on a scale of 1 to 10, showing investors at a glance the likely trajectory for any stock. And the ‘Perfect 10’ stocks are the shares that clearly deserve closer scrutiny.\n\nRight now, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) are setting the pace, boasting the highest Smart Score among large-cap stocks on the ‘Perfect 10’ list. Let’s see what it is about these names that makes them stand out from the pack.\n\nAmazon\n\nWe’ll start with Amazon, a company that needs little introduction. This survivor of the original dot-com bubble has expanded from its origin as an online bookseller to become the world’s largest online retailer, dealing in anything and everything – and in the process, also becoming the world’s fourth-largest publicly traded firm, with a market cap of $1.8 trillion and approximately $1.4 billion in daily sales.\n\nAmazon has complemented its mega-cap size and near-endless online retail offerings with a huge brick-and-mortar infrastructure and rapid delivery guarantees. The company has a global network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, with some facilities totaling more than 1 million square feet of storage and workspace. The company can deliver customer orders around the world, and in many locations can offer next-day delivery. As an online retailer, Amazon depends on its website, which is one of the internet’s most trafficked – receiving well over 2 billion site visits every month.\n\nThat’s just Amazon’s eCommerce business. eCommerce is the core of the company, but Amazon is branching out, working to diversify the products it offers to ensure that it can meet customer needs in an ever-changing world. The company has a popular cloud computing service, AWS, available by subscription, that has become an important source of revenue. In addition, Amazon offers its customers such widely varied services as online gaming for both kids and adults; home automation; TV streaming; ebooks via the Kindle reader; and even grocery deliveries – the full list of services encompasses these, and many more. The common denominator is putting online retail and subscription models to work in the real world, and in people’s daily lives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat this comes down to for investors is simple: $170 billion in revenue reported in the last quarter, 4Q23. That represented a near-14% increase from the prior-year period, and was $3.74 billion better than had been anticipated. The company’s bottom line, the firm’s $1 EPS, was derived from a net income of $10.6 billion. AWS proved to be an important driver in the quarterly gains, generating $24.2 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year.\n\nFor 2023 as a whole, Amazon brought in $574.8 billion in total revenue. Net income for the year came to $30.4 billion, or $2.90 per diluted share. The company boasted a free cash flow of $36.8 billion for 2023, contrasted with a cash burn of $11.6 billion in the prior year.\n\nFor Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz, the key point here is Amazon’s proven ability to continue generating income growth – even on top of its already fast pace. He writes of the company, “Despite outperforming the market by ~60 points over the last year, Amazon remains one of our top picks in our coverage, due to the increasingly compelling operating income growth that the company is slated to deliver in the coming years… Given our constructive outlook on the shape of advertising operating income in the coming years, we raise our 24/25 OI estimates by 10/8%, respectively, and take our price target higher to $210. We continue to believe that GAAP earnings valuation for Amazon screens increasingly compelling…”\n\nThis adds up to a Buy rating, of course, and the $210 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of nearly 20%. (To watch Horowitz’s track record, click here)\n\nThis tech and retail mega-cap stock has picked up no fewer than 41 analyst reviews in recent weeks – and they are all positive, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating on the shares. AMZN is selling for $175.35, and its $208.48 average target price implies a gain of almost 19% on the one-year horizon. (See AMZN stock analysis)\n\nAlibaba Holdings\n\nNext up is Alibaba, another giant of the online retail industry – and the company that some call ‘China’s Amazon.’ Founded by Chinese tech entrepreneur and billionaire Jack Ma, and based in Hangzhou, the company has been in business since 1999. Alibaba started out as the main online retailer focusing on China’s domestic market and is still the dominant eCommerce player in this country of 1.4 billion people. Alibaba has branched out to the global online marketplace, but China remains the core of its business.\n\nThat business core is solid. Alibaba boasts that it can deliver just about any product, to just about any buyer, to just about any location in China – and can guarantee next-day or 2-day delivery. On the global eCommerce scene, Alibaba lists some 200 million-plus products available, across 5,900 product categories, coming from over 200,000 suppliers with delivery to more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nIn addition to online retail, both in China and abroad, Alibaba, like Amazon, is branching out into other areas. The company has its hands in several pots, including cloud services and digital media. Retail, however, still makes up the bulk of the company’s business; in fiscal year 2022, the company brought in 67% of its revenue from the Chinese retail sector, with another 5% from international commerce.\n\nIn the last reported quarter ending December 31, Alibaba posted total revenue of US$36.67 billion, marking a 5% year-over-year increase and surpassing forecasts by $270 million. The eCommerce giant’s earnings, by non-GAAP measures, came to $2.67 per share, or 3 cents per share better than the estimates. The company generated $7.96 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Despite these successes, shares in BABA are down 5% so far this year, in somewhat volatile trading over the past 2 months.\n\nThe fall in share price has not prevented Truist’s 5-star analyst, Youssef Squali, from coming down firmly on the bullish side for BABA stock. He sees Alibaba well positioned to move forward, and lays out four reasons why: “1) compelling valuation (1x EV/Revs and 4.4x EV/AEBITDA), 2) improving order volume growth at Taobao/Tmall fueled by greater focus and investments, 3) strong FCF generation (11% FCF yield) which is fueling a capital return strategy with larger buybacks and dividends; and 4) prospects for a macro recovery as mgmt strengthens its competitive offerings for TTG, Int’l and Cloud. CY24 will be an investment year for BABA which should keep margins in check near-term, that said we believe that much of it is already reflected in the current valuation.”\n\nGoing forward from there, Squali gives BABA stock a Buy rating, and sets a $114 price target that suggests the shares will appreciate by 55% over the course of this year. (To watch Squali’s track record, click here)\n\nAlibaba’s stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 18 recent reviews that include 15 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock is currently priced at $73.55 and its $101.55 average price target implies a 38% upside potential for the next 12 months.

        "content": "Finding the best-kept Wall Street secrets is tough because, well, if it were easy, they wouldn’t be secrets. Today’s top stocks tend to be large-cap tech names with rapid (and arguably unsustainable) growth that frustrates latecomer investors when that momentum slows.\n\nThat’s why, to find the best-kept Wall Street secrets, you need to satisfy two core criteria: identify emerging market opportunities and find small- or medium-cap stocks with great growth stats that target the new sector. These three stocks demonstrate that strong growth while their respective industries—B2B eCommerce, ready-to-drink alcohol, and work-from-home furniture—are just beginning a long and fruitful upward trajectory.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) e-commerce stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe know that globalized, direct-to-purchaser eCommerce will only keep climbing in popularity – think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) is similar, but as one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets, the eCommerce company targets the massive B2B market to create a one-stop shop for businesses to source products and manage everything that entails.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProduct and inventory management – not to mention sourcing and payment processing – are a tough nut to crack for medium-sized businesses. GigaCloud offers the full suite of scaled B2B eCommerce needs, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment, and, critically, facilitates cross-border payment safely and securely.\n\nOn its face, the company’s price-to-earnings ratio is surprisingly low, sitting at just 19x compared to the wider tech sector’s 36 times average ratio. The difference is even starker when you look at GigaCloud’s earnings growth. The company doubled its earnings per share over the past four quarters, with free cash flow per share staying strong—even as, critically, the company trades at just 0.68 times sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nVita Coco Company (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeverage stocks like Monster (NASDAQ:MNST) and Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) remain all the rage, but one competitor—Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO)—remains one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets. While the energy drink markets, and even standard sports drink segments, face steep competition, Vita Coco stands alone among coconut water vendors. The company owns more than half the total addressable market today.\n\nBetter yet, through a strategic partnership with British booze brand Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), Vita Coco is making inroads toward the ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage market with a range of spiked coconut water options. While coconut water mixed with Captain Morgan isn’t my cup of tea, that emerging market is exploding and expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2029—and Vita Coco is set to snag a large portion of that market.\n\nOn the financial front, Vita Coco blew analysts away with an end-of-year 4% earnings beat, driven by a nearly 500% yearly net income increase alongside a 9.4% profit margin. We all know the story of how Monster became one of the century’s top-performing stocks—but this best-kept Wall Street secret may be on its way to doing the same.\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) A staged room with a blue chair in focus.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThough work-from-home trends are weighing on some Wall Street sectors (like commercial real estate), high-end office furniture manufacturer and best-kept Wall Street secret Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) is flourishing in this new environment. The company’s recent dividend increase affirms this success, offering investors 2.88% yield.\n\nSteelcase quickly rebounded from the post-pandemic supply chain shocks and muted corporate furniture spending. Its latest quarterly earnings report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, a significant increase from the previous year’s figures. Meanwhile, the company has maintained steady sales, hovering around $800 million over the last five quarters, indicating that Steelcase has been enhancing its profit margins without compromising on quality.\n\nThe company is actively adjusting its strategy to fit the work-from-home era, aiming for a 5-7% annual increase in sales and targeting a 5% free cash flow margin relative to revenue over the next five years. Additionally, Steelcase has taken decisive steps to reduce its debt amid rising interest rates, bolstering its liquidity and minimizing interest expenses. This strategic financial management positions Steelcase as one of the best-kept Wall Street secrets today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "In this article, we will examine Wall Street picked these 13 AI stocks for 2024. To see a summary of these stocks, read our article Wall Street Picked These 5 AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nArtificial Intelligence continues to rule the markets and remains the primary factor driving tech stocks to new heights. After causing the stock market to rise in 2023,artificial intelligence remains at the forefront of the media, investors, and even the government. This comes as companies continue assuring investors and the markets at large that they are well-positioned to capture the growth around the revolutionary technology.\n\nLikewise, Wall Street continues to pick AI stocks, given the vast potential for applications of technology in healthcare, finance, and entertainment, among other facets of the economy. Institutional investors and venture capitalists are increasingly investing in emerging AI startups as they look to take advantage of the new frenzy that promises significant returns on investments.\n\nWhile venture investment slowed down in 2023 amid the high-interest rate environment and concerns about recession, that was not the case for the AI sector.

We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive.

(NYSE:CRM) shareholder out of these is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management due to its $3.93 billion stake.\n\nHere is what Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Picked These 5 AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In 12 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off 16 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best edge computing stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the edge computing market, head over to 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhat is Edge Computing?\n\nEdge computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In simple terms, edge computing involves relocating a part of storage and computing capabilities from the central data center to close proximity of data sources. Rather than sending raw data to a central facility for analysis, computation is performed at the location where the data is generated and only the computed results, like real-time business insights or equipment maintenance predictions, are transmitted back to the central data center. Devices such as smart speakers, watches, and phones, which engage in edge computing by locally collecting and processing data, are already a part of our daily lives.\n\nContrary to what some may think, edge computing doesn't need a separate \"edge network.\" It can work on single devices or routers. If a separate network is used, 5G is important, offering fast wireless connections. This enables cool applications like autonomous drones, remote surgeries, and smart cities. The edge network is useful when on-site computing is too expensive or complex, but fast responses are needed, and the cloud is too distant. Edge networks enable local computation, allowing devices at the edge (like sensors, cameras, or IoT devices) to process data and make decisions without the need to send all information to a centralized cloud for analysis.\n\nThe Intelligent Edge aims to provide faster, more reliable, and efficient processing for quicker decision-making and reduced dependence on centralized cloud systems, which may face issues like latency and bandwidth. However, deploying and managing edge computing infrastructures pose challenges due to technological complexity, overwhelming data volume, and interoperability issues. Gartner predicts that by 2026, at least 50% of edge computing deployments will involve machine learning. AI algorithms are well-suited for the data-rich environments of edge computing, enabling quick and accurate analysis of vast data sets. Integrating AI allows edge devices to independently process and act on collected data without constant communication with a central server. This integration enhances decision-making speed, crucial for applications like real-time inventory management or industrial equipment calibration.\n\nStory continues\n\nEdge Computing Market Size and Key Trends\n\nAccording to Expert Market Research, the global edge computing market is anticipated to grow significantly from $15.54 billion in 2023 to $147.38 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.4% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. This growth is attributed to the rise of autonomous vehicles, connected car networks, and the demand for lightweight frameworks and applications to enhance edge computing efficiency, creating numerous market opportunities. PwCexpects the global market for edge data centers to nearly triple, reaching $13.5 billion in 2024 from $4 billion in 2017. This growth is driven by the potential of locally located data centers to reduce latency, address intermittent connections, and enable data storage and computation in close proximity to end-users. Edge data centers are growing in popularity due to several key trends. The introduction of 5G is a big factor, as these smaller decentralized centers support high-density 5G applications with low costs and latency, especially in smart-city scenarios. Similarly, the increasing use of IoT devices requires quick data processing at the edge to handle the growing amount of information from sensors in homes and industries. Moreover, the adoption of software-defined networking and virtualization technologies allows software to replace expensive hardware in data centers. Lastly, the demand for video streaming and AR/VR is met by these cost-effective edge data centers, reducing latency and providing good performance for users.\n\nRead also: Top 15 Edge Computing Companies in the World\n\nWhat’s New in the Edge Computing Market?\n\nOn January 5, 2024, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) disclosed that it is partnering with American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a global digital infrastructure provider, to accelerate the deployment of a hybrid, multi-cloud computing platform at the edge.

People want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”\n\n9.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”\n\n8.

GuardCap Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.74 million shares worth $610.6 million.\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n6. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nArista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) specializes in developing, marketing, and selling data-driven networking solutions for data center and cloud networking, including AI-driven ethernet switching platforms, campus wired and wireless products, and routing systems. The company serves diverse industries such as internet companies, service providers, financial services, government agencies, media, and telecommunications. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) ranks 6th on our list of edge computing market leaders\n\nOn February 12, Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) reported Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.08, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $0.37. The revenue increased 20.3% year-over-year to $1.54 billion, in-line with market consensus.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were bullish on Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 833,408 shares worth $196.2 million.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is one of the notable edge computing market leaders.\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We did a bit of portfolio sculpting during the year, with mixed results. We trimmed Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) several times during the year as it soared. Those trims, a very small one in March at roughly $163 and a larger one in August at $183, don’t look smart with Arista finishing the year at $235 (and up more in January). Arista rose 94% this year. The good news is, Arista finished the year as our second largest holding, at 7.9% of the portfolio.\n\nIf you are wondering how I could sell some Arista at $163 but then hold most of it at $235, the answer is that Arista’s outstanding competitive position in Artificial Intelligence became clearer to me as the year progressed. I felt in March that Arista would earn $8 per share in a few years. I see today that it might earn $8 in 2025.\n\nIt’s possible there is AI-related froth in the Arista stock price, but also probable that Arista will continue to grow rapidly as the computing centers that process AI queries require enormous amounts of data bandwidth. I believe Arista’s routers and switches are the best tools for routing so-called hyperscale traffic. Also, its operating software allows computer giants to manage the kudzu-like growth of their data centers, lowering their total cost of operation.\n\nThe sales of both Arista and Heico reflected my desire to manage PE multiple risk. I keep learning the hard way, however, that trimming your winners generally doesn’t add value. If the valuation is beyond justification, sell the position. If the valuation is high but the business continues to dominate its niche, grow steadily and add value for customers, maybe just take a walk around the block until the urge to sell goes away.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best stocks to buy and hold forever. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nThe equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.\n\nAmong the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a \"Goldilocks\" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.\n\nEd Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26:\n\n\"As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”\n\nTo benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe referred to long-term hedge funds that rarely buy and sell stocks, then found 13 stocks that they have held consistently for at least 10 years. These are the best stocks to buy and hold forever. These hedge funds include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nBest Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever\n\n13. The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nThe Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is a quick-service restaurant company operating in the United States and globally. It operates through three segments – Wendy's U.S., Wendy's International, and Global Real Estate & Development. On February 15, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of March 1. It is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 31.4 million shares worth $613 million. Trian Partners has held a stake in The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) consistently since 2013.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund made the following comment about The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)’s is the second-largest quick-service burger chain in the U.S. This iconic brand generates $13.3 billion of systemwide sales from 7,095 restaurant locations around the world. Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy’s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings. Despite these favorable characteristics, we had an opportunity to purchase shares at ~17x free cash flow, representing a discount to its quick-service restaurant peers as well as private market transactions.”\n\n12. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nMoody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a global risk assessment firm with two main segments – Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service. The company provides institutional risk management, credit research and structured finance solutions, credit ratings, and assessment services for debt obligations and entities. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) declared a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is payable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of February 23. On February 5, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase authority.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 58 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 24.6 million shares worth $9.6 billion.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyze Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”\n\n11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the American multinational beverage giant, is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15. The company’s revenue in Q4 2023 increased 7% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $150 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $23.5 billion.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an integrated payments company operating globally, providing credit cards, charge cards, banking, and related payment and financing products. The company operates through four segments – U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services, International Card Services, and Global Merchant and Network Services. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provided optimistic guidance for 2024, surpassing analyst expectations, despite the Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) and revenue falling short of estimates. American Express plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70, starting from the Q1 declaration. The projected 2024 EPS is between $12.65 and $13.15, exceeding the consensus estimate of $12.30, with an anticipated revenue growth of 9%-11%. This guidance implies a 2024 revenue range of $66.0 billion to $67.2 billion, compared to the consensus of $66.2 billion.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 74 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $28.4 billion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):\n\n“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”\n\n9. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment provides a range of human health products, including oncology, immunology, cardiovascular, and vaccine products. The Animal Health segment focuses on veterinary pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and health management solutions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03 and a revenue of $14.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.14 and $120 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's fourth quarter database, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was part of 98 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 85 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $1.5 billion.\n\nCarillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund made the following comment about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.”\n\n8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading manufacturer and provider of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices. TSMC ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On January 18, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a Q4 GAAP EPADR of $1.44 and a revenue of $19.62 billion, outperforming Wall Street expectations by $0.05 and $50 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 105 hedge funds were long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 107 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 31 million shares worth $3.2 billion.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed in the fourth quarter due to investor expectations for a cyclical recovery in semiconductors heading into 2024 and significant incremental demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company with operations worldwide. It operates through Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. On January 30, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.77, in line with market consensus. The revenue increased 10.7% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $60 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 120 hedge funds were bullish on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 110 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.8 billion.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nJackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.5 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nHorizon Kinetics stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour 13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to Avoid Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here: 3 Stocks to Buy With $1,000",
        "content": "It's safe to say a new bull market is underway. The S&P 500 index is up 25% over the last 12 months and hit new highs to start the year. Because bull markets usually last a lot longer than bear markets, investing in the right growth stocks could pay off over the next five years.\n\nThe most important thing is to invest in solid companies that are almost certain to keep growing for many years due to a competitive advantage or industry tailwind.\n\nIf you have $1,000 sitting around and don't need it for more important things like paying off high-interest debt, here's why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), and Hyatt Hotels(NYSE: H) are great stocks to buy.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon's business is gaining momentum. Revenue growth from its online stores improved in each quarter last year. Since bottoming out, the stock has rallied 84% over the past year, but there is much more upside in store for shareholders as management focuses on reducing costs and boosting the company's profits.\n\nAmazon spent tens of billions of dollars over the last 20 years building a massive footprint of fulfillment infrastructure for its online retail business. Management says it built a transportation network the size of UPS in just 18 months to handle the surge of orders during the pandemic. While this cost a lot of money and sent the company's profits down, it is now starting to reap the benefits of that investment.\n\nAs the old saying goes, stocks follow earnings over the long term. Amazon's operating income (earnings before interest and taxes) skyrocketed 383% year over year in the fourth quarter to more than $13 billion. Head count reductions and slow hiring over the last 12 months have contributed to increased profitability, but management seems eager to trim costs in even more ways.\n\nOn the latest earnings call this month, CEO Andy Jassy said executives see \"meaningful upside\" to lowering the costs to serve customers. This involves getting more efficient in how it locates inventory to speed up delivery, in addition to seeing some of the inflationary costs that hurt many companies in 2022 start to come down.\n\nStory continues\n\nStreet consensus estimates show Amazon growing earnings per share at an annualized rate of 24%. This means if the stock is still trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41 by 2030, investors could see their investment triple in value. Even if the stock's valuation comes down closer to the market average of around 25, that would still leave enough upside to potentially double the value of the shares.\n\n2. Lululemon Athletica\n\nLululemon's growth over the last decade has been stellar, primarily reflecting the resilience of the athletic apparel market.\n\nThe company's annual revenue has more than doubled from pre-pandemic levels, and it continues to grow in line with that trend. Revenue jumped 19% year over year in the quarter ending in October. Increasing demand for athletic wear, which has been on an upward trajectory for decades, and international expansion are the biggest tailwinds supporting Lululemon's rising stock price.\n\nThe athletic wear industry is valued at over $200 billion, according to Statista, and it continues to expand. Lululemon is benefiting from its premium brand positioning and sophisticated online shopping experience.\n\nLululemon is constantly refreshing its assortment to keep demand up, but it also continues to benefit from core styles that have become perennial best-sellers, such as the men's ABC pant and the women's Align. The brand is still in the early innings of growth, as international revenue soared an impressive 49% year over year last quarter.\n\nAnalysts project long-term earnings growth of 16% on an annualized basis. Assuming the company meets those expectations, which are consistent with management's goals, and the stock continues to trade at a forward P/E of 31 -- within its past trading range -- investors can expect to double their money by 2030.\n\n3. Hyatt Hotels\n\nHyatt is the leading brand in the luxury resort market that could deliver excellent returns for shareholders as travel demand continues to increase. In fact, the travel industry is expected to grow to over $1 trillion by 2027, according to Statista.\n\nThe key to appreciating Hyatt as a wonderful investment lies in how it generates revenue. While the hotel-chain gets some sales from owned hotels and room rentals, it primarily makes money from fee-based revenue, licensing, and other services. Hyatt sells third-party owners and franchisees the right to use Hyatt's intellectual property. This strategy lends itself to a profitable business that, when combined with a growing industry tailwind, drives shareholder returns.\n\nHyatt's free cash flow has more than doubled since 2017, and management continues to redirect those resources into expanding the number of rooms available in order to increase revenue. It has led the industry in net room growth over the last six years, and management sees more opportunities to enter new markets to expand further.\n\nOne opportunity is the Asia-Pacific region. Revenue-generating fees in this region soared 51% year over year in the fourth quarter. Hyatt also announced an agreement with the Hangzhou Trade and Tourism Group to develop over 60 hotels in China.\n\nAnalysts expect Hyatt to increase earnings by 10% on an annualized basis. Management is making moves to boost the percentage of profits coming from high-margin fees, including selling owned hotels to reinvest in more profitable areas of the company. These decisions should continue to drive attractive returns for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best AI to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an \"AI cold shower,\" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.\n\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.\n\nOn February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have. JPMorgan has internally explored the use of these technologies, with Dimon foreseeing AI playing a role in almost every job. JPMorgan has dedicated resources, including a chief data and analytics officer, for AI-related initiatives, with around 200 employees actively researching large language models. Dimon, while acknowledging potential misuse, expressed optimism about AI's positive contributions, citing cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research as areas where it can be particularly beneficial.\n\nSome of the best AI ETFs offer investors exposure to stocks like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NYSE:S) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity software company that specializes in endpoint protection, cloud security, and security data analytics. Shares rose on outstanding quarterly financial results and strong guidance. SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year. Growth has been driven by a combination of: 1) market share capture from legacy endpoint vendors that struggle to compete against SentinelOne’s AI-enabled platform; 2) an ongoing shift of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to the cloud driving demand for cloud application protection (growing triple digits); and 3) cybersecurity vendor consolidation favoring end-to-end platforms with comprehensive security portfolios over single-point solutions. The company is also leveraging its single data store and AI capabilities to cross-sell more products into its existing customer base and increase average sale prices. Between larger deal sizes and improving operating efficiencies, we believe the company can continue to expand margins at a significant rate and begin generating positive free cash flow in the next fiscal year.”\n\n11. Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSE:ROBO)\n\nYTD Share Price Gain as of March 8: 6.45%\n\nRobo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSE:ROBO) invests in global companies leading advancements in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this?

But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 2024 12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: Here Are My Top 5 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Since stocks began trading on the Nasdaq roughly 50 years ago, the index has only produced negative annual returns 14 times. Over the last 20 years, the index has dropped by at least 30% on three occasions: 2002, 2008, and 2022.\n\nInterestingly, following the precipitous declines of 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq rallied for consecutive years thereafter. Between 2003 and 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 16% per year. And in 2009 and 2010, the index produced average returns of 30%.\n\nAfter its painful performance in 2022, the Nasdaq rebounded sharply in 2023, returning 43%. It's safe to say that the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) largely influenced the upswing in tech stocks.\n\nBut 2024 is off to a red-hot start, and further gains could be in store for investors. While each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks below experienced AI-driven momentum last year, I think all of them still look enticing at the moment.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is best known for its e-commerce and cloud computing operations. The last few years have been brutal for Amazon. Unusually high inflation coupled with the rising interest rates that reined in that inflation have squeezed Amazon's core businesses. Consumers have scaled back their discretionary spending, putting a strain on Amazon's e-commerce efforts. In addition, as companies tightened their budgets, its software businesses witnessed a pronounced growth deceleration. This dynamic can be seen in the ebbs and flows of Amazon's revenue and free cash flow generation below. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut throughout 2023, Amazon made a series of savvy moves that could help reignite its growth. Among them, the company invested billions into OpenAI competitor Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be training future generative AI models on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nInvestors should not overlook the impact AI can have on Amazon. The technology should not only help fuel some renewed interest in AWS, but also integrate into Amazon's e-commerce, streaming, logistics, and advertising businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.1 looks like a bargain compared to its historical levels. Now could be a great opportunity to scoop up shares of this under-the-radar AI player.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) kicked off the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. Since pouring billions into the start-up, Microsoft has swiftly integrated ChatGPT across the Windows operating system.\n\nSimilar to Amazon, Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carries some of the most lucrative growth prospects for the company as it relates to AI. The one concern I have about Microsoft is its valuation. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35.5, Microsoft trades at a premium compared to most of its Magnificent Seven peers. While it's reasonable to believe that the expected impacts of AI are baked into Microsoft's price, perhaps more than some of its peers, I don't think the stock is egregiously overvalued.\n\nClearly, investors are placing a premium on the biggest names in AI -- and Microsoft is no exception. Given that AI is in its early innings, I see Microsoft as well-positioned to dominate in the long run. Despite its premium valuation, now could still be a good time to use dollar-cost averaging to add some shares to your portfolio.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) owns two of the world's most visited websites: Google and YouTube. Given Alphabet's commanding surface area on the Internet, it's not a surprise to learn that advertisers are keen to be seen on its platforms.\n\nBut although advertising has long been Alphabet's primary revenue and profit machine, the company is in the midst of an identity crisis. Social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook have become increasingly popular over the last few years -- especially among highly coveted demographics, including Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAs such, growth in Alphabet's advertising business has started to plateau, investor enthusiasm is starting to wane, and Alphabet stock is taking a hit. On a price-to-sales basis, Alphabet is the second cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nNevertheless, I still see many reasons to own Alphabet stock. First, the company is quickly gaining momentum in the cloud computing landscape. What's even better is that its cloud segment is generating positive operating income on a consistent basis, mitigating some of the deceleration in the core advertising business.\n\nMoreover, the cloud is really where Alphabet is focusing its artificial intelligence efforts. So, even though the advertising business is currently facing some challenges, investors can actually buy Alphabet's AI business at a pretty steep discount.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) owns social media apps Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Additionally, the company has a budding metaverse operation via its virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) hardware products.\n\nThe last couple of years have been tough for Meta, however. The company pivoted to an all-in approach to the metaverse a couple of years ago. While this was initially met with praise, investors quickly soured on the company after a series of poor earnings reports that featured decelerating growth in the core advertising business and mounting losses.\n\nMeta spent much of 2023 turning things around and shifting its focus back to its bread-and-butter businesses. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith sales and free cash flow on the rise, Meta appears to have climbed its way out of a hole. What's even better is that in the wake of this newfound growth, Meta has found ample ways to reward shareholders. Following its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this year, Meta announced a $50 billion share repurchase and the initiation of a quarterly dividend.\n\nGiven that artificial intelligence can significantly impact both Meta's advertising and metaverse businesses, the long-term ride could just be getting started for the social media conglomerate.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nLast on the list is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a developer of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Make no mistake about it -- the AI narrative largely hinges on Nvidia. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are in high demand as generative AI takes the world by storm.\n\nThe most lucrative thing about Nvidia is that AI touches nearly every aspect of its business -- from data centers to software development and more. What I find most attractive about Nvidia is that it's aggressively deploying its ever-growing profits. The company recently invested in two budding areas of AI: voice-recognition software and robotics. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nWhile the company's market cap has grown by $1 trillion in less than a year, I think the momentum can easily continue. Considering that its outlook is robust for the next several years, Nvidia's valuation seems warranted. Now could be a great time to buy some shares to hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Exclusive: The FTC is probing Amazon’s new controversial fees in its $140 billion seller business",
        "content": "The Federal Trade Commission has begun examining a new set of fees Amazon has recently levied on U.S. merchants selling goods through its online megastore, according to multiple sources familiar with the development. The agency’s interest comes in the wake of Fortune’s report last week that found many longtime Amazon sellers are furious about the fees.\n\nOne new fee requires sellers to either pay for a new Amazon warehousing service or begin shipping goods to at least four different warehouses on their own dime to avoid the fee. Another penalizes sellers if their inventory in Amazon warehouses consistently runs too low, unless they sign up for the same new Amazon warehousing service.\n\nSometime after the article was published, FTC staff began reaching out to Amazon sellers to learn more about the impact of the fees, according to multiple sources. It’s unclear how many sellers have been contacted. It’s also not yet clear what the exact goal of the inquiries is, but the FTC last year filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon that included claims of Amazon abusing its power over these sellers. Amazon is fighting the suit.\n\nFTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar declined to comment.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Mira Dix told Fortune that the new fee changes “allow sellers to choose where they want to have Amazon take on different aspects of fulfillment and where they want to do the work themselves. On average, the 2024 fee changes are significantly less than those announced by other major fulfillment services, and many sellers will see a decrease in the average fees paid to Amazon per unit sold.”\n\nNone of the half dozen sellers Fortune spoke to last week expected their costs to decrease as a result of the changes, however.\n\nAmazon first announced these fees and other seller fee changes in December, and said they were designed to increase shipping speeds for Amazon customers, while reducing the costs of such initiatives. But a half dozen top Amazon sellers told Fortune last week that the new fees are overly complex and expensive, and may force them to cede more control of their supply chain to the tech giant or raise prices for consumers buying their goods on Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new fees apply to the majority of the hundreds of thousands of small and midsize businesses that sell goods on Amazon in the U.S., and that already pay Amazon to store and ship goods on their behalf through a program known as FBA, or Fulfillment by Amazon. FBA is the easiest way for sellers to guarantee that their goods carry the crucial Amazon Prime badge and are available for fast delivery.\n\nAmazon sellers accounted for more than 60% of items sold on the company’s shopping sites during the holiday quarter, with the tech giant generating $140 billion in revenue from seller fees alone in 2023.\n\nLast week, Amazon sellers told Fortune that at least one of the new fees—called “the inbound placement service fee”—appears designed to pressure merchants to utilize another Amazon warehousing service in addition to FBA, called AWD, or Amazon Warehousing and Distribution. The idea of AWD is to replace warehouses where Amazon sellers store their long-term inventory before they are shipped to Amazon’s FBA warehouses or fulfillment centers to be packed into customer orders.\n\nSome of the business owners who spoke to Fortune also said that this new “placement fee,” coupled with another that Amazon will soon charge for low-inventory levels, will force them to pass on price increases to Amazon customers.\n\n“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to sell on Amazon,” Albert Grazi, a highly rated Amazon seller of seven years who sells around $5 million in water filtration products on Amazon annually, told Fortune last week. “You are getting squeezed from all sides.”\n\nIn the days since the original Fortune report, the new fees have sparked impassioned discussions among sellers on LinkedIn, the popular wallstreetbets subreddit, as well as Amazon’s own seller-focused message board. Some sellers have appeared blindsided by the news, while others have been sharing advice on potential workarounds. One involves applying for Merchant Fulfilled Prime, which allows a seller to store and ship their products on their own and still earn the Prime badge if they can hit a strict threshold of delivery performance.\n\nBeyond the new inbound placement fees, on April 1 Amazon will also begin charging most sellers a fee if they don’t consistently have four weeks of inventory in Amazon fulfillment centers. One problem, sellers told Fortune, is that Amazon also charges sellers for storing too much inventory in Amazon facilities.\n\n“You gotta precisely thread the needle to not get completely killed,” Judah Bergman, the CEO of a major Amazon seller called Jool Baby, said last week of the low-inventory charges.\n\nHowever, sellers can avoid the low-inventory fees by handing Amazon more control of their supply chain and utilizing the AWD service for long-term inventory storage.\n\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Slashed His Position in Nvidia. Here Are the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "David Tepper amassed a fortune of $20.6 billion by making plenty of smart decisions. Some investors will probably question one of his recent decisions, though. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper sold nearly 23% of his Appaloosa Management hedge fund's position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIn retrospect, that doesn't appear to be a great move. Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed more than 70% so far in 2024. However, Tepper remains heavily invested in the GPU maker. Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding. He's also still very bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). Here are four AI stocks the billionaire investor bought in Q4.\n\n1. Oracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) ranks as Tepper's biggest new position in Q4. He bought 1.32 million shares of the database and software giant that were worth close to $140 million at the end of 2023.\n\nSince then, Oracle's shares have risen by a single-digit percentage. The company hasn't had any major news to provide a catalyst yet in 2024. That could soon change: Oracle is scheduled to announce its fiscal 2024 third-quarter results on March 11.\n\nIn the meantime, Oracle has been busy bolstering its AI credentials. The company launched its new Oracle cloud infrastructure generative AI service in January. This new service enables Oracle's cloud platform customers to build generative AI apps using large language models from Cohere and Meta Platforms. Oracle is also a major partner with Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service.\n\n2. Alibaba\n\nTepper also loaded up on Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) in Q4. His hedge fund already owned a sizable position in the Chinese tech stock but added another 750,000 shares. That was enough to boost Appaloosa's stake in Alibaba by nearly 21%.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Tepper might like Alibaba right now. The stock is down more than 20% over the last 12 months due in large part to sluggish growth in China. This decline, though, has made Alibaba cheaper than it's been in quite a while with a forward earnings multiple of only 8.1 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba has reportedly placed big orders for Nvidia's chips to use with its cloud platform. However, it can't deploy the most advanced GPUs because of U.S. restrictions on exports of AI technology to China.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) retained its No. 3 spot in Appaloosa Management's portfolio at the end of 2023. But it was a bigger position for the hedge fund after Tepper increased his stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant by more than 5.3%. That has turned out to be a great move, with Amazon stock jumping by a double-digit percentage so far in 2024.\n\nWhy does Tepper like Amazon? I suspect two reasons especially stand out. First, the company's profitability and free cash flow are growing robustly. Second, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform should have tremendous growth prospects fueled by the adoption of generative AI.\n\nAs was the case with Oracle and Alibaba, Amazon also has a tight connection with Nvidia. AWS has used Nvidia's GPUs for years. But Amazon is also at least somewhat of a rival to Nvidia as well. The company has developed its own Trainium and Inferentia AI chips that AWS customers can use with their AI apps.\n\n4. Microsoft\n\nTepper also increased his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) by nearly 4% in Q4. The massive tech company currently ranks as Appaloosa Management's second-largest holding, making up 11.3% of its portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft has been another solid winner so far this year. AI continues to serve as a major growth driver for the company, which has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its products.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Microsoft is yet another key partner with Nvidia. Among other things, the two companies are working together to connect Nvidia's AI Enterprise software with Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning platform. Like Amazon, though, Microsoft has also developed its own AI chips that could help it reduce its dependence on Nvidia.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "11 Best Alternatives to Aquaphor and Petroleum Jelly",
        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 11 Best Alternatives to Aquaphor and Petroleum Jelly. You can skip our detailed analysis of the global skincare market, beauty and sustainability come together, and skincare companies are developing and using eco-friendly practices, go directly to the 5 Best Alternatives to Aquaphor and Petroleum Jelly.\n\nThe ultimate form of self-care, skincare, consists of a variety of treatments and products intended to improve and maintain the condition of our skin. Skincare enables us to reveal a bright and youthful complexion by doing everything from cleaning and hydrating to protecting and renewing. This art form allows us to embrace our natural brightness and take the first steps toward having healthy, glowing skin by harmoniously fusing science and beauty. Let skincare serve as the cornerstone of your radiant and loving self!\n\nThe size of the US skincare market was estimated at $26.78 billion in 2023 and is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% to reach $50.27 billion by 2030 as per Verified Market Research.\n\nGlobal Skincare Market:\n\nAccording toGrand View Research, the global skincare products market size wasvalued at $135.83 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to boom between 2023 and 2030 at a CAGR of 4.7%. Global demand for body lotions, sunscreens, and face creams is predicted to have a beneficial effect on growth. Furthermore, it is expected that the thriving e-commerce industry will spur additional market expansion. The beauty and cosmetics business was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strict lockdown procedures caused store closures, which had severe effects. Global sales fell by 60–70% between March and April 2020. As consumers reduced their spending on cosmetics and grooming items, corporations positively addressed the situation by stepping up production and providing hand sanitizers and cleaning agents. The impact of viral content makers and the rise of organic skin care trends have significantly expanded the market for skin care products. Due to the influence of well-known personalities and the growing need for high-quality skin care products, the rise of celebrity-led brands like Kylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner is surging global demand for skin care.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe desire of consumers for personalized items has been rising in the United States. With a revenue share of 39.65% in 2022, Asia-Pacific was the dominant region worldwide. From 2023 to 2030, North America's CAGR is projected to be 4.4%. Customers in North American nations like the United States and Canada are prepared to shell out money in exchange for skin that is more radiant and youthful-looking. In 2022, face creams and moisturizers had the highest revenue share (42.11%), and this trend is anticipated to continue throughout the forecast period.\n\nBeauty and Sustainability Come Together:\n\nThe skincare sector is currently going through a profound transformation. The perception of sustainable beauty is unexpectedly gaining traction, fueled by the aspiration for merchandise that no longer only enhances our look but also undoubtedly contributes to the well-being of our planet. This remarkable movement is reshaping the beauty market, challenging conventional practices, and igniting a surge of creativity and ingenuity. From the utilization of eco-friendly ingredients to the adoption of sustainable packaging and the emergence of consumer traits, sustainable beauty is the way towards an environmentally conscious destiny.\n\nThe vegan cosmetics market, predicted to be worth $17.39 billion globally in 2022, is anticipated to rise at a thrilling rate and attain $24 billion by 2028, as reported by Research and Markets. Europe is expected to be valued at $2.2 billion by 2028, making it a crucial geographic area for this marketplace. Hence, customers are actively seeking out beauty merchandise that might be vegan, cruelty-free, or composed of natural materials. With Green Beauty, purchasers can use their purchases to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and ethics.\n\nFor years, petroleum jelly has been used as a moisturizer and skin healer. The latter is a product of crude oil. One of the best-selling products, Aquaphor, consists of mineral oil, which is extracted from petroleum. However, recently, concerns have been raised about petroleum jelly's sustainability, effectiveness, and safety.\n\nEven the more refined and pure forms of mineral oil cannot be metabolized by the body, according to a 2011 study. Consequently, they do not get eliminated but rather build up in our bodies over time.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group claims that 1,4dioxane, a carcinogenic contaminant, is present in 22% of all petroleum-based cosmetics. As recognized endocrine disruptors and xenoestrogens, petroleum-based products have the potential to cause estrogen dominance, according to studies.\n\nAs the skincare market is currently changing and there is a wealth of information available about various substances, customers are becoming more aware of the effects that personal care products have on the environment and their health. As a result, researchers and cosmetic chemists are looking into a range of natural and synthetic ingredients to mimic the occlusive, protective properties of petroleum jelly while offering other skin benefits. The majority of clean beauty shops and establishments, like Whole Foods, forbid the use of petroleum and mineral oil constituents in their products.\n\nThe American international grocery chain Whole Foods Market, Inc., a division of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), is based in Austin, Texas, and offers products free of artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives as well as hydrogenated fats. In 2017, Whole Foods Market was acquired by  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a sum of $13.7 billion.\n\nThe American multinational corporation and technology company Amazon.com, Inc., doing business as  Amazon, is focused on digital streaming, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, online marketing, and e-commerce. Individuals purchase goods online from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which offers several non-petroleum alternatives. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) generated a staggering $513.98 billion in revenue in 2022.\n\nSkincare Companies Are Developing and Using Eco-Friendly Practices:\n\nWith a focus on packaging, forestry, water, and climate change, Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) with a whopping revenue of $80.19 billion in 2022, is a globally renowned US brand dedicated to making a positive difference in our homes, communities, and the environment.\n\nProcter & Gamble Company’s (NYSE:PG) is well-acquainted with acquiring beauty brands. In 2022, the corporation allocated $1.4 billion in cash for acquisitions, primarily focusing on popular and clean skincare brands Farmacy Beauty and Tula, along with haircare company Ouai.\n\nProcter & Gamble Company’s (NYSE:PG) goal is to create products and innovations that, when combined, provide sustainable, unbeatable supremacy. According to Procter & Gamble Company’s (NYSE:PG) Annual Citizenship Report 2022, the company, by 2040, aims to attain net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout its supply chain, from raw materials to retailers.\n\nEstée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a global cosmetics American brand, has taken a step towards boosting its commitment to sustainable packaging in 2023 by teaming with SK Chemicals, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chemical and life science products.\n\nAs stated by the latter company, advanced recycling “is considered important technology for the advancement of packaging-to-packaging recycling, helping solve plastic waste issues in a circular and innovative way.”\n\nEstée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) announced several ambitious targets for sustainability in 2021. Two of these objectives were to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum plastic used in packaging to 50% or less by 2030 and to incorporate 25% post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials into the packaging by 2025. Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) hopes to accomplish the aforementioned goals with the assistance of SK Chemicals.\n\nAfter completing a $2.8 billion agreement in April 2023, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) became the only owner of the Tom Ford brand. In the high-end beauty industry, it is one of the biggest deals.\n\nWith that said, here are the 11 Best Alternatives to Aquaphor and Petroleum Jelly. 11 Best Alternatives to Aquaphor and Petroleum Jelly\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo pick out the 11 Best Alternatives to Aquaphor and Petroleum Jelly, we have used a consensus-based approachusing a diverse variety of credible sources to determine the best non-petroleum products worldwide.

        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development. If you want to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development.\n\nGlobal R&D Outlook\n\nAccording to the R&D report by AAAS, global investments in research and development have witnessed a significant surge over the past 20 years. The global R&D investments tripled from $672 billion in 1992 to more than $2.2 trillion by 2021. However, the aftermath of the pandemic hindered this growth, with a decline in annual increases to less than 2% in 2020 and 2021, compared to 3.6% in the last decade. Although there are reporting limitations from China to quantify its data, it is evident that it is the largest contributor to non-OECD investments. OECD countries are continuously increasing their R&D spending. In 2021, the R&D investments by OECD countries reached 2.71%. The business sector is the key driver of these investments, accounting for over 60% of R&D investments in 2020. The R&D intensity of the US surpassed 3% in 2019 after ranging between 2.5% to 3% for over two decades. South Korea and China also experienced substantial growth over the past decade, with their R&D spending surging from 2.1% to 4.6% and from 0.9% to 2.2%, respectively. Germany's research and development spending also reached 3.2% in 2019.\n\nGlobal Tech Investments\n\nThe strong research and development portfolio of countries globally reflects directly on the pace of technological advancements in today's world. With the growing digital and tech adoption, the world is continuously advancing toward key technology trends such as AI, cloud computing, quantum science, and edge computing. The workforce in the tech sector is a major driver of the growth of the tech sector. Tech-related fields experienced a 15% rise between 2021 and 2022. Nearly 1 million job postings were publicized by applied AI and next-generation software development between 2018 and 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn March 5, Reuters reported that China outlined plans to strengthen its self-sufficiency in the tech sector. The country aims to focus on emerging trends such as quantum computing and AI. This plan is a result of the current trade tensions with the US. China will introduce major science and technology programs and utilize its political systems to integrate capabilities and reduce dependency on foreign suppliers. Moreover, it plans to develop a robust pool of researchers and innovators to fuel domestic advancements across various tech domains.\n\nSome of the most technologically advanced countries such as the US, China, and South Korea are also actively investing in AI. According to research from Bloomberg Intelligence, the global AI market is anticipated to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. PwC estimates that AI could lead to a staggering contribution of $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Additionally, AI is expected to fuel an increase of 26% in the GDP of local economies by 2030. The United States is leading the ongoing AI  race with the highest number of AI startups. For instance, Anthropic is a leading AI startup in the US, backed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On March 4, Reuters reported that the Silicon Valley startup, Anthropic released its latest suite of AI models, Claude 3. The model claims to outshine competitors such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Gemini 1.0 Ultra. The Claude 3 Opus will be ideal when dealing with complex tasks such as financial analysis.\n\nCompanies Driving Innovation in the Tech Sector\n\nSome of the top companies driving innovation in the tech sector include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOn January 19, the global tech leader, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that AWS will be making a significant investment of 2.26 trillion yen into its cloud infrastructure in Japan by 2027. This investment will contribute to the rising demand for cloud services in the country and also add to Japan's digital transformation.  Moreover, the project will induce a positive economic impact, supporting jobs and fueling GDP.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading tech company, specializing in robotics, AI, HPC, and autonomous vehicle technology. On February 6, the company announced that it had allied with digital communications technology company, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to provide robust and manageable AI infrastructure solutions to businesses. The partnership aims to manage the growing demand for secure and efficient tools to deploy AI at scale. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will leverage Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) networking capabilities to offer a diverse suite of solutions. It will also integrate its GPUs into Cisco servers, granting access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. Moreover, Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) AI-assisted management and monitoring tools will facilitate infrastructure operations.\n\nOn February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched the next generation of its large language model, Gemini 1.5 with significant improvements compared to its predecessors. The new model will deliver improved performance and will have a novel MoE architecture enhancing its efficiency. The Gemini 1.5 will be capable of processing up to 1 million tokens. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has initially released the language model with a standard context window of 128,000 tokens, with restricted access to 1 million tokens through an early access program.\n\nNow, let's have a look at the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development. 20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development\n\n20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development, we utilized the R&D Expenditure as a percentage of GDP data from the World Bank.

        "title": "13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\nAccording to the Migration Data Portal in 2022, the number of international migrant workers has steadily increased over the years, reaching 169 million by 2019. Of this total, 58.5% are male, while 41.5% are female. Women, in particular, are often employed in low-paid and low-skilled jobs. One of the most common reasons for immigration is the limited job opportunities in the labor market. Many people relocate to developed nations in pursuit of a better quality of life, seeking improved and higher-paying jobs, even in cases of lower education and no special skills.\n\nUnskilled Worker Immigration-- Potential for Economic Growth\n\nLow-skilled or unskilled labor/workers are typically defined as individuals employed in jobs that require little or no experience or training, often involving routine tasks. However, their role in the economy should not be underestimated. Many companies value unskilled labor as it constitutes a significant portion of their workforce. The immigration of unskilled or low-skilled workers also has far-reaching implications globally. While the increase in international migration has been associated with higher economic gains for the global GDP, ranging from 20% to 60%, unskilled immigration itself can contribute to elevated labor productivity and GDP per capita in host countries. The resulting gains can be distributed across populations in both immigrant and emigrant countries.\n\nUnskilled Immigration-- A Contentious Issue\n\nWhile immigration remains a politically contentious issue in the US, opinions on encouraging skilled and discouraging unskilled immigrants are also sharply divided. Some, particularly economists, advocate for a more lenient policy towards unskilled labor, contrasting with those who argue that such individuals may displace native workers. A recent study on the US low-skill work visa lottery supports the economists' perspective, revealing that firms forced to reduce their foreign low-skill hires by half experienced an 18% decrease in production and did not increase native hiring either.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for Unskilled Immigrants in the US\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that large organizations persist in hiring unskilled or low-skilled immigrants aspiring to obtain citizenship in developed countries like the US. These companies span various industries, including hotel chains like Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR), fast-food giants like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), and even tech conglomerates like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG).\n\nOne method is the EB-3 Unskilled Visa Program, allowing low-skilled immigrants to replace Americans who are unwilling to take entry-level jobs on a permanent full-time basis, with the desire to gain US citizenship. The Congress has allocated approximately 10,000 visas annually for such jobs. The food sector, in particular, offers multiple low-skill level jobs (entry level) continuously filled by immigrants through the EB-3 Unskilled Visa program. Companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), for instance, utilize this program to hire foreign workers. Currently, 72 US McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE: MCD) franchises are participating in this program, resulting in 3,200 employees obtaining their green cards.\n\nEB-3 visas have also proven successful for tech companies such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), 3M Company (NYSE: MMM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These companies have utilized the program to fill positions during periods of domestic labor shortages since the 1990s. 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to\n\n13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to, we referenced our article on the 20 Countries with the Highest Minimum Wage in the World as a starting point. This preliminary list was designed to identify countries beneficial for unskilled workers in terms of income. We then utilized the Labor Market Mobility score from the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020 to rank these countries in ascending order. Additionally, as a tie-breaker in case of similar rankings, we considered the foreign-born employment rates for low-skilled jobs sourced from the OECD's Settling In 2018 Indicators of Immigrant Integration.\n\nNote: The foreign-born employment rates for low-skilled jobs for the United States were not available in the report due to the fact that the country does not make a distinction between low-skilled and medium-skilled jobs. Information for Canada was also not available in the document.\n\nThe minimum wage rate is calculated on the basis of the exchange rate and therefore, is subject to change.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet us now move to our list of 13 Countries for Unskilled Workers to Immigrate to.\n\n13. Israel\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nWith a robust minimum wage policy standing at $8.57 per hour, Israel stands out as a compelling option for the unskilled labor force seeking an improved quality of life, especially considering the expected further increase in the minimum wage this year. Recently, the Israeli government implemented a more lenient unskilled labor hiring policy. This change, aimed at addressing labor shortages in the country, permits industrial companies to now recruit unskilled laborfrom previously unauthorized countries, including nations like India and Sri Lanka.\n\nFor immigrants seeking better job opportunities, particularly from emerging or developing nations, Israel emerges as a promising choice. The labor market mobility score indicates a moderately favorable environment, granting immigrants immediate access to the job market, albeit under less favorable conditions than those for nationals. The employment rate for foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs in the country is 8.5%, compared to 5.7% for native-born individuals. This suggests that immigrants are more likely to secure low-skilled jobs making Israel an attractive destination for unskilled workers seeking opportunities.\n\n12. Lithuania\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nLithuania is another country offering a competitive minimum wage of $6.16 per hour to its residents. With an economy centered around finance, tourism, and luxury goods, Lithuania presents numerous job opportunities. Popular positions for foreigners without a degree include roles such as event staff, recreational attendant, hotel bellhop/porter, and more.\n\nSimilar to Israel, Lithuania offers a somewhat favorable situation for immigrants in the labor market. While most immigrants can readily access the job market, they may encounter challenges in finding opportunities for skill advancement or vocational education. Nevertheless, given the higher percentage of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs compared to native-born residents, the country presents a potential opportunity for unskilled immigrants to secure a place in the labor market.\n\n11. France\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 52\n\nAs an advanced economy, France offers a globally competitive minimum wage of $12.35 per hour. Unskilled workers can find a range of job opportunities in the service sector, including restaurants, bars, and hotels. The thriving tourism industry also presents ample possibilities for individuals without specific skills or experience. Additionally, those with proficiency in English can explore employment opportunities in call centers or as nannies.\n\nFrance's labor market mobility score indicates a favorable environment for immigrants, making it relatively easy for them to find jobs, with some restrictions in more regulated job sectors. However, similar to the previously mentioned countries, accessing training and skill education may pose challenges for immigrants. The country predominantly offers low-skilled jobs to immigrants, evident in the disparity between foreign-born (18.7%) and native-born (9.2%) employment rates in low-skilled positions.\n\n10. Belgium\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 56\n\nAs a developed European country offering its residents numerous benefits, including a high minimum wage, Belgium stands out as a potential destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. With a minimum wage per hour at $12.94, Belgium provides opportunities for individuals desiring to move to the country and secure employment. Various unskilled jobs are available, ranging from positions in food service to construction labor and house cleaning, among others.\n\nThe labor market mobility for newcomers in Belgium is reasonably favorable, allowing non-EU immigrants access to public employment and training opportunities, albeit with some delays. Notably, a significant proportion of low-skilled jobs in the country (21.6%) are filled by foreign-born individuals, surpassing the native-born employment rate of 8.7%. Consequently, Belgium emerges as a viable option for unskilled immigrants seeking job opportunities and a place to settle down.\n\n9. New Zealand\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nEffective from April 1, 2024, the minimum wage in New Zealand is expected to be set at $14.12 per hour. While the country, like many others, is streamlining rules to attract skilled labor, there are ample opportunities for unskilled workers as well. Various industries, including hospitality, manufacturing, retail, supermarkets, and construction, actively employ a significant number of unskilled workers. Immigrants entering the country on job visas in these sectors can not only enjoy competitive salaries in this developed nation but also access many other associated benefits.\n\nWhile new immigrants in New Zealand may experience some delays in complete labor market integration, the labor market mobility score indicates that they can still access the market and benefit from targeted support. Notably, 9.2% of foreign-born residents in New Zealand are employed in low-skilled jobs, showcasing opportunities for newcomers to participate in the workforce.\n\n8. Japan\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nJapan, as a developed nation with a robust economy and a relatively high minimum wage set at $7.46 per hour since October 1, 2023, has undergone significant changes in its immigration policies. In late 2018, the country revised its immigration laws to attract both low-skilled and high-skilled workers to address labor shortages in specific sectors. From April 2019, this initiative aimed to encourage the immigration of 350,000 new individuals—comprising both types of workers—over a consecutive five-year period. Additionally, the country's growth in the agriculture and construction sectors has led to increased employment opportunities for low/unskilled workers.\n\nJapanese immigrant integration policies prioritize equal treatment for permanent residents alongside other citizens. Temporary workers are also granted the opportunity to secure basic subordinate-level jobs. The foreign-born rate of employment in low-skilled jobs is notably higher at 12.5%, compared to the native-born rate of 9%, indicating increased opportunities for unskilled workers to find employment in low-skilled roles within the country.\n\n7. Netherlands\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nAs one of the strongest economies in Europe, the Netherlands emerges as a promising destination for unskilled workers seeking immigration. The country offers a wealth of diverse job opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, retail, and food service. Notably, the Netherlands provides a highly competitive minimum wage of $14.46 per hour.\n\nThe Netherlands also secures a place in the slightly favorable category of the MIPEX integration index, indicating the ease with which new non-EU migrants can find employment in both public and private sectors. Long-term migrants and families staying in the country also enjoy equal access to education, training, and study grants. Additionally, the proportion of foreign-born individuals in low-skilled jobs surpasses that of the native-born population (15.2% compared to 8.2%), underscoring increased opportunities for unskilled individuals to secure these positions.\n\n6. South Korea\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nSouth Korea stands among the nations with a high minimum wage, currently set at $7.40 per hour as of January 1, 2024. The Korean government actively promotes the influx of low-skilled foreign workers into the country, particularly in sectors such as hospitality, mining, and forestry. The goal is to attract and integrate 165,000 new immigrants into these industries.\n\nSouth Korea's labor market mobility score suggests a generally favorable attitude toward immigrants, with long-term residents enjoying easy access to self-employment, public jobs, and general and targeted support.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best hot stocks to buy for March. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is dominated by one key theme. If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half.\n\nThis surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively.\n\nYet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) merits a mention. Goldman was one of the few voices on Wall Street that bucked the trend in late 2022 and argued that avoiding a recession might be avoidable despite rapid central bank interest rate hikes. Now, the bank shares that during the week that ended on February 2023, hedge funds sold technology stocks at some of the highest rates for the past five years. It believes that software stocks were among the biggest losers, while bullish bets such as call options for NVIDIA's shares remain in play and suggest a hesitancy to completely go against technology stocks.\n\nSo, with Q1 2024 shaping up to be quite interesting, we decided to take a look at some hot stocks to buy. A couple of these are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

We set out with three key goals, secure FDA clearances, achieve adjusted EBITDA near breakeven exiting 2023 and revitalize our channel health. I'm incredibly pleased to announce that we achieved all three. These accomplishments are a testament to our team's dedication, the strength of our product portfolio and a large community of parents, health professionals and partners that believe deeply in the importance and mission of outlet. Most importantly, though, these achievements position outlet for substantial growth in 2024.\r\n Now let me talk about each. Our recent FDA clearance was a pivotal moment for the business and by launching babies that Andreas talk with medical-grade features. We redefined consumer health monitoring and redesign the market for Alex, let me explain why this is so significant. First, it removes purchasing obstacles, FDA clearance, address the key customer concerns around regulatory status and the efficacy of our products and firmly specifically for Dream SoC. We added features such as live vital sign displays and helpful are giving medical-grade comfort to parents wishing to monitor and protect their children. I'm excited to report that parents responded in kind in Q4 as evidenced by the doubling of our sell through during the recent holiday period and our dream SoC sell-through has continued to maintain double digit growth over prior periods.\r\n Second, it solidifies our market leadership. It is now the first and only FDA-cleared baby monitor in its category selling us apart from competitors to our basic consumer products and further distinguishing our category from traditional sound and video monitors also allowing us to drive direct comparisons to trusted hospital grade technology.\r\n Third, it opened the market for medical expansion. These clearances pave the way for our baby SAP product to enter healthcare distribution, allowing us to improve the standard of care of monitoring for high-risk babies. It also allows pediatricians to prescribe outlet instead of the traditional intrusive and clunky hospital monitoring solutions that increase risk with wires going into the crib. These new channels increase our distribution strength in our Consumer and Medical brand and improved margins alongside our FDA success, we've dramatically improved financial efficiency through a combination of strategic actions since the launch of Dream sock in 2022, we reduced operating expenses by nearly 60%, including consolidating vendors and eliminating unnecessary costs. Over the same timeframe, we significantly reduced marketing expenses by over 70% and we've been able to effectively maintain those marketing spend levels while still driving a 20% increase in sell-through in 2023. This was done by focusing on targeted channels on social media, specific partnerships, product satisfaction initiative and leveraging our credibility behind our FDA clearances. Our marketing chief team drove over 100 million unique video views and increased our social media falling to 1.3 million pair seltzer growth in 2023 and significant year-over-year improvement. Post-fda clearance demonstrates that we can grow without significantly increasing marketing expense. We also improved gross margins to 47% in Q4, a 1,900 basis point improvement year over year and would have delivered over 50% and adjusted EBITDA positive, if not for the one-time impact of our former Amazon partner going out of business. The improvement in margins during the year were due to warehouse changes, improving our channel mix, PPV reduction and the onboarding of Amazon 1P. These were significant operational achievements for our small operations team. These combined efforts of expense reductions, marketing efficiency and margin improvements, brought our debt to adjusted EBITDA near breakeven in the most efficient operating position in our history.\r\n At the start of 2023, we focus intensely on channel health key channels like Amazon Target and Walmart saw significant reductions in weeks on hand, while sell-through improve getting to a healthier channel position, an additional 800 Wal-Mart doors fueled over 100% growth in sell through year over year we added distribution of our Duo two products to dream stocked in all Best Buy stores and onboarded Amazon 1P. The combined sales effort helped fuel the sell-through needed to improve our channel health at retail. We also addressed imbalanced international inventory with strong sell through in the second half producing weeks on hand to manageable levels. Overall are weeks on hand are now healthy. It navigated this even while overcoming the buybuy BABY bankruptcy were liquidations temporarily impacted other channels overall across 2023, we improved weeks on hand with our retailers by over 45% from the beginning of 2023, setting us up for strong revenue growth in 2024 as we enter 2024, our has the best product portfolio in the industry, strong sales momentum, healthy level of channel inventory, scalable operations and FDA clearance. We're now focused on the rapidly expanding medical distribution, elevating our retail presence, all while maintaining our operational and financial efficiency and discipline. In addition, we're eyeing two important milestones ahead of us to further unlock growth and market access.\r\n First, European expansion, CE. medical clearance of focus for early 2024 will propel continued European momentum and open new markets. Second, software and services providers are now able to use our data to better enable care at home and outlet will be developing software and services behind this new theme that will empower parents with new insights and better close the loop between health care in the home these new services will be introduced in 2024 and begin to shape our revenue and margin story in 2025. I'm incredibly proud of our team's perseverance and the amazing work done in 2023. Our mission to empower parents fuels their dedication during challenging times. This was evident in our donation to our foundation partners of over $1.4 million worth of Dream socks to families in need. In addition, fundraising for Sid's research, which raised over $150,000 and support for grieving parents were outlet and our partners donated and planted trees over 500 trees in memory of these parents precious little ones. We are dedicated to serving the families and communities who need it. The most and I'm grateful and proud of the team that took time to give back while also pulling outlets through very difficult times. I'm incredibly excited about the growth and opportunity we've unlocked for 2024 and beyond have been on this journey with CAD and our community of over 2 million parents for over 10 years now. And I can tell you Alan has never been in a better market position.\r\n Our time is now. Thank you, Kate, over to you for the financial highlights.\n\nKath Scolnick\n\nThank you, Curt, and thanks to everyone joining us today in Q4 2023, our demonstrated strong financial performance. I'll spend the next few minutes walking through key financial metrics and providing some additional detail. Gross billings for the fourth quarter were $32.9 million. Product promotions and discounts were $5.9 million and returns and allowances reserves were $5.7 million within this $3.1 million was related to the transition of our business on the Amazon platform. Excluding the Amazon platform, returns and allowances were approximately 8% of gross billings within our average range Q4 revenue, which excludes returns and sales discounts, was $21 million. Gross billings for the full year 2023 were $73.2 million revenue, which excludes returns and sales discounts was $54 million entering into 2023. Our sell-in to distributors it outpaced sell through to consumers. And during the course of the year, our partners were able to work through their excess inventory, bringing sell-in and sell through into healthy balance. By year end, Q4 sell through units were up 32% sequentially, demonstrating a fourth consecutive quarter of sell-through growth in 2023. We ended 2023 with overall sell-through increasing 27% year over year at the top four retailers. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was over 47%, a significant increase from 27.8% in the same period last year. Gross margin for the full year 2023 was 41.8%, a significant improvement over margins of 33.7% from 2022. Our strategies to expand gross margin of a multifaceted we've been focused on improving our sales product mix and optimizing our promotional strategy. We've also been working diligently to reduce our cost of goods sold where possible, including negotiating better terms with our suppliers and improving our shipping and warehouse processes.\r\n Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $13 million, including stock-based compensation of $2.3 million, representing a 46% decrease of $11.1 million year over year.

Excluding stock based compensation, 2023, operating expenses were $41.3 million. The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to employee-related costs and marketing spend. The measurable progress towards operating profitability in 2023 is an important foundational shift for our U.S. business. Fourth quarter net loss was $6.9 million for the quarter, a 65% decrease from $19.5 million in Q4 2022 for the full year net loss of $32.9 million, a decrease of $46.4 million year over year.

We remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives to further strengthen our commercial and financial performance in 2024. With revenue growth, sustained gross margins and controlled expense management, we believe we can continue to drive shareholder value.\r\n 2024 is off to a strong start. Looking ahead we will again refrain from providing specific quarterly guidance. We are focused on executing on the core business activities in 2024 that will maximize supporting dream product commercialization and driving continual Bowne's of sell-in and sell through retail inventory. From a linearity perspective, we anticipate a seasonal sell in step down in Q1 from Q4 and particularly with the strong Amazon one-piece sales this past Q4 fall by sequentially. Strong sell in Q2 for Mother's Day holiday promotions and Prime Day second half sell-in for the November December holiday promotions usually take place in Q3, making strides in ramping babies that commercialization with muted DME partnerships fairly set revenue will begin ramping as we develop our important long-term DME partnerships in 2024 and aligned for revenue model impacts in 2025, driving gross margins within our target range of 45% to 50% through unit volume, product mix and ongoing operational efficiencies and driving our operational planning towards breakeven and sustainable profitability. We are targeting operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, between $10 million to $20 million per quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to the Q&A portion. Operator, please open up the call to questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nFirstly, we will now begin the Q&A session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. To remove your question, press star followed by two again to ask a question, press star one. And if you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before asking your questions.\r\n Our first question today comes from Charles Rhyee with PT Cowen. Please proceed.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nThanks, and congratulations, guys. On a split ended the year strong here on Kate or Curt, maybe just touch on Amazon a little bit here. Obviously, the direct selling to Amazon, what's the importance of that and what you what why should we see this as a real significant step forward for the Company?\n\nKurt Workman\n\nYes. Thanks, Charles, for the question. And I think one of the big things to note is that Amazon is our largest channel, something close to 30% of our revenue is driven through Amazon. So this is a really important channel for us. And traditionally, we've been working with third-party sellers on Amazon. They help manage the logistics and compliance with Amazon's fulfillment process. And then they also help with some of the marketing on Amazon for us as we progress through 2023, we realized the holiday sell-through was growing for getting into a healthier position. We are worried about some of the partner's financial strength. And at the same time, Amazon approached us they usually work with kind of the top 70 brands in every category of the kind of the top brands in every category. And outlet was one of the brands that they weren't working with the top in our in the baby category. And so we're really excited about the opportunity. What it provides is better financial stability, better margins, the unit economics through Amazon are better. And then going through third party distribution, we get additional placements as part of our agreement for advertising and marketing fund and give us better elevation. And so all of that combined puts a much better margin profile for the business, specifically within that channel as we move into 2024. And then combining that with the FDA clearances, this channels is one, we expect to see a lot of growth.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nYes. And maybe just sticking with the clearance, obviously, you're the only FDA cleared have a product that's available in stores. Maybe talk a little bit about the competitive landscape. I know Massimo has a product out there or maybe just give us an update on what you're seeing in the rest of them?\n\nKurt Workman\n\nYes. I would say the number one concern our customers had heading into Q4 was it was around the confusion with the FDA. And so being able to announce that Allied is the first and only FDA-cleared monitor for over-the-counter use. That's still the case today. There's no other monitor that has FDA approval to sell over the counter and through retail channels to empower parents directly with all the health information. So outlets, outlets in that position. And what we saw as a result of that is that it opened up the bottom of the funnel, the top of the funnel has been pretty healthy. The awareness around it's been really good. And there's just been this question mark around, is it FDA approved? Should I buy this from ABB. And we will able to answer that very clearly for consumers in Q4 and they respond. And that's why our sell-through doubled during the holiday period year over year with that specific messaging and the press around that, we're really excited about that opportunity. I think this year, it's been put into a new category. We are the only FDA-cleared monitor on shelves. Our retail partners are really excited about that. They're giving outlet more shelf space for differentiating element from the competition. We're able to do that through our marketing and and labeling, which is really, really exciting. So what we're seeing is now that was the number one monitor in the category, and we expect that distance to continue.\r\n Kris in 2024.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nThat's great. And maybe switching over to Lisa, a little bit quickly on this one. I think you had talked about of partnering with a direct medical equipment distributor. Maybe give us an update there where you're at with that? I think you had already selected one or you've been you partnered with one. Maybe give us a little bit more details there.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nAnd yes, of course, we partnered we announced a partnership with AdaptHealth at the beginning of January adapters and nationwide and distributor of medical devices. They have relationships with every national insurance payer in the United States. They're in a big portion of the hospitals throughout the country. And so there's a perfect partner for Allied to go to market with as we begin to sell babies that they're integrating with all the insurance companies. They've integrated with our website so that the checkout experience through our website as seamless for our customers, they do all of the prescription verification, all the insurance verification. We've got a sales group of hundreds of sales reps that are taking our lead now to and to hospitals. That's obviously a channel. That takes a little bit of time to build things move a little bit more slowly, but we're really excited about that partnership deal. You'll hear more partnerships announced probably every quarter this year as we're building out that medical distribution. But we're really excited about this first step into that into medical distribution.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nGreat. And sorry, two more questions from me. The first one on international, that's you kind of moved into Europe early on before some of the things that kind of got delayed here. Maybe give us an update on where your ICE. mark. And when you get to CE Mark, is that for an over-the-counter product or is that for a prescription product? Just curious on the distinction.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nQuestion is for an over-the-counter product, Europe's a little bit different in terms of their we have prescription and over-the-counter here for pulse oximetry. There, you can get medical distribution and have an over-the-counter product but it is specifically for over-the-counter use. We'll be able to sell it through all of our retail channels that we've set up there. And we think it's going to have a huge impact on not only the expanded distribution that we've been working on, but also the same thing, the opening up the bottom part of the funnel. We've worked hard for a few years to build awareness. And we believe this is going to drive additional conversion and more partnership opportunities. So we're very close to it. We've been able to leverage a lot of the and a lot of the work in a lot of the studies that we did for FDA clearances. And we feel like we're in that kind of final steps. You're getting clearance.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nGreat. And maybe my last question, Kate, if we kind of look at the quarter here and you kind of back on sort of the one-time items that you kind of noted with particularly with the shift to Amazon, it looked like gross margins were north of 50% and adjusted EBITDA would have been positive for the quarter. I know you're not really giving afford guidance per se, but maybe you could help us think through sort of how margins are you thinking about margin progression and sort of sort of if we move to profitability?\n\nKath Scolnick\n\nYes. Yes. As I said, we're looking at the trajectory that we have through the year.\r\n And what we're trying to get to our long-term model is really margin between 45% and 50%. Some of the isolation just kind of comes with the on the pace through the year as we talked about. The other is the Q1 being a step down from Q4 just given volumes and then as it ramps up in Q2, Q3 with the different arms holidays and promotions and prime days. So I think that what we're seeing is more on gravitation that we have towards our Soffe product. That is obviously the hero product as it relates to margin. So mix moving towards there is a benefit on looking further out, as I mentioned, as Baby Phat ramps out further into 2025 on that will be a margin benefit to the model as well.\r\n In terms of adjusted EBITDA. We're not changing our profile as it relates to expense. So excluding stock-based compensation, operating expense being between $10 million to $12 million per quarter were looking at leverage in the model that way. You know, depending on where the revenue currently on each quarter, we'll see that improving to our goal is to be in a sustainably profitable company. And I think the benefits of 2023 that we made in taking as much expense as we did out, we don't want to lose that momentum that we have. So the opportunities that we have to put our working capital towards the FDA-cleared products this year, having revenue growth that will get us to that over the sustainable on line, if you will, in 2024 and beyond to make this really a company that is focused on being that independent growth company with a profitability lens. So still some work to do in 2024. But I think what you'll see is that that improvement continues as we go through the year.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nThat's great. And I'm sorry, maybe one more here. You're talking about opening at the bottom of the funnel and you saw that going to double in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense on what that trend looks like? Obviously, here in the first quarter so far? Are we still seeing? Yes, returns of.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nYes, I would say no, it hasn't been a double kind of in the first quarter of 2024 but we've seen definitely double digit growth year over year for Dream PSoC, which is the part of the sales mix that's really starting to outperform and do those close to that so we have seen sustained sell through left. That's really promising as we go into 2024 and we can build on. And is it significant?\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nYes. Appreciate all the questions. Thank you.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nThanks, Charles.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for your question. There are no further questions in queue. So I will now pass the conference back over to Mike Cavanagh for further questions that came in via e-mail.\n\nMike Cavanaugh\n\nThanks very much, operator. Yes, we did have we have received some questions from investors and particularly some of our retail investors that wanted to share during the Q&A session today.\r\n So the first one, congratulations team on the third on 13 trillion heartbeats. Are there efforts to identify potential correlations between heartbeats and various medical conditions or sleep quality what can you tell us about the product roadmap and some of the other products like band and crib, considering both FDA clearances and your extensive dataset compared to competitors that should be an advantage for you?\n\nKurt Workman\n\nYes, I'll take this one and yes, it has one of the largest data sets of infant health at home and a fantastic data science team. We've known for a long time that the potential of our data and our technology and the value we can drive from those insights is immense. We've really been eliminated for years just being a consumer device and limitations around being in the consumer device space.\r\n So now with FDA clearance, we can really start to unleash our data and technology for parents and providers that's a big part of this year. I talked a little bit about software and services. So our focus in 2024 is really two things. It's to drive adoption of our medical devices, and we're seeing the momentum in that area and launching software and services to leverage our data. So we really do believe that there's significant revenue and margin growth and as we progress here by focusing on those two specific areas with about 140 million babies born globally, we're just scratching the surface of our long-term potential. So stay tuned for more of this is a really exciting area that we'll be sharing more and more about.\n\nMike Cavanaugh\n\nOkay. Thanks, Curt. The next question as an investor, I appreciate the strong support from Eclipse as well as the active participation of the Board in the recent offering. And that clearly demonstrates confidence in our going forward with the public float at only about 20% of total shares. Do you have any thoughts on the best way to build shareholder value? And then what in the current macro environment, how does outlet push forward and stick out from the others?\n\nKath Scolnick\n\nYes, I can take that question because as a microcap company, I think along with others, we've been impacted by these conditions of the capital markets, especially since they've continued to be drawn out over what seems like a long period of time, we've had the financial support of our largest investors and our banking and trade partners. So we've been able to continue to also execute against our mission and vision. I think Vito, This support has been really helpful in our ability to deliver against our business and operational plans in 2023 that we've just spent time discussing today. And these accomplishments set us up for even more success in 2024. So we believe that the execution of last year. And also the executional plans that we talked about for 2024 is what puts us in the best position to continue to build and shareholder value right now.\n\nMike Cavanaugh\n\nOkay, thanks, Kate. Next question, does outlet plan to launch in India or other Asian countries? And if so, what is the potential time line for that?\n\nKurt Workman\n\nYes. I mentioned that we're very close on the CMS clearance. I'm really proud of the team's work there. That's the near term focus, but there are 140 million babies born across the world every single year. And parenting really has universal, meaning there's it doesn't matter where your babies born parents care about their child safety and their health and and then being able to get a good night's sleep. And so our technology has a really big opportunity to have an impact across the globe. We're really excited about this in 2020 for our specific focus is on expansion of our medical device in Europe. There's a lot of room for growth there, and then we'll open up other geographies in coming years.\n\nMike Cavanaugh\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kurt.\r\n Next question, given the Democrat, the demographic of our target market, how important is social media and influencer marketing? And can we expect celebrity type marketing for the outlet stock in the future.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nSo we work really hard to meet parents really where they're at with messages that resonate with them in channels that you know, they spend their time. And one shining example for us recently is that TikTok TikTok strategy that we've put in place, put a large emphasis on getting outlets, storied 100 communities. And those stories include really fun and creative content about parenting, very serious and emotional content around the parent or the child story and their health journey for outlet detecting that the baby had low oxygen and parents being able to intervene in time and that those stories have had a big impact. We've even had a lot of user-generated stories and partner stories. Somebody wrote a song of that outlet and are ever about their child and included holidays. So we do a lot of work on social fit over 100 million video views and engagements at last year. And we want to be a very authentic connection with parents. And it's obvious that parents telling real stories and real-life examples in the word of mouth behind our product is always meaningful talent. It's been a big part of growing our brand and our awareness and being able to do that also what cutting marketing expenses. So a lot of opportunities at that. And there are a lot of celebrities who use that organically and share about outlet because they absolutely love the product. And so we feel like that's the that's the approach that resonates the best with Paris.\n\nMike Cavanaugh\n\nAll right. Great. And we have one final question that we received. I noticed there was a PR firm, a public that is public relations firm hired towards the end of the year. Can you speak to that and the strategy behind?\n\nKurt Workman\n\nYes, I would just simply say that outlet really, again, we're in a first and only position we are the first and only approved FDA monitor for over-the-counter distribution, and we're taking advantage of that in the market today by driving awareness and cleaning up any confusion in the market. That's existed. We've had hundreds of articles written about it and just the last few months, millions of parents engaging with that message, thanks to our social and our PR team that's doing a fantastic job. And that's a big reason why we're seeing this organic lift and sell through people now know that it is in that position and we're the best available option so this is a massive year for us.\n\nMike Cavanaugh\n\nAll right. I think that's it for our supplemental questions.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nOperator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll now pass the conference over to Craig Whitman for closing remarks.\n\nKurt Workman\n\nThank you. Yes.\r\n As we look ahead, we're excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us. We're focused on expanding our product footprint, driving revenue growth, improving operating leverage and achieving further profitability. Our strategies and initiatives are designed to capitalize on our recent product introductions and regulatory successes and to continue to deliver value to our shareholders.\r\n In conclusion, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders to our clients and our dedicated employees for their unwavering support and loyalty and your belief in our mission and commitment to our vision has been instrumental in our achievements this past year. Thank you.\r\n As we look forward to 2024, we are energized by our progress and the momentum that we felt and we're committed to our mission of helping children live long, happy and healthy lives. We're excited to continue our journey with all of you. Thank you once again for your continued support and for joining us on this call today.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 Cities with the Highest Debt in the US. You can also take a detailed look at the 5 Cities with the Highest Debt in the US.\n\nDebt, both at the personal and governmental levels, is a complex and multifaceted issue that can have far-reaching implications for individuals, communities, and entire nations. In the United States, cities are not immune to the challenges of debt, and for some, the burden can be particularly heavy. This debt can be in various forms, including general obligation bonds, pension liabilities, and unfunded mandates, among others. One key metric often used to gauge a city's debt load is debt per capita, which provides insights into the level of indebtedness relative to the population size.\n\nTo understand the gravity of the matter, it's essential to unpack the factors contributing to it. From pension obligations to infrastructure investment, each city's debt profile is shaped by a unique set of circumstances and decisions made by local governments over time. Additionally, the presence of major public companies headquartered in these cities can further influence their economic landscape and financial dynamics.\n\nFor instance, the city of New York, is often regarded as the financial capital of the world. With a population exceeding 8 million and a GDP rivaling that of many countries, New York City is a powerhouse of commerce and culture. However, it also carries a significant debt burden, with one of the highest debts per capita in the US. Despite its robust economy, the city grapples with challenges such as aging infrastructure, affordable housing shortages, and pension liabilities, which contribute to its debt load.\n\nSimilarly, Chicago, Illinois, known for its iconic skyline and vibrant arts scene, faces its own fiscal challenges. With debt per capita exceeding $8,000, the city struggles to balance its budget amidst pension obligations and declining population trends. Despite being home to major corporations such as Boeing and United Airlines, Chicago's city debt burden has now reached $42,000 for every taxpayer; this shows the need for comprehensive fiscal reform and prudent financial management.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond these examples, cities like Atlanta, Dallas, and Seattle, each offer unique insights into the complexities of municipal debt. From the booming tech sector in Seattle to the energy industry in Dallas, these cities are hubs of innovation and opportunity. Yet, they also confront challenges such as income inequality, infrastructure investment, and pension obligations, which contribute to their debt burdens.\n\nAmong many large companies that are situated in cities with higher debt; Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), another Seattle-based powerhouse, revolutionized the coffee industry and established itself as a global brand synonymous with quality and convenience. With thousands of coffee shops worldwide and a diverse portfolio of products, Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) contributes significantly to Seattle's economy through job creation, tourism, and tax revenues.\n\nDespite the immense economic contributions of these companies, Seattle faces a stark reality in terms of its debt burden. According to recent municipal financial reports, Seattle's debt per capita exceeds $5,000, reflecting the challenges posed by infrastructure investment, pension obligations, and other fiscal commitments. This figure stands in stark contrast to the billions of dollars generated by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) collectively, highlighting the significant gap between the city's economic prowess and its financial challenges. 15 Cities with the Highest Debt in the US\n\nA close-up of a contract being signed, depicting a transaction for Mezzanine, Growth Capital, and Debt Investments.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 15 Cities with the Highest Debt in the US we have considered rankings of US cities with highest municipal debts per taxpayer in USD from multiple reputable sources like: US News, Forbes, and Financial State of the Cities 2024 / Truth in Accounting. This list below has been arranged from least indebted cities to the most indebted cities. The list is presented in descending order of scores, with higher scores corresponding to lower levels of debt.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Steeped in colonial history and maritime traditions, Baltimore boasts a wealth of cultural landmarks, including the iconic Inner Harbor, Fort McHenry, and the renowned Walters Art Museum.

        "title": "TikTok Divestment Push Advances With House Committee Approval",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Congress moved a step closer to forcing TikTok’s Chinese parent to sell the popular video-sharing platform over national security concerns, with a committee advancing legislation Thursday that would block app stores and internet service providers from offering it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil How Trump’s Ex-Treasury Chief Landed 2024's Highest-Profile US Bank Deal Stocks Climb on Bets Fed, ECB Closer to Rate Cuts: Markets Wrap Biden to Direct Military to Build Gaza Port to Deliver Aid New York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight Crime\n\nTikTok mounted a last-minute effort to counter the bill, which was unveiled Tuesday, by urging its users to call congressional offices to protest the bill via a message that greeted them when they opened the app. Users flooded members offices with calls, drawing the ire of House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher.\n\nLawmakers said “their phones were ringing off the hook last night,” Gallagher told journalists outside the Capitol on Thursday. “The intimidation tactics, the disinformation has to stop,” he said later in a video message.\n\nIn the end the campaign was unsuccessful, at least in preventing lawmakers from taking the first step toward enacting the legislation. The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted 50-0 Thursday to approve the bill and advance it toward the House floor.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have long expressed national security concerns over TikTok’s ties to its owner ByteDance Ltd., citing risks of the Chinese government collecting personal data from American users and spreading propaganda on the app. The platform has been under a national security review since the Trump administration. The Biden administration has signaled cautious support for the proposal, with White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying Wednesday that “we would want to see this bill get done.”\n\nStory continues\n\nPrevious legislative attempts to restrict the app nationwide have failed, and this one would still have to clear legislative hurdles in the House and Senate. But lawmakers say this latest effort has been months in the making, fueled partly by renewed security concerns that China is surveilling Americans. The legislation would give ByteDance six months to divest from TikTok.\n\nRead More: TikTok Can Keep ‘Bad Lip-Sync,’ Lawmakers Seeking Sale Say\n\nTikTok has consistently denied that it has or will share any US user data with Beijing and has tried to assuage US concerns by spending more than $1.5 billion to isolate its US operations and agreeing to oversight from American partner Oracle Corp. TikTok said in a statement that the legislation would trample First Amendment free speech rights and deprive millions of small businesses of a platform on which they rely.\n\nThe app is already emerging as an important place for conversations in a presidential election year. President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has even created an account on the app ahead of November’s vote. More than 170 million Americans scroll the app every month, making its users an important asset.\n\nAfter the vote, TikTok said in a posting on X, formerly Twitter, that the new bill “has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States.”\n\n(Updates with detail on TikTok’s influence with voters)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair How Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall Humanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Airbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s Expense\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Amazon’s generative AI bot Rufus makes online shopping easier (for the most part)",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is bringing generative AI to its shopping app via its new Rufus chatbot. I’ve used a good deal of generative AI apps so far, and they’ve largely focused on searching the web, helping write emails, and making putting together PowerPoints a bit less, well, hellish.\n\nRufus, however, is designed to make shopping quicker and easier by providing you with answers to questions about product categories and individual items. The chatbot, which is trained on Amazon’s product catalog and web data, appears at the bottom of the Amazon shopping app as a tab that you swipe up to access. It doesn’t replace the regular search bar at the top of the screen. Rather, it serves as a means of expanding on it.\n\nOf course, if Rufus takes off among consumers, it will be a major win for Amazon. That’s because the chatbot could get users to spend more time in Amazon’s shopping app and less time looking up information about products on Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which could lead them to buy goods through competing online stores.\n\nI got an early look at a beta version of Rufus to see how well it works. And while it isn’t perfect, it did make shopping for things like video games, cat food, and weightlifting equipment easier.\n\nI needed windshield wipers for my car, so I typed wipers into the search bar at the top of the screen. Rufus then appeared in a small box at the bottom of the screen with suggested follow-up questions such as “What are the different types of windshield wipers available?”, “How do I choose the right windshield wiper size for my vehicle?”, and “What are the features to look for when buying windshield wipers?” Rufus can provide a rundown of different types of products such as windshield wipers. (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nTap a suggestion, and you’ll get the appropriate answer. For instance, tapping “What are the features to look for when buying windshield wipers?” gave me a list of items to consider, including blade type, blade size, wiper rubber quality, and adapter type. Riveting stuff, I know. But if you’re tired of hearing your wipers screech like nails on a chalkboard every time it rains, these are the kinds of things you want to know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nI also needed — well, wanted — to shop for the game “Final Fantasy VII Remake.” The problem is there are a few versions of this game on the market, and deciding which one to buy can be a pain. So I decided to check with Rufus to see if it could distinguish between the versions of the game, and, to my surprise, it did just that.\n\nNot only did Rufus manage to tell the difference between the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 versions of the game, it also knew the differences between the base version of the game and an expanded version. Rufus provided an in-depth explanation of the differences between the two versions of the game \"Final Fantasy VII Remake.\" (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nBut here’s where Rufus trips up. One of the follow-up questions it offered was “What are the best weapons and armor to get in ‘Final Fantasy 7 Remake?'” The chatbot gave me a basic rundown of how to pick weapons and armor in the game, choose items that hit an enemy’s weaknesses, etc., but it then brought up buying options for a “Final Fantasy VII” character action figure and a seemingly unrelated wig.\n\nThe bot rebounded when I started searching for weight plates for my home gym, providing the pros and cons of metal versus rubber plates, explaining that while metal plates last longer, rubber plates will do less damage to my floor. That kind of insight can be incredibly useful for someone who’s just getting into lifting and doesn’t know which kind of plate to buy.\n\nBut when I changed up the question to \"What are differences between metal plates and rubber plates?\" it became confused and gave me a search option for metal dining plates, but a description of metal weightlifting plates. Rufus can get confused when asking questions. Here, it couldn't distinguish between whether I was asking about metal weightlifting plates or metal dining plates. (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nI also tried looking up some items I should buy for an upcoming trip to Ireland. When I asked Rufus “What should I buy before leaving for vacation in Ireland?” the bot offered an Ireland travel guide book, lightweight rain jacket, sweater, walking shoes, and a power adapter. Rufus provided an explanation for each suggestion, as well, saying that Ireland’s climate can be rainy, and that even in the summer, evening temperatures can be rather cool.\n\nWhen I tapped on a suggested follow-up question asking about the top attractions and destinations in Ireland, Rufus gave me information about certain areas including the Cliffs of Moher and Giant’s Causeway. The app then provided information about each locale, complete with books or movies for purchase related to the areas.\n\nFinally, I tried asking Rufus for the cheapest paper towels.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On today's call, we hope to achieve several objectives. First, we're excited to share our successful results for the fourth quarter and details on key financial milestones that leave us strengthened as we close out 2023. Second, we'll share our outlook for 2024. And third, we will provide our new long-range financial algorithm and a strategic update detailing the differentiated attributes of our company and key drivers for our long-term growth. To complement our discussion today, please find our new investor presentation available on honest, Investor Relations website.\r\n As I round the corner on my 1st year as CEO of the Honest Company. I'm extremely proud of the results we will share today, but I must acknowledge that 2023 has been a year of tremendous change. As I mentioned when I was with you a year ago, we were not satisfied with our past results. We were a company in need of a transformation and our teams quickly went into action to define our transformation initiative and a new operating mindset. As a result of these efforts, we strengthened our business performance, our team culture and our financial results. These 2023 improvements include expanding our gross margins by 900, 30 basis points since Q1, doubling our cash position year over year and achieving a major milestone in the fourth quarter. By delivering positive adjusted EBITDA and positive net income. We expanded margins and achieved our profitability goal while also driving double-digit top line growth in the quarter. But among our most meaningful accomplishments this year is the way our honest team collaborated to drive focus, clarity and alignment on our ambitious business goals. So I want to take a moment to thank our entire Onex team for the remarkable ways that they strengthened our culture and delivered and even exceeded their commitments this year.\r\n Our transformation initiative pillars of brand maximization margin enhancement and operating discipline have each contributed meaningfully to our business model improvements. We exited 2023 with growth in both units and dollar sales, strong marketing efficiency, a healthier balance sheet and a clear path to ongoing profitability. And our brand continues to grow in relevance and scale as shown by the growth of our household penetration, which has now crossed the threshold of 5%. I'm confident that with our stronger foundation, growing consumer residents and a clear vision of the future, we will continue to advance on its mission as a personal care company that courageously challenges, ingredients, ideals and industries through the power of our brand, our team and our honest standard. And now I'll turn it over to Dave to share the financial details of our strong fourth quarter and our 2024 outlook.\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nThank you, Carla, and welcome, everyone. Our team's work over the last 12 months has helped us to build a strong financial foundation. We achieved 10% revenue growth both for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, while also expanding gross margins and reducing operating expenses. We mark 2023 as a significant turnaround period for the Company. And we expect the improving financial trends to continue in 2024 and beyond, as we will share today, in our strategic update, but first, let me dive deeper into the fourth quarter results. This quarter, we delivered a record high revenue of $90 million, up 10%, driven by strong results in the digital channel, including robust consumption at Amazon price increases implemented across the portfolio over the course of 2023 and increased volume growth due to both greater velocity and distribution gains by product category. Our Diapers and Wipes revenue increased 15% in the fourth quarter, driven by new distribution price increases and strong sales momentum in wipes, whilst growth was especially strong in the quarter through increased velocity, larger pack sizes and innovation, including on our new flushable wipes.\r\n Next, our Skin and Personal Care revenue declined 6% in the quarter due to exiting distribution and low margin channels. This was partially offset by strong consumption growth in baby personal care. In fact, we remain the number-one natural baby personal care brand at Target and Walmart as we continue to grow our breadth of products in the baby category.\r\n And finally, our Household and Wellness revenue increased 28% in the fourth quarter reflecting strong performance of the baby clothing business.\r\n Turning to results by channel. In the fourth quarter, digital revenue increased 28%, driven by meaningful growth with Amazon. Our Amazon business has benefited from high return marketing and improved supply chain planning. Retail revenue decreased 3% due to exiting distribution and low margin channels, partially offset by continued benefit from distribution into new retail outlets.\r\n Our gross margin in the fourth quarter was 34%, up 930 basis points from the first quarter of 2023 and 600 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due to improvements from cost savings and pricing. This represents our highest quarterly gross margin in over two years.\r\n Operating expenses decreased $6 million in the fourth quarter compared to last year, reflecting higher marketing efficiency and lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was positive $4 million, which surpassed our original guidance. This also resulted in positive operating income for the quarter, marking the first time achieving this as a public company.\r\n Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $33 million in cash, more than doubling our cash position of $15 million at the end of 2022. We also achieved positive operating cash flow for the third consecutive quarter. Our cash position improved from continued discipline in managing working capital, including significant reductions in inventory. For 2023, inventory was reduced by 36% or $42 million, while also supporting 10% revenue growth. Our balance sheet remains strong with zero debt outstanding. Overall, these results strengthen our confidence in the strategic direction we are sharing today with that, let's turn to our annual outlook for 2024. Our full year 2024 financial outlook includes low to mid single digit percentage revenue growth and positive adjusted EBITDA in the low single digit to mid-single digit millions range. We are expecting a softer first half of the year compared to an improved second half due to retailer ordering patterns and exiting distribution and low margin channels. We expect higher revenue growth in the back half of the year due to timing of our distribution gains and new product innovation launches. Our adjusted EBITDA outlook includes operating margin expansion, derived from improved gross margin and operating expense leverage. Our transformation pillars will continue to enable our profitable growth. We envision 2024 as a year of continued strengthening of our financial foundation in order to accelerate strategic growth in 2025 and beyond.\r\n And now I will turn the discussion back over to Karla to share our vision for Honest's next chapter.\n\nCarla Vernon\n\nThank you for the comprehensive overview of the team's great work in 2023, and I look ahead at 2024. Now I'm pleased to share our updated vision for the company. We believe Onex is truly a consumer products company built for modern times. Now that we have an improved financial foundation, we are in a great position to further unleash the distinctive elements. Of the honest brand honest, was born out of a desire to bring a higher standard for clean ingredients and sustainable design to baby and personal care products. And to this day, we hold every product we sell to the honest standard. This standard is a set of guiding principles that puts our mission into action. The honest standard is the compass that guides how we deliver on consumers' expectations. At honest, our standard always begins with clean ingredients. As we noted in our investor presentation, the market for sensitive skin care products is expected to be $80 billion by 2030, which is nearly double today's $41 billion market. Additionally, the presence of skin allergies in children has nearly doubled since 1997. This is why our entire portfolio distinguishes itself by eliminating more than 35 hundred chemicals and materials of concern from our products. Our own honest standard is a more strict benchmark than the restrictions dictated by either EU or U.S. regulations. But our success goes beyond our approach to ingredients. We are reshaping and revolutionizing categories in other ways. For example, we revolutionized baby care with our approach to seasonal fashion inspired diaper prints, matching baby apparel, baby gifting and inspiring wellness rituals that take baby bath time to a whole new level in the most recent period of Cercon data honest ranks as the number one natural brand in baby care with the successful launch of our plant-based flushable wipes and the great success of our IQstream lengthening mascara, which is Amazon's leading Climate Pledge friendly mascara. We have seen that the honest brand is as meaningful to adults for products that they use themselves. With this evidence, we are confident that honest, meets a broad set of needs that are growing in demand. This was the cornerstone of the comprehensive strategic research we performed to define the business landscape and market opportunities. We studied the needs and preferences of thousands of consumers and hosted personal conversations with people who use honest products and people who do not through the assessment of consumer needs and the available opportunity. We have crafted a clear vision of how to continue growing the power of the honest brand by scaling distribution, introducing strong innovation, entering new categories and our continued leadership as a modern brand builder. We will do this while maintaining our disciplined financial and operating mindset to share more detail on this growth vision and our long-range algorithm. I will now turn it back over to Dave.\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nThanks, Carla. We believe the key principles that underpin our long term plan for profitable scalable growth include three key elements distribution to expand availability, modern brand building to drive velocities and cost management to ensure profitable growth. First, within distribution, we will maximize the extensive distribution opportunities available to us. These opportunities are multifaceted and include distribution through new retail partnerships and growth at our current retailers. We have a long-standing retail partnership with Target recently expanding our shelf space in baby toiletries, and we see opportunity for further in store expansion with Target and other current retailers. We also see a runway for expansion with our new retailers, including Walmart, we have shown an ability to grow distribution, but still remain underpenetrated relative to the competition. For example, we have an opportunity to expand in more channels with large retailer segments, including club discount, drug and grocery and more beauty is specialty retailers. In addition to expanding distribution through new stores and doors, we have an opportunity to expand aisles and shelf facings with current retailers. In fact, in most categories honest, has less than half the number of SKUs on shelf than leading competitors. Another distribution opportunity is growing. Our best-selling Hero items, which we believe are underpenetrated. One example is our top-rated hydrogel moisturizing cream, which has less than 20% ACV. We are also focused on bringing new product innovation to the baby aisle and beyond innovation. Within our core and adjacent categories, we'll support our objective of increased availability. As Karla mentioned, consumer research indicates that we have a large opportunity to take the honest brand into new categories within the personal care universe, the market opportunity in Personal Care is significantly larger than the baby aisle and natural personal care is expected to grow faster than the broader personal care category.\r\n The second key driver of growth will be improved velocities, supported by our modern brand-building approach to accelerate our velocities and penetration. We'll be focused on a marketing strategy with best in class brand building. This will include clear consumer targeting differentiated messaging and modern ways of connecting our marketing effectiveness will be more tailored by activating cutting edge paid media, revitalizing our creative images and leveraging our content creators to amplify key campaigns. We have already started to see benefits of these enhancement enhancements by quadrupling the number of new households that are new to our brand at Amazon in Q4.\r\n Third, driver of profitable growth is an ongoing focus on cost management. We will build on the progress we made in 2023 on improving the financial results, we remain committed to expanding gross margins through cost savings and improved mix of our portfolio. Similarly, we will continue to improve the efficiency of our operating structure, with benefits from reducing non-strategic spend and gaining leverage across fixed costs as we scale these actions, which began with the new leadership team will put us on a path to sustainable positive operating margins and the bottom line that grows faster than the top line. This brings us to introducing our new long-term financial algorithm, which includes expected revenue growth of 4% to 6% annually and continue adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This long-term financial view is grounded in our updated strategic plan as well as our transformation pillars of brand maximization, margin enhancement and operating discipline. Together, these frameworks set the building blocks for long-term value creation. I encourage you to review our updated investor presentation that outlines the strategic vision in more detail.\r\n In closing, we remain confident that we can continue to build on the stabilizing results from last year and realize our profitable growth goals as a leading modern CPG company.\r\n And now I'll turn the call over to the operator.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Aaron Grey, Alliance Global Partners.\n\nAaron Grey\n\nHi, good evening here.\r\n A nice quarter here, and thank you for the question. Tom, just in terms of the top line, Digital had a nice quarter, it looks like some of the Amazon investments, pay dividends, you pointed to a number of levers driving growth going forward. So as we look to 2024 and your long-term sales guidance, how should we think about how to leverage our pulled more so in the near term versus the long term?\r\n I just think about between channels of brick and mortar distribution in digital? And then can you also provide any color on how much more of a lever you believe those for pricing to be both? Thank you.\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nYes, hi, Aaron. This is Dave. Here from me. As you know, we are looking at the future with a balanced model that that does reflect some of the success that you just saw in the fourth quarter. And digital was a strong driver for us, and that was a lot of growth that we got from Amazon, which which continues to have some some big opportunity for us. So as I talked about, the long term growth opportunity between with distribution being a big component of top line that will that will be a blend of balance, a continued balance of brick and mortar distribution and the digital channel with larger that being Amazon.\r\n So I outlined in the U.S. investor presentation, which you can see the elements of how we see that distribution playing out between entering new stores, increasing the number of locations within those stores and even shelf and facing opportunities. And it's really about maximizing those opportunities that we see driving the growth for us in 2024 and beyond.\r\n And in terms of I think you said, leveraging leveraging the potential for the brand beyond at that period of time, we're going to look at our long range model. And as I shared, it's a balance between driving top line growth, but bottom line growth faster than the top line. And we think that gives us a lot of advantages to to set us up have a strong foundation in the future.\n\nAaron Grey\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for that color. Really appreciate it.\r\n A second quick one for me, just based on the EBITDA guidance and the current run rate, it implies there might be some investments you plan to make behind the brand to drive growth for the year. So any color in terms of no planned uptick in investment, you might have been easier to drive innovation and build brand awareness or otherwise would be greatly appreciated.\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nYes, I think we're really proud with the fourth quarter results. It was a strong revenue period, $90 million. And what what it really illustrates is the power of the model that allows incremental revenue to drop to the bottom line in that period.\r\n Now I'd say looking forward, we do we do have clear sight on positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year, but I wouldn't paint it as a straight line. There will be some periods and I would particularly call it out a soft first half of the year from the top line. But there are investments that we are going to maintain in terms of flexibility in this model to continue to drive demand for marketing. And we're expecting investments in R&D to help drive the innovation side. And we're just going to be you're going to maintain flexibility to get through periods that might have consumer pressures and be able to maintain that top line momentum so I would say that the full year outlook that we provided on adjusted EBITDA is something that we're confident in and can weather through any conditions that we might see what do we face.\n\nAaron Grey\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for the call. I'll jump back in the queue.\n\nOperator\n\n[Shabana Chaudhry], JPM.\n\nShabana Chaudhry\n\nHi. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking our question. And so a big focus is on distribution gains. So if you can please give us what you had of tremendous retail distribution gains on second half of 22 onwards. Can you please give us a sense of what your current shelf space looks like? And when do you expect how much more distribution space you're expecting and what kind of timeframe?\r\n And as a part of that question. We believe Walmart started doing resets in the summer. Are you getting getting any additional space from there? And I have another question. Thank you.\n\nCarla Vernon\n\nSavannah, it's Carla. Thank you so much for joining the call today and thank you for the question. It's great to hear your voice. I'd love to take that question about distribution and really make sure we put that in the context of the journey we've been on and the journey we're going, as you can see in the investor presentation on Page 13 now, excuse me, page 13. It's farther in the document. There is a slide that talks about the fact that we thought about a 12% or 13% CAGR in distribution and total points of distribution for the year since 2019 or so. I think that really reflects that. But in the most recent period for this year, we grew distribution at a 6% rate, a lot of that was driven by Walmart, not exclusively. So however, we have been getting into other retail stores and doors. When we look at our portfolio overall, we know that the opportunity is that even though we've now got quite a large presence in big mega change, let your targets and your Walmart. In many instances, we do not have all of our categories or all of our portfolio in distribution there. For example, when we look at our presence on shelf, even in our diaper category, we only have about 20% of the shelf presence of the key competitor in that category. That same ratio is about the same for us in wipes and in skin facial skin care. So even when we are in Ohio. We know that we are under face at versus what our opportunity really is. We have great conversations going on with our retailers. We have a really very clear line of sight to how we will plan to unlock. As Dave said, new banners, new doors within the banners, new files and broader distribution will come back in the coming quarters to give you the exact add-up of those numbers.\n\nShabana Chaudhry\n\nThank you for the color on that. And I just quickly wanted to touch base and then track channel data. I believe from the previous quarter, you had mentioned you were expecting something in the track channel data to remain pretty high, double digit or so. And but then most recently, it's showing like about mid-single low of high single digits. If you could please comment on that and how you see as you gain distribution to your point, how quickly can we see an uptick in the track channel data as well? Thank you.\n\nCarla Vernon\n\nI'll start. I'll start us off and then Dave, if I miss anything, please.\r\n Let me know. As you know, very well, 2023 was the year, we got the benefit of going from 50% ACV overall to about an 80% ACV for the brand. As a total, what we found are what we find ourselves lapping in some of those instances is either timing for retailers, timing shifts to retailers or pipeline build behind some of the new distribution we've gotten. I don't remember the second part of the question.\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nNo, the current track channel in the high single digits, which is more a reflection of what we're seeing in the consumer consumer spend area with those tracked channels that that are part of that channel, which is about 50% of our overall business.\n\nCarla Vernon\n\nYes, yes, we feel good about what we feel really good about is that we're growing on both dollars and units for overall, which as you've been watching what's happening in the consumer products space, that is such a great indicator for us and our consumer really values not only the distinctiveness of the brand, but that when they're making these choices about which brands best serve their needs, even as we have delivered price advances over the last year, year and a half, our consumers are actually still growing with us on top of the additional distribution, we're still able to demonstrate velocity growth.\n\nShabana Chaudhry\n\nThank you so much. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Laura Champine, Loop.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nThanks and congratulations on achieving profitability faster than we were expecting. And I wanted to ask about free cash flow, which also beat our expectations in the quarter and the year. A lot of that came from an inventory drawdown, though is that have repeatable events? Or should we expect in free cash flow flattish or even a little bit worse than 2024?\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nYes, hi, Laura.Certainly the cash flow gains in 23, we're pretty pronounced and it was that opportunity to rightsize the inventory there. It generated, as well as I'll say that fourth quarter strong earnings earnings results that that just flowed through on to land on our cash balance of $33 million. '24, I do not expect we will have that kind of a cash flow gain and over the course of the year. We do think the inventory levels that are better right-size to the demand in front of us. And so we'll keep managing that to eke out what we can, but we don't expect free cash flow to be to be positive. The ending cash balance of $33 million and where we're at today will certainly cover any additional needs through the balance of the year. But I do want to call out in 2024, we have on some costs related to legal expenses of the cases that are already reported on. And those are those are hard costs and cash cash flow items that we will have a 2024 that would impact our ability to see positive cash flow. So it will be very flat to slightly down, but not much not the kind of positive cash flow that we generated 23.\n\nLaura Champine\n\nGot it. So that will impact cash, but obviously not the adjusted EBITDA outlook that you provided today Correct?\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nThat's correct. That would be an add back. And so but it is a cash outflow kind of.\n\nOperator\n\nDana Telsey, Telsey Advisory\n\nDana Telsey\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. as you think about 2024 and the guidance you gave versus the first half and the second half of the year, given the more tougher comparisons on the top line in the second half of the year. What do you see as the drivers of growth in the second half?\r\n Is it distribution? Is it something with the categories with new launches? How how you're thinking about it. And then as you think about the adjusted EBITDA as we go through the year, any puts and takes, we should be mindful of. Thank you.\n\nCarla Vernon\n\nI think what Dana is great to hear you. Thanks for joining us today. This is Karla. I think we will take those in two parts. Let me start out by talking about how we think about our overall growth road map. I would say this all still fits within the context of and you can see in our investor presentation on page 9, we really articulate our journey over the course of a few years, right. And so 2023 was absolutely defined as a transformation year for us. We I think we've been really candid about that and hard at work and proud of those results. We still believe in 2024, there are some activities that we want to continue in the vein of our three pillars, our brand maximization pillar, our margin enhancement pillar and our operating discipline pillar. And as we do that, that will mean that we're still really helping to drive a very strong and stable foundation of our core portfolio. We I've talked to you before about our real strong belief in the pro rata principle in any CPG company and that every CPG brand you look at has this sort of stable of core items that really really make or break the portfolio?\r\n We call those our hero items. We really only defined that strategy as a beginning strategy in 2023.\r\n As we look at those Hero items, I know that my that our Chief Growth Officer, Kate, who's here today, is absolutely reflecting on where are the growth opportunities you might also in this slide, and we've talked to you before, many of our hero items are very well under distributed, even though we know that they are so popular, for example, are extremely exciting. Mascara can never stop talking about it. I'm having a great last day when I choose to put on my primary and then my extreme lengthening, and that's the bad that the consumer loves that also, right? It's the number one timing, Climate Pledge friendly mascara in all of Amazon and yet its distribution remains less than half of all stores that we play in. So we do believe that distribution in all of its forms, it is going to be a very rewarding journey for us not only this year, not only next year, but a company like ours has a long runway for growth on distribution and that some of those distribution efforts will be against new items and some of those distribution efforts will be against Hero items. We believe those are both levers we have to play in balance. So I think that the answer is you will see some of all of that from us because there's actually so much opportunity.\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nYes, I can touch on the adjusted EBITDA question, Tom, you know, there will be some puts and takes across the year. We're comfortable that the model is set up to deliver on a full year basis, the positive outcome that we've articulated, but in the very near term, some of the revenue pressures that that relate to inventory that was orders that were pulled into our fourth quarter will impact our first quarter. And so we want to call out that first quarter in particular will be a little more muted on the top line, and that would impact the bottom line opportunity for us. But but we do see the top line progressing and a positive way going through the balance of the year as Carla articulated those back half of the year opportunities. And really this is a reflection of setting up this. This model that we see developing our bottom line results growing faster than the top line. It's going to be a consistent gross margin expansion opportunity through it for us across the periods and an expense leverage as well. That will help get us to that adjusted EBITDA positive level.\n\nOperator\n\nDara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nHey, good afternoon, guys. So can we talk about the long-term EBITDA margin potential and what you guys are thinking looking out three to five years, obviously made some nice progress in 2023. But what do you think is a reasonable level looking out long term? And how do you think about the pace of improvement over the next few years?\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nAnd are, you know the algorithm that that we think is the best way to express the opportunity as Scott obviously, a function of the progress that we've made that we've demonstrated in 23 on the model that we believe is best to allow revenue gains to kind of flow through at a faster pace to the bottom line. And but it is what it's also balanced with what we think is things that are out of our control. The uncertainty of the macro environment pressures from the consumer that we might face. And and so we think that this model allows us to weather through any of those those periods that we might encounter those and it gives us the flexibility to be strategic over time with with that growth in the bottom line. And I think it's safe to say that it continually expanding margin from an adjusted EBITDA standpoint is what we're comfortable expressing at this time, given that we're still in the early stages of a transformation journey. And then as time goes through, I think you'll see that we can kind of deliver behind that.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nOkay. But maybe a more specific question leaving 2024. Are there big opportunities left from a cost perspective as you think about maximizing profit and driving longer-term profitability? And how do you think about that from a cost perspective after 2024?\n\nDavid Loretta\n\nAnd yes, I believe we definitely see continued cost savings opportunities beyond 2024 both within our supply chain, our cost structure of that products, we bring to market and maintaining a real vigilance on expense control pumps. So those are those are going to be aspects of opportunity beyond 2024. And I'll say we always benchmarked ourselves against other CPG companies out there and use use the opportunity that we see in those best, the best in class companies as guidance for us is what we can we can get to as well.\n\nDara Mohsenian\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Carla for any closing remarks.\n\nCarla Vernon\n\nWell, on behalf of the entire ICE team or as we like to call them our butterfly family. We are so thankful that you dialed in today to join us for our fourth quarter and full year results. And we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

        "content": "Board members at Nvidia— the AI company no one can stop talking about that is at the forefront of the tech evolution—are reaping the benefits of a runup in the company’s stock. Shares in the company traded at $887 today, up 26.5% this month alone.\n\nFour insiders sold holdings via multiple transactions in the past four weeks, SEC filings show. They joined a growing list of executives who have unloaded billions in company stock in recent months. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon logged his first-ever stock sale last month to the tune of $150 million, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold $8.5 billion in Amazon stock. Meta Platforms founder Mark Zuckerberg sold $1.2 billion and private equity founder Leon Black made his first-ever sale worth $172.8 million.\n\nOn the Nvidia board, Tench Coxe, former managing director at venture capital investment firm Sutter Hill Ventures, sold $170 million in company stock in three transactions yesterday. As a director, Coxe earns restricted stock valued at $255,000 annually and $85,000 in cash. Coxe has been an Nvidia board member since 1993.\n\nSimilarly, board member Mark Stevens offloaded 12,000 shares of stock worth $10.2 million this week after shedding 15,000 shares last month, worth about $12 million. Stevens is managing partner at private family office investment firm S-Cubed Capital and was previously a partner at VC investment company Sequoia Capital. Stevens was a director from 1993 to 2006 and rejoined the board in 2008. Stevens previously sold 36,000 shares in January when the stock was about $546 for about $19.7 million.\n\nAnother board member, Mark Perry, sold 15,000 shares for about $11.9 million on Feb. 23, just two days after the company reported earnings on Feb. 21. Perry has been a director for nearly a decade and is a consultant for nonprofits and former CEO at biopharmaceutical company Aerovance.\n\nHarvey Jones, a longtime director who also joined the board in 2003, carved off a portion of his stake in the company for about $53 million. Jones is managing partner of Square Wave Ventures.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite their sales, Coxe, Jones, Stevens and Perry still have significant stakes in the AI chip developer. Coxe holds around 4.1 million shares, Jones holds nearly a million shares, Perry holds 152,000 and Stevens holds 4.4 million shares. CEO Jensen Huang holds about 86 million shares in the company, a 3.5% stake.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy sold 50,000 shares in Amazon this week for about $9 million. His sale was made as part of a trading plan set up in advance.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been on a hot streak over the past year or so, and that trend shows little signs of slowing.\n\nIt isn't just average investors that are bullish on these developments. Billionaires, venture capital firms, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have AI fever -- and one start-up in particular is attracting a lot of attention. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSome of the biggest names in technology\n\nFigure AI is working on a humanoid robot -- dubbed Figure 01 -- that has attracted a lot of attention. It was founded by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, who also founded Archer Aviation -- an aerospace company working on an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\n\nMeet Figure 01 pic.twitter.com/mQa2b59Vju\n\n-- Figure (@Figure_robot) October 18, 2023\n\nIn its most recent funding round, the start-up attracted financing from billionaire Jeff Bezos and Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood, as well as Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and AI wunderkind OpenAI -- the start-up that arguably kicked off the AI revolution. Figure AI raised roughly $675 million, which valued the start-up at roughly $2.6 billion.\n\nFigure AI developed an autonomous robot that can help alleviate labor shortages in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Just last week, Figure released a video to demonstrate its progress. It says these fields have 7 million unfilled jobs and not enough workers to fill them. Figure recently announced its first commercial agreement to supply BMW with general-purpose robots for automotive production.\n\nHow can investors get in on the action?\n\nIt might be difficult for investors to invest directly in Figure AI, as the start-up is privately held, but they can invest indirectly. For example, Microsoft is among the largest investors at $95 million, so buying shares of Microsoft will get you indirect exposure to Figure AI, though a very small amount.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there are plenty of other reasons to buy Microsoft to take part in the AI revolution.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "By Sam Tobin\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Amazon lost an appeal on Wednesday against a ruling that it had infringed UK trademarks by targeting British consumers on its U.S. website, in a potentially significant judgment for other online retailers.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant was found in 2022 by London's Court of Appeal to have infringed the trademarks. Amazon appealed last year to the United Kingdom's Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled that its U.S. website was \"targeting consumers in the UK\".\n\nAmazon declined to comment on \"ongoing proceedings\".\n\nIntellectual property lawyers said the ruling could affect all online retailers, who would now need to check that their platforms do not automatically target British consumers.\n\nAmazon was first sued in London by Lifestyle Equities, the owner of the UK and European trademarks in the \"Beverly Hills Polo Club\" brand, in 2019. Its trademarks cover a wide variety of goods, including clothing, luggage, watches and perfume.\n\nLifestyle Equities said Amazon had infringed its trademarks by selling U.S. branded goods to British consumers via its U.S. website, which Amazon denied.\n\nThe Supreme Court said in Wednesday's ruling that Amazon's U.S. website automatically contains boxes stating \"Deliver to United Kingdom\" when it detects a user is based in the UK.\n\nThis meant, the court said, that \"Amazon did target the UK as a destination for the U.S. branded goods\", where the product was marked as available for delivery to the UK.\n\nLifestyle Equities is entitled to an injunction preventing further infringement and potentially damages, the court ruled.\n\nJemma Green, an intellectual property (IP) lawyer at Addleshaw Goddard, said online retailers would have to audit their platforms to avoid risking any infringement.\n\nThe ruling meant brand owners have \"far stronger rights to prevent website operators based outside the UK from targeting UK consumers\", Green added.\n\nStory continues\n\nDennis Lee, an IP partner at BDB Pitmans, said the ruling could prompt similar lawsuits against other online retailers.\n\nAny website offering shipping to the UK \"will now need to be clear that it is not 'targeting' UK shoppers\", he said, or if it does be sure that the goods do not infringe UK trademarks.\n\n(This story has been corrected to spell the name as Jemma, not Jenna, in paragraph 10)\n\n(Reporting by Sam Tobin; Editing by Alexander Smith)",

        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. After oscillating between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all climbed to record highs in 2024.\n\nThough there have been select pockets of strength fueling this surge in the broader market, Wall Street's gains primary fall on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have powered the broader market higher\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to seven of the largest and most-influential businesses that have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over an extended stretch. These seven stocks are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAs noted, these stocks have run circles around the S&P 500 for quite some time. MSFT Chart\n\nBut what they've really brought to the table for investors is sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in various aspects of their operations.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the world's leading desktop operating system, while Azure accounts for a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spending, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Apple's ongoing innovation has given the iPhone a commanding market share lead among smartphones in the United States. The former largest company in the world also boasts the beefiest share repurchase program on the planet. Nvidia's has become the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for up to a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. Further, Amazon Web Services tops Microsoft's Azure as the leading global provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google is a practical monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure provider, and YouTube is the second most-visited social site. Meta Platforms oversees the top social media assets, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Meta's family of apps attracted close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the first automaker to build itself from the ground up to mass-production in over a half-century. It's also the only pure-play EV maker generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven companies could differ greatly. As we motor into March, one Magnificent Seven stock stands out as a bargain hiding in plain sight, while another highflier is liable to contend with mounting headwinds.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in March: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven long-term outperformers listed above, the most-attractive Magnificent Seven stock for opportunistic investors in March is Alphabet.\n\nIf Alphabet can be faulted for anything, it's being a cyclical company. Last year, 76% of the company's $86.3 billion in net sales were traced back to advertising. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's practically a given that businesses would pare back their ad budgets. At the moment, a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators do signal a high likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, economic cycles aren't even. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, there have been two periods of growth that sustained for longer than a decade. Advertising-driven businesses like Alphabet (and Meta, since we're discussing the Magnificent Seven) are primed for long-term upside as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nThere's no question that Alphabet's internet search segment Google is its foundation. A nearly 92% share of worldwide search makes Google the undisputed company businesses are going to seek out for ad placement in order to target consumers. More often than not, Alphabet should enjoy exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut as I've noted in the past, the Alphabet growth story is about far more than just its dominant internet search engine. Google Cloud has gobbled up about 10% of the global cloud infrastructure service market. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its relatively early stages, which suggests this segment can grow by a sustained double-digit pace.\n\nWhat's more, Google Cloud delivered its first year of operating profits in 2023 after multiple years of losses. Cloud services consistently boast higher margins than advertising, which suggests Alphabet's cash flow growth is set to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nYouTube is a beast, too. Daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds), which were introduced in 2021, have catapulted from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to more than 50 billion in early 2023. This should help the company draw in advertisers, as well as boost high-margin subscriptions to YouTube.\n\nLastly, Alphabet remains historically inexpensive. Since Alphabet reinvests a lot of what it generates from its operations, cash flow is the best metric to value the company. Investors can buy Alphabet shares right now for a little over 12 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which is a 31% discount to its trailing-five-year cash flow multiple.

Among the seven most-influential companies driving Wall Street higher over the past year and change, it's semiconductor stock Nvidia that should be avoided like the plague.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has enjoyed ample competitive advantages in the AI arena. GPU scarcity has driven prices of its A100 and H100 chips to the moon, which in turn allowed the company to more than double its sales last year. While Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, the company is set to face headwinds galore.\n\nOne of Nvidia's biggest problems is itself. As supply chain issues ease and Nvidia expands production of its A100 and H100 GPUs to meet more demand, scarcity of GPUs will decline. Price-driven scarcity accounted for the bulk of Nvidia's sales gains last year, as evidenced by cost of revenue declining through the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). As Nvidia expands production, it'll likely cannibalize its own margins.\n\nNvidia will also have competition coming at it from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices is stepping up the rollout of its MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel is set to begin fulfilling orders for its Gaudi3 AI-GPU later this year.\n\nThe real concern is that many of Nvidia's biggest customers are also developing AI data center chips of their own. This includes Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, which account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's sales. Not only is it highly unlikely that these four companies will sustain recent purchase activity from Nvidia, but the AI chips they're developing will lessen future reliance on the current AI kingpin.\n\nRegulators aren't doing Nvidia any favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of high-powered AI chips to China. This includes AI GPUs that Nvidia had developed specifically for the world's No. 2 economy after regulators initially clamped down on exports. Regulators could be costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nFollowing the money of company insiders is another reason to avoid Nvidia like the plague. While there have been plenty of sales, there hasn't been a single insider purchase in more than three years. Insiders only buy for one reason: they believe the stock will head higher. If they aren't adding, why should you?\n\nBut maybe the biggest concern for Nvidia and its shareholders is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption of new technology and innovation; and it appears to be happening in real time, once again.\n\nNvidia is valued at close to 34 times its trailing-12-month sales, which is a valuation reminiscent of Cisco Systems during the height of the dot-com bubble. This makes Nvidia an interesting story stock, but one to avoid like the plague for investment purposes in March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Upside to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia shares skyrocketed 263% over the past year amid a flurry of excitement about artificial intelligence (AI). But Wall Street isn't counting on an encore performance over the next year. In fact, analysts see Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Atlassian(NASDAQ: TEAM) as better AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia carries a median 12-month price target of $850 per share, implying 3% upside from its current price of $823 per share. But Amazon's median price target of $205 per share implies 15% upside from its current price of $178 per share. And Atlassian's median price target of $255 per share implies 22% upside from its current price of $209 per share.\n\nThat does not mean Nvidia is a bad investment. Those price targets are educated guesses about what might happen in the next 12 months. Even if Nvidia underperforms during that time period, the stock could still outperform over the next five years. But investors shouldn't fixate on one AI stock. The most prudent way to benefit is to spread money across multiple AI stocks.\n\nWith that in mind, Amazon and Atlassian warrant further consideration.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported strong results in the fourth quarter, pairing impressive top-line growth with improved profitability. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion due to momentum in retail and advertising services, and a sequential acceleration in cloud computing revenue. The company also reported GAAP net income of $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year.\n\nInvestors can expect similar momentum in the future given that Amazon is a major player in three quickly growing markets: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing.\n\nSpecifically, the company operates the most popular online marketplace as measured by monthly visitors. Amazon is the third-largest ad tech company worldwide. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is executing on a sensible growth strategy that could drive share gains across all three businesses. In e-commerce, the company recently transitioned from a national fulfillment network to regional hubs that reduce costs and hasten delivery times. In digital advertising, Amazon recently introduced a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automates marketing content creation for brands. And in cloud computing, the company is leaning into growing demand for AI with new products like Bedrock, CodeWhisperer, and Amazon Q.\n\nTo elaborate, Bedrock is a cloud service that streamlines the development of generative AI applications. CodeWhisperer is an AI-enabled coding companion that helps developers work more productively. And Amazon Q is an AI-enabled business assistant that automates a wide variety of tasks, from drafting social media posts to summarizing information.\n\nGoing forward, online retail sales are expected to increase at 8% annually through 2030, while ad tech and cloud services revenue is projected to grow at 14% annually during the same period. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five years.\n\nAgainst that consensus estimate, the current valuation of 3.2 time sales appears reasonable. Long-term investors should consider buying a small position in this growth stock right now.\n\n2. Atlassian\n\nThe difficult macroeconomic environment has weighed on Atlassian, but encouraging financial results in the second quarter suggest the headwinds are diminishing. Revenue increased 21% to $1 billion and non-GAAP net income increased 65% to $189 million. Management also said free-to-paid customer conversions stabilized and customers added paid seats more quickly. Unfortunately, the stock dropped sharply following the report as investors reacted (or possibly overreacted) to cautious guidance.\n\nArtificial intelligence could be a material tailwind for Atlassian in the coming years. The company sells work management and IT service management software that helps organizations plan, track, and complete projects, especially complex projects like the development of AI applications. On that front, Atlassian is well positioned to capitalize on demand given its status as a leader in enterprise service management and enterprise agile planning software.\n\nAdditionally, Atlassian has introduced a suite of AI features called Atlassian Intelligence. It lets users draft text, summarize information, surface insights, and automate tasks across its platform with natural language. The company also integrated virtual agent technology into its IT service management software to automate IT support interactions. Those features not only create new monetization opportunities, but also make existing products more compelling. Michael Cannon-Brookes, co-founder and co-CEO, said Atlassian Intelligence had a \"fantastic customer reception.\"\n\nAtlassian said its software addressed a $29 billion market growing at 14% annually in 2022, implying a market opportunity that now exceeds $37 billion. Wall Street analysts expect the company to grow sales at 22% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate is sensible given the tailwinds behind the business, and it makes the current valuation of 13.8 times sales appear reasonable. Investors should consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Target Reports A Better-Than-Expected Holiday Quarter And Announces Paid Membership Program To Rival Amazon And Walmart",
        "content": "On Tuesday, Target (NYSE: TGT) reported its holiday quarter results, with both top and bottom lines surpassing Wall Street estimates. Despite guiding for another year of weak sales, Target was rewarded for boosting its profit and margins with its shares jumping 12% during morning trading. Moreover, Target unveiled a paid membership program to combat its rivals, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Results\n\nFor the period ended on February 3rd, revenue grew nearly 2% to $31.92 billion due to a boost from an additional week of sales compared to last year’s comparable quarter, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $31.83 billion.\n\nNet income expanded by nearly 58% to $1.38 billion, or $2.98 per share, significantly surpassing Target’s own forecast that was in the range between $1.90 and $2.60 per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $2.98 per share, also surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $2.42 per share.\n\nOperating income margin rate also improved from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 3.7% to 5.8%. However, comparable sales, both in stores and online, dropped 5.4% YoY. Online sales contracted 0.7% YoY but still improved from the third quarter’s 6% drop. With the sales recovery of Target.com, Target succeeded to surpass the analyst estimate of a 4.6% decline in comparable sales with total comparable sales falling 4.4%. Physical traffic also improved as more shoppers used curbside pickup, from third quarter’s 4.7% decline to 1.7% decline.\n\nTarget Circle 360 To Combat Amazon And Walmart\n\nTarget announced its plans to launch its paid membership program next month. Like its rivals, Amazon and Walmart, Target will offer its shoppers same-day delivery. The minimum order threshold for the unlimited same day delivery will be on par with the membership offering of Walmart and its Walmart Plus program. For the initial cost of $49 per year, members will also be offered automatic discounts and personalized deals. The program will be launched on April 7th.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Better-Than-Expected Fourth Quarter To End A Challenging Year\n\nAfter significant pandemic-fueled gains, Target’s sales were sluggish over the past two years, reflecting a customer pullback in discretionary spending. Last month, even its much bigger rival that weathered inflation much better than others, Walmart, said it observed that inflation is forcing shoppers to hunt for value even on everyday goods, despite also seeing sings of discretionary spending pickup up. Over the past few quarters, Target was also hit by increased levels of theft as well as a backlash to its Pride month collection. Target was cautious with its holiday quarter outlook and it opted for the same approach, but it is expecting its membership program and product launches to result in this year’s sales recovery.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 14 countries with Costco in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the retail sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Countries with Costco in the World.\n\nRetail corporations serve as a vital link between manufacturers and end consumers, providing a platform for product sales while also contributing greatly to economic growth. In one of our previous articles, we saw that it was two retail companies, namely Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which ranked at the top on our list of the largest companies in the world by revenue.\n\nBefore we delve into the countries that have the most Costco warehouses and stores in the world, let’s take a look at the global retail industry and what is going on at Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nA Quick Look at the Global Retail Market\n\nOffering goods and services to consumers worldwide through various channels, the global retail market plays a crucial role in driving economies. According to a report by IMARC Group, the global retail market was estimated to have reached a value of $28.51 trillion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.54% from 2024 to 2032 to reach a value of $46.3 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. The surge in online shopping, technological advancements, and changing consumer behaviors are some of the key trends creating a positive outlook for the global retail industry.\n\nRetail corporations and businesses continue to adapt to trends like retail therapy, digital transformation, and sustainability to attract customers and stay competitive in this dynamic and evolving landscape. In addition to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), two other key players within the global retail market include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nTechnological innovations in the retail industry, including Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR), are also expected to influence the retail market positively during the forecast period. There is also a strong demand for personalized and convenient shopping experiences. On February 2, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introduced Rufus, a new generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant. Trained using Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) vast product database, web data, customer feedback, and community Q&As, Rufus will provide users with a conversational shopping experience. It will assist customers by answering queries on various shopping needs and products, offering comparisons, and providing recommendations based on the ongoing conversation. While Rufus has been launched in beta to a small subset of customers in Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) mobile app, it will be made available to more US customers in the coming weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nRetail corporations are focusing on delivering exceptional services and innovative solutions to meet the diverse needs of their vast customer bases. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of grocery stores, hypermarkets, and discount department stores in the US. It also owns and operates Sam’s Club, a chain of membership-only warehouse club retail stores that provide members with exclusive savings and quality merchandise. On January 9, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced that Sam's Club has introduced a new technology that uses AI and computer vision to eliminate the need for members to wait in line for receipt verification at the exit. This innovation is part of the company's ongoing efforts to enhance the member experience and differentiate itself as a segment innovator. Deployed in the exit area of the club, this technology captures images of carts and verifies payment for all items within a member’s basket. The technology is currently being piloted in 10 Sam's Club locations. With AI constantly learning and enhancing, the company aims to improve the technology and expand it to its nearly 600 clubs by the end of 2024.\n\nRetail Giants: Unveiling Costco's Success\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational corporation that operates an international chain of membership warehouses.

Earnings were better than expected driven by better gross margin. Same store sales were 3.9% with solid traffic. Costco also noted better discretionary trends and solid seasonal sales.”\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is focusing on opening new stores and warehouses worldwide, continuing its growth trajectory by expanding its global footprint. This strategic move aims to drive higher revenues and market penetration, reflecting the corporation's commitment to sustained expansion and market dominance.\n\nWith regards to its expansion plans, here are some more comments from Costco Wholesale Corporation’s (NASDAQ:COST) Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“In terms of warehouse expansion in the first quarter, we opened 10 locations, including one relo (ph), so a net of nine increases. That -- those nine included eight in the U.S. and one in Canada. For the full year fiscal '24, we estimate opening -- we're planning to open 33 locations, including two relos, so for a net increase of 31 new warehouses that would be up from 23 that we opened in fiscal '23.\n\nFor Q2 fiscal '24, we plan four new locations, including our sixth building in China, are early in the calendar year.”\n\nNow that we have discussed what’s going on at Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) and the global retail market, let’s take a look at 14 countries with Costco in the world. 14 Countries with Costco in the World\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article, we have listed the 14 countries with Costco in the world.

        "content": "Facebook's services are among those affected - Dado Ruvic/Reuters\n\nUsers of YouTube and Facebook experienced disruption this afternoon, with hundreds of thousands of users reporting problems.\n\nIssues began around 3pm, with the outage affecting Facebook and Instagram, which are owned by Meta, and YouTube, which is owned by Google. The outages have been tracked by the website Downdetector.\n\nAt 5:19pm, Meta announced that the outage affecting its services was now over. Google told The Telegraph that it “saw a surge in traffic ... and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.”\n\nLondon-based internet monitoring firm Netblocks said that four Meta platforms - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Threads - were “experiencing outages related to login sessions in multiple countries.”\n\nBut the firm, which advocates for internet freedom, said there was no sign of “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, which are typically imposed by governments.\n\nAccording to a Google status website, there were also reports of problems with some of its services aimed at advertisers.\n\nIt is understood that the outages were not caused by a cyberattack.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:32 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today. Chris and I will be back tomorrow to cover all the latest Budget news and analyst.

Companies could use Greensill to borrow money to pay suppliers early, but companies it had lent money to had defaulted.\n\nIts failure also led to questions over lobbying by Lord Cameron, now the Foreign Secretary, who had pushed for Greensill to gain access to the Covid-19 loans scheme.\n\nLord Cameron was found by the Commons Treasury select committee not to have broken any rules by advocating for Greensill.\n\n05:42 PM GMT\n\nGoogle says it has ‘scaled up’ services to combat issues\n\nA Google spokesperson has told The Telegraph:\n\nWe saw a surge in traffic starting around 7:25am Pacific Time [3:25pm in the UK] on March 5, and we scaled up our systems to serve the additional load.\n\n05:37 PM GMT\n\nFacebook says outage over\n\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook owner Meta, has said:\n\nEarlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nDanske Bank said the “huge success” of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk’s jabs, which include Wegovy and Ozempic, led to GDP growth of 1.8pc in Denmark last year. Without the company, the Danish economy would have contracted slightly in 2023.\n\nThe stellar performance of the drug maker pushed “overall activity levels up, while much of the rest of industry and housing construction have contracted”.\n\nAnalysts wrote: “Denmark is in a stagnation similar to its neighbours but with the addition of Novo Nordisk, which in itself is causing a manufacturing boom large enough to lift GDP growth by almost 2 percentage points last year.”\n\nNovo Nordisk is worth around $436bn (£344bn), making it more valuable than what the entire Danish economy produces in a year. It is currently the largest European listed company, having overtaken luxury giant LVMH last year.\n\nThe company’s shares have surged over 70pc over the last 12 months amid a boom in demand for its weight-loss jab Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes drug which is used off-label to treat obesity.\n\nSales of its weight-loss and diabetes treatments ballooned by 38pc in 2023 to hit DKK 215bn (£24bn). Novo Nordisk is now making around £32m a day in profits.\n\nHigh levels of demand are expected to continue and help the Danish economy grow even faster this year. Danske Bank more than doubled its forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 from 1pc to 2.1pc. The injectable drug Ozempic has contributed to Danish economic growth - David J.

The biggest faller was industrial equipment rental company Ashtead, down 9.36pc, followed by components supplier RS Group, down 3.51pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.11pc. The biggest riser was Spirent Communications, up 63.28pc, followed by Trustpilot, up 8.38pc.

Meanwhile, Google’s Ad Manager is experiencing “service disruption”, according to its official status page, while Google is “investigating reports of an issue” with its AdMob and AdSense services.

Shares in Wincanton fell 4.5pc to 596p.\n\nThe business was founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, later known as Cow & Gate.\n\nToday its main business is running warehouses and transporting goods for the likes of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Morrisons and Waitrose.\n\n04:14 PM GMT\n\nEvery little helps as Tesco hikes shop workers’ pay\n\nTesco is to increase store workers’ pay by 9.1pc in an act worth roughly £300m.\n\nIt is the latest supermarket group to lift pay levels for workers ahead of the rise in the national minimum wage in April.\n\nThe national minimum wage will increase from its current rate of £10.42 per hour to £11.44 on April 1.\n\nThe grocery giant, which employs more than 330,000 people across the UK, will raise the basic hourly rate for store workers from £11.02 per hour to £12.02.\n\nIt will also increase the pay of workers within the M25 to £13.15 per hour, from a current rate of £11.95 for those in inner London and £11.75 for those in outer London.\n\nTesco UK chief executive Matthew Barnes said:\n\nThis represents another significant investment in our colleagues, building on the last two years of investment.\n\nWe recognise the amazing work our colleagues do every day in serving our customers and we’re really proud to offer such competitive rates of pay alongside a great range of exclusive colleague benefits.\n\nIt comes days after rival Asda said it will increase its basic rate of staff pay to £12.04 per hour later this year.

It’s not for me to reveal today what might be in the Budget tomorrow but I would say there’s record numbers of police officers, record numbers of doctors, record numbers of nurses.”\n\nI think a responsible budget will be making sure the country and economy continues to recover from the pandemic, from Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the spike in inflation that we’ve had to deal with, and I think that means continuing to put record amount of funding into public services while still giving the British people, I think, a bit of a tax break this year as well.\n\n09:02 AM GMT\n\nGoogle employee accuses head of Israel arm of ‘powering genocide’\n\nGoogle’s head of Israel was accused by an employee of overseeing technology that is “powering genocide” as he was interrupted during a speech at a conference.\n\nBarak Regev, the managing director of Google Israel, stopped speaking as a man identifying himself as a cloud engineer for the US tech giant stood up and criticised its Project Nimbus cloud computing work for the Israeli government and its military.\n\nAnnounced April 2021, the Israeli Finance Ministry said the $1.2bn project is to provide “the government, the defense establishment, and others with an all-encompassing cloud solution.”\n\nCritics have argued the technology allows Israel to collect unlawful data on Palestinians and to increase surveillance.\n\nVideo shared on social media shows Mr Regev addressing the MindTheTech conference in New York before a man stands up and identifies himself as a Google cloud software engineer.\n\nWatch what he shouts below:\n\nA Google Cloud engineer just interrupted Google Israel managing director Barak Regev at Israeli tech industry conference MindTheTech this morning in NY.\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to build technology that powers genocide!\" he yelled, referring to Google's Project Nimbus contract pic.twitter.com/vM9mMFlJRS\n\n— Caroline Haskins (@car0linehaskins) March 4, 2024\n\n08:42 AM GMT\n\nFTSE 100 slumps as China stimulus fails to impress\n\nBritain’s blue-chip stock index fell to a near-three week low as it was dragged down by Ashtead Group and commodity-linked shares.\n\nThe FTSE 100 slipped 0.3pc to touch its lowest level since February 16.\n\nShares of commodity majors such as BP, Shell and Glencore fell about a per cent each as oil and metal prices dipped after investors were unimpressed by pledges by China to transform its economy amid stuttering growth since the pandemic.\n\nAshtead dropped 6.7pc and was the biggest loser in the FTSE 100 after the British equipment rental firm forecast full-year group rental revenue at the lower end of 11pc-13pc growth range.\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250 index was flat.\n\nShares of Spirent Communications rocketed by 58.7pc after US-based communications equipment firm Viavi Solutions agreed to buy the British company in a deal valued at about £1bn.\n\nInchcape fell 9.3pc to the bottom of the midcap index after the car dealership said it expects “moderated growth” in the short term.\n\n08:17 AM GMT\n\nMirror publisher’s profits tumble after job cuts\n\nThe publisher of the Mirror and Express newspapers has seen its profits tumble by a third after rolling out sweeping job cuts.\n\nOur reporter James Warrington has the latest:\n\nReach posted a statutory operating profit of £46.1m in 2023, down more than 35pc on the previous year.\n\nThis was largely driven by restructuring charges after the company cut around 800 roles as part of a wider cost-cutting drive.

Sales and profits have both risen, despite significant cost inflation, and the group is returning more cash to shareholders through dividends. All in all, an impressive performance.\n\nThere is no doubt Greggs’ brand is resonating strongly with the UK consumer and is in fine fettle. A record 220 new shop openings and longer opening hours have also extended the brand’s reach, contributing to market share gains.\n\nThis sales growth has enabled Greggs to continue increasing profits despite significant inflation in the cost of raw materials, energy and wages. Encouragingly, these cost pressures are now beginning to ease. This is good news for profit margins, as well as consumer demand as it should reduce the need for price increases.\n\nKey to Greggs’ success is doing the simple things well. Its supply chain and infrastructure are top notch. Its operational execution is invariably flawless. And it is continually improving the offering.\n\nOverall, the future looks bright for Greggs and 2024 should be another year of progress.\n\n07:30 AM GMT\n\nGreggs reveals record year for profits and new stores\n\nHigh street bakery chain Greggs has cheered a record annual performance as it notched up a 27pc hike in full-year profits, but revealed slowing sales growth.\n\nThe group reported pre-tax profits of £188.3m in 2023, up from £148.3m the previous year after like-for-like sales in company-managed shops rose 13.7pc.\n\nIt saw sales growth slow to 9.4pc in the final three months of the year as there was less contribution from price inflation.\n\nThe group added that comparable store sales growth slowed further, to 8.2pc in the first nine weeks of 2024.\n\nBut the company said it was “confident that Greggs can deliver another year of good progress” and remains on track to open between 140 to 160 shops this year after opening a record 220 shops in 2023.

        "content": "The stock market offers many opportunities for people who want to become millionaires. Investments in corporations can grow much faster than the funds in a savings account. Some stocks can soar quickly to the point where you can retire off of them.\n\nInvestors have seen this happen firsthand with several stocks. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are two successful stocks that come to mind. These stocks have exceptional 5-year gains, but some investors may believe they have missed out on those opportunities.\n\nHowever, if you expand your time horizons and focus on reliable companies, it’s possible to become a 401k millionaire. Let’s examine three retirement stocks that can help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) makes money every time its customers use their credit and debit cards. The company has established a robust business model and is poised to become a $1 trillion company within a few years. Currently, the stock has a $570 billion market cap and is up by more than 90% over the past five years.\n\nTruly, Visa benefits from rising consumer spending. If the economy is healthy, Visa will continue to deliver good results as it did in Q1 2024. During that quarter, revenue increased by 9% year over year (YOY) while net income jumped by 17% YOY.\n\nThose growth rates help support a dividend program that exhibits meaningful dividend hikes each year. While the 0.73% yield is low, Visa raised its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.52 per share in 2023. The company has regularly maintained a double-digit growth rate each year and has more than doubled its dividend from 2019 to 2023.\n\nInvestors planning for retirement don’t have to focus on current yields. The high cash flow is likely to be there by the time you need to use this stock to fund your living expenses. In the meantime, Visa’s stock price stands to grow in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers great value for investors as a company that seems as if it’s doing everything right for its business. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot sector, and Microsoft recently doubled down by introducing Copilot for Finance. It’s part of the company’s continued efforts to become an AI leader within the industry.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft is far more than an AI stock. The corporation has exposure to many verticals, but none of them are as important as Microsoft Cloud. This business segment made up $33.7 billion of the company’s $62.0 billion in Q2 FY24 revenue. Also, Microsoft Cloud revenue was up by 24% YOY and helped the company grow by 18% YOY.\n\nThat’s an impressive growth rate for a large tech company. Net income followed with a 33% YOY improvement. Microsoft will be around for many years and continually expanding into additional industries as opportunities arise. The company is well-run, and just like Visa, it offers a low dividend yield with a high annual growth rate.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) isn’t going anywhere. The retailer offers affordable products, and lower prices will always be a big draw. Investors pouring money into their 401k plans want stability and the confidence that their money will grow. Walmart checks off both requirements.\n\nRecently, the company posted 5.7% YOY revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. In a show of confidence, Walmart also hiked its annual dividend by 9%. While most people know the company for its retail, a few segments stand out.\n\nAnd, e-commerce sales increased by 23% YOY which will help the company take some market share from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Furthermore, the company’s global advertising business grew by an impressive 33% YOY. Finally, Walmart’s recent acquisition of Vizio will help its ad segment.\n\nCurrently, WMT trades at a 31 P/E ratio. Shares have gained 25% over the past year and are up by 81% over the past five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "content": "Larry Fink, who founded BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, in 1988 (initially under the purview of Blackstone), currently has a net worth of $1.2 billion. He serves as the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, which currently manages $8.7 trillion in total assets.\n\nFink has been a long-time advocate of equities investment, recommending investors put at least 80% of their total discretionary assets into equity investments or hard assets. Fink also stated that investors who have sufficient risk appetite could invest 100% of their total assets in equities.\n\nWhile Fink acknowledges the current macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds and their potential impact on the global equity market, the long-term trends are expected to remain positive, creating distinctive opportunities for investors.\n\n\"I think, you know, for a long-term investor, long-term view, who can tolerate market volatility, you should be at least 80 percent in equities or hard assets,\" Fink said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nLet's look at some of BlackRock's largest equity holdings.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is BlackRock's equity holding, accounting for 5.17% of the total portfolio. MSFT was one of the best-performing Magnificent Seven stocks in 2022, as the tech giant's strategic investments and acquisition plans reaped substantial earnings for the company. Year-to-date, shares of MSFT have gained nearly 10.5%.\n\nMicrosoft has been taking active steps to emerge as the market leader in the generative artificial intelligence (AI) space, as the company signed a 10-year strategic partnership agreement with British telecom company Vodafone Group last month.\n\nOver the next decade, Vodafone plans to allocate $1.5 billion towards the development of cloud and AI services focused on enhancing customer experiences in collaboration with Microsoft.\n\nAnalysts expect MSFT's revenues to increase 15.2% year-over-year to $60.86 billion in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ending March). The consensus EPS estimate of $2.83 for the ongoing quarter indicates a 15.5% improvement from the same period last year. Wall Street analysts expect MSFT's EPS to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3% over the next five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Wedbush and Barclays have an \"Outperform\" rating on MSFT with a price target of $475, indicating a potential upside of up to 15%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Check out the latest investment opportunities added to its platform.\n\nAmazon\n\nBlackRock holds approximately 627.17 million shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), accounting for roughly 2.42% of the total portfolio. The world's largest e-commerce player was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) on Feb 26, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance, reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy.\n\nAmazon is currently working on raising fees levied on businesses that sell their products on the platform, which could significantly increase its profit margins. The company generated $140 billion in revenues from sellers' fees in 2023, accounting for nearly 25% of the online retailer's total revenues.\n\nAmazon's net sales grew 14% year-over-year to $170 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, which ended Dec. 31, 2023. \"This Q4 was a record-breaking holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made a robust comeback in fiscal 2023 after a disappointing 2022. The company's focus on AI has driven its success last year, as it launched Llama 2, a state-of-the-art large language model for coding. Meta's founder and CEO highlighted last year as the year of efficiency for the company. BlackRock holds over 157 million shares of META, accounting for 1.42% of its total portfolio.\n\nMeta's revenues increased 25% year-over-year to $40.11 billion in fiscal 2023, while its net income rose 201% from the same period last year to $14.02 billion last year.\n\nFollowing its stellar earnings report, Meta authorized its first-ever dividend payment of $0.50 per share on Feb 1, pushing the stock to gain over 14% intraday. The company also authorized a share repurchase agreement of approximately 5% of the total outstanding shares and currently has nearly $31 billion earmarked for this purpose.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "title": "Stock Splits 2024: 3 Stocks That Could Follow in Walmart’s Footsteps",
        "content": "Walmart (NYSE:WMT) recently surprised the market by splitting its stock 3-for-1. That means for every one WMT share you own you will now have three. The announcement was the first time in over 20 years that the retailer split its shares. More stock splits in 2024 could be coming.\n\nFor those who don’t know a stock split is a corporate action where a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares to boost the liquidity of the shares. Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value of the shares remains the same, meaning the split does not alter the company’s market capitalization. This action often makes the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors by reducing the price per share.\n\nBecause the purpose of the split was to make its stock more affordable for Walmart employees to buy, we may see more high-priced stocks follow suit. The three companies below are ripe for stock splits in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA) A digital image of a ticker tape reads \"STOCK SPLIT.\" REDU Stock stock split.\n\nSource: iQoncept/ShutterStock.com\n\nAt $554 a share, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is primed for a price cut via a stock split. The personal care and cosmetics retailer has grown to become the largest specialty beauty retailer in the U.S. with nearly 1,375 stores in all 50 states.\n\nUlta has been aggressive in returning value to shareholders. Although it doesn’t pay a dividend, the beauty retailer has been repurchasing shares. After the fiscal third quarter report, Ulta said it would buy back $950 million worth of shares instead of its previous guidance of $900 million worth of shares. A stock split would make ULTA stock as attainable as its makeup.\n\nBeauty supplies tend to be resilient in both good and bad economies. An affordable luxury, consumers will continue to buy such products despite hard times. There is even a name for it: the Lipstick Effect. Because consumers can’t afford to buy upscale goods they purchase smaller indulgences instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince its IPO in 2007, Ulta Beauty generated returns in excess of 1,603% versus a 239% return by the S&P 500. Bringing its stock down to an affordable luxury range would generate even greater investor interest in this high-growth company.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Stock splits, companies do exchange transactions to increase the number of shares by issuing more shares to current shareholders\n\nSource: Bakhtiar Zein / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) would be a perfect candidate for a stock split in 2024. The move would align with other tech stocks that split their shares two years ago. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) were among those splitting their stock then and the chipmaker can afford to do the same now. This makes it one of those potential stock splits for 2024.\n\nAt just under $1,400 per share, it is ready. AVGO stock is up 135% in the last 12 months and 412% over the last five years. The original Broadcom stock was founded in 1991 and split its shares on three separate occasions. It was acquired by Avago in 2016 but kept the Broadcom name (and the Avago ticker symbol). Since then, it hasn’t split shares at all.\n\nThe new Broadcom has been something of a serial acquirer itself, making numerous software acquisitions over the past few years. Among those were the software businesses from CA, Symantec, and Brocade. It most recently completed its acquisition of VMWare last November.\n\nBroadcom’s network and server solutions for data centers are optimized for artificial intelligence (AI). That blends well with the AI chips it is developing as well. AI is a fast-growing business and generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the company last quarter.\n\nBroadcom is well on its way toward trillion-dollar status and a stock split would make AVGO stock more accessible to all.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the cheapest stock of the three at only $415 a share but even it could split its shares. The company has nine other splits in its history, so it is not unheard of, but the last one was back in 2003. Since then, MSFT stock has grown 1,560% but including reinvested dividends would boost its total return to almost 2,600%. In comparison, the broad market index has but an 812% total return.\n\nThe company just delivered impressive second-quarter earnings. Sales surged 18% from the year-ago period to $62 billion as AI pervaded throughout all of its products and services now. CEO Satya Nadella says half of all Fortune 500 companies are using Microsoft’s Azure AI models now and the cloud services platform has grown to 53,000 AI customers.\n\nMicrosoft is the richest company on the market with a $3.1 trillion valuation. It ended its fiscal second quarter with $81 billion in cash. Profits of $22 billion were up 33% from last year. This is a tech stock firing on all cylinders. Investors ought to consider MSFT stock for their portfolios, no matter if it splits its stock or not.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million",
        "content": "In this piece, we are going to look at 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. If you want to skip our detailed analysis on the population dynamics of the world, and how declining birth rates are changing those dynamics, you can go directly to 5 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million.\n\nAlthough the world population sits healthy at 8 billion mark as of 2024, the global demographic landscape is undergoing a transformative shift, with declining birth rates playing a pivotal role in the discussion on overpopulation, especially in countries with numerous cities surpassing one million inhabitants.\n\nOver the past 70 years, countries worldwide have experienced a remarkable decrease in birth rates, which mirrors evolving societal norms and economic progress. Notably, nations like China and South Korea have witnessed a substantial decline in birth rates, dropping by over 80% since 1950. While declining birth rates signify advancement in socio-economic development and a shift towards prioritizing education and career over starting families, they also introduce challenges associated with an aging population and potential labor shortages.\n\nThe balance between low birth rates and overpopulation in cities presents complex scenarios, necessitating thoughtful urban planning and sustainable development strategies to address the strain on resources and social services. As the global fertility rate has declined significantly over the past five decades to 2.3, falling below the critical replacement level of 2.1, the implications of this demographic shift on overpopulation are increasingly pertinent.\n\nThe need for proactive measures to navigate the consequences of declining birth rates is crucial, ensuring a balanced approach to population dynamics, sustainable urban growth, and inclusive societal development. In the United States, the downward trend in birth rates has been notable, with a nearly 23% decrease since the Great Recession, highlighting the need for understanding the implications of this demographic transformation. Immediate attention and strategic interventions are essential to address the challenges posed by declining birth rates and to create a balanced equilibrium between low birth rates and the potential impacts of overpopulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nVarious industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, construction, retail, and services, have strong ties to densely populated countries. These sectors rely on factors like labor availability, access to resources, market demand, and robust infrastructure that are typically abundant in highly populated regions. So, before we move to our list of 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million, let’s look at how such global businesses are doing as of now. Namely, we are going to discuss Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), and Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA).\n\nPapa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)\n\nPapa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) Papa John's, a leading pizza provider, has capitalized on the expanding global population, recognizing the direct correlation between the food market and worldwide population growth. Recently, franchisees of Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) in North America made a strategic decision to elevate their contributions to the national marketing fund, aligning with a new marketing strategy set to launch in 2024. This initiative follows a comprehensive review of the brand's creative and media efforts in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Papa John's International, Inc. expanded its global presence by opening a net total of 45 restaurants in the third quarter, bringing the brand's worldwide unit count to 5,825 by the end of September 24, encompassing operations in North America and international markets. In 2023, Papa John's unveiled 210 new units, spanning North America and international regions, demonstrating the brand's commitment to strategic growth and market diversification.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon, a dominant player in e-commerce and digital streaming, leverages the global population growth to drive innovation in response to evolving market demands.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) experienced robust growth in net sales, with a 14% increase totaling $170.0 billion compared to the same quarter in 2022. Notably, the North America segment saw a 13% sales surge, reaching $105.5 billion, while international sales spiked by 17% to $40.2 billion. The impressive results were fueled by the successful holiday shopping season, featuring record-breaking events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, where customers worldwide purchased over 1 billion items, leading to substantial savings. These outcomes underscore Amazon's strong customer engagement and business expansion across diverse segments.\n\nKimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)\n\nRenowned for its innovative baby and child care products, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) reported modest growth in Personal Care sales, reaching $2.6 billion in the quarter ending 31st December 2023, showing a 2% increase. The company's success is attributed to advancements in innovation, effective commercial strategies, and supply chain enhancements, resulting in notable volume growth, particularly in North America with a 4% sales surge. Overall, the Personal Care segment displayed a 1% growth in 2023, with 5% organic sales growth, indicating widespread progress across regions. 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million\n\nA crowded Wall Street plaza, bustling with people carrying briefcases.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo construct our list of 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million, we referred to World Population Review’s dataset consisting of population of 802 cities of the world. From this data set, we extracted all the cities with population exceeding 1 million mark. Seeing which country each city belongs to, we came up with the number of cities of respective countries that have population greater than 1 million, and that’s how we came up with our list of 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Please note that the countries that stood equal with the number of cities exceeding 1 million mark population, we ranked those based on the accumulated population of the cities of the respective countries that exceed 1 million mark.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Thailand\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nIn 2023, Thailand's demographic profile showed a notable imbalance, with over 13 million individuals aged 60 and above, contrasting with fewer than 500,000 newborns. The population has experienced a decline of approximately 35,000 people over the past two years. If this downward trend persists, projections suggest that Thailand's current population of 66 million could decrease by more than half in under 50 years. Thailand makes it to our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million at 20th position. Bankok, Chon Buri and Songkhla are few cities in Thailand with population above 1 million mark.\n\n19. France\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nIn France, as of January 2023, the total population stands at 68.0 million, with a marginal increase of 0.3% in 2022. The total fertility rate in 2022 stood at 1.80 children per woman, down from 1.84 in 2021. This alarming trend requires immediate attention and action to address the implications for each respective country's demographics. Paris, Lilli and Lyon are three of the six cities in France with population above 1 million.\n\n18. Canada\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nCanada is 18th country on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Based on data from Statistics Canada, Canada's population has witnessed a significant surge, reaching an estimated 40,528,396 on October 1st, 2023, encompassing citizens and residents. This uptick corresponds to an additional 430,635 individuals, signaling a notable growth rate of 1.1% since July 1st, 2023. This growth marks the highest population increase observed in a quarter since the second quarter of 1957 when Canada's population expanded by 1.2%. During that period, Canada's population stood at 16.7 million, with growth largely attributed to post-war baby boom births and an influx of refugees following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa are few cities with population above 1 million.\n\n17. Vietnam\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nAccounting for roughly 13 million individuals, Generation Z, comprising individuals born between 1997 and 2012, constitutes approximately 19% of Vietnam's population. As of 2025, this demographic cohort is expected to represent about one-third of the country's workforce, making them key contributors to Vietnam's developmental trajectory. Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Can Tho are three of the biggest cities in terms of population in Vietnam.\n\n16. South Africa\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nJohannesburg, Cape Town and Ekurhuleni are 3 largest cities in terms of population size in South Africa.\n\nIn comparison to other BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), South Africa is relatively young, yet it is considered older by African standards. It is placed at 16th place on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Seniors make up 5.9% of South Africa's population, with children comprising 28.6%. To provide further context, Russia has 15.8% seniors and 17.2% children, while China's demographics include 13.7% seniors and 17.7% children. Within the sub-Saharan region, the average percentage of seniors stands at 3.0%, contrasted with 41.8% for children. These figures illustrate the demographic distribution and age profiles of various countries in different parts of the world.\n\n15. Colombia\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nColombia's total population is projected to steadily rise from 2023 to 2028, increasing by a total of 2.6 million individuals (+4.98%). With this growth trend continuing for the tenth consecutive year, the total population is expected to reach 54.78 million people, marking a new peak in 2028. The country has seen consistent population growth in recent years.\n\n14. Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nNumber of Cities: 7\n\nIn 2023, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is ranked as the fourth most populous country in Africa, following Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Egypt, with a population of 102 million. Globally, it holds the 15th spot among the world’s most populated countries. With projections indicating a significant increase, the DRC is expected to reach a population of 215 million by the year 2050, positioning it among the top 10 most populated countries globally. This growth aligns with the vast size of the country, spanning 2.3 million square kilometers, making it the second-largest country in Africa, after Algeria. DRC is placed 14th on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Bogota, Medellin and Cali consist of the largest population in DRC.\n\n13. Japan\n\nNumber of Cities: 8\n\nWithin Japanese population demographics, the composition consists of Japanese individuals comprising 97.5%, followed by Chinese at 0.6%, Vietnamese at 0.4%, South Koreans at 0.3%, and other groups constituting 1.2%. This category encompasses individuals from various nationalities such as Filipino, Brazilian, Nepalese, Indonesian, American, and Taiwanese, based on estimates from 2022. Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya are top cities in Japan in terms of population sizes.\n\n12. Iran\n\nNumber of Cities: 9\n\nIran's population is predominantly concentrated in the northern, northwestern, and western regions, which aligns with the presence of the Zagros and Elburz Mountains. In contrast, the central and eastern areas of the country, including the areas surrounding the Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut deserts, exhibit significantly lower population densities. Tehran, Mashhad and Esfahan have the largest population in Iran.\n\n11. US\n\nNumber of Cities: 10\n\nUSA is the 11th country on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. The rural (nonmetro) population in the United States is experiencing growth once more following a decade of overall population decline. From July 2020 to June 2022, there was approximately a 0.25% increase in population. This growth was fueled by a higher number of people moving into rural areas than leaving, surpassing the population decrease resulting from natural causes (more deaths than births). The rise in remote work following the COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in this notable shift in migration patterns. New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago are biggest cities in U.S. in terms of population sizes.\n\n10. South Korea\n\nNumber of Cities: 10\n\nSouth Korea's largest cities in terms of population size include Seoul, the capital city, with approximately 9.988 million residents, followed by Busan with 3.472 million, Incheon with 2.849 million, Daegu (Taegu) with 2.181 million, Daejon (Taejon) with 1.577 million, and Gwangju (Kwangju) with 1.529 million residents, as of 2023.\n\n9. Pakistan\n\nNumber of Cities: 10\n\nAs per the United Nations data, individuals under the age of 30 make up 64% of Pakistan's entire population. In 2018, nearly 37.86% of the population were under 14 years old, and approximately 22.5 million individuals, eligible to be registered on the voter's list, participated in the 2024 elections by casting their votes. Pakistan is 9th country on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Pakistan's biggest cities in terms of population sizes include Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad.\n\n8. Turkey\n\nNumber of Cities: 11\n\nA notable reduction in Türkiye's annual population growth in 2023 is seen. While the population previously increased by 7.1 per thousand in 2022, the growth rate has decreased to 1.1 per thousand in 2023, marking the country's lowest level in its history. The previous record for the lowest annual population growth rate was observed in 2020 during the severe pandemic conditions, when the growth rate stood at 5.5 per thousand. Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir are the most popualted cities in Turkey.\n\n7. Russia\n\nNumber of Cities: 15\n\nAlthough Russia is a country with a healthy population – 34.3 million people living in these 15 cities alone – it is currently facing a significant demographic crisis, attributed to prevailing uncertainties in the economic and political environment. The demographic data presents a cause for concern. In August 2023, Russia reported a sharp 29% decline in the natural population during January-June 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, dropping from 383,800 to 272,500. The number of deaths saw a substantial 12.8% decrease from 1,019,000 to 888,700. Notably, the natural population decrease in 2022 exhibited a significant 42.5% decline from 1,042,675 in 2021 to 599,616. Urgent measures are essential to address this pressing demographic challenge in Russia. Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk are the most populated cities in Russia.\n\n6. Nigeria\n\nNumber of Cities: 16\n\nNigeria, placed 6th on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million, consists of a diverse population that demonstrates various ethnic groups, with the Hausa comprising 30%, followed by the Yoruba at 15.5%, and the Igbo (Ibo) at 15.2%. The Fulani ethnic group accounts for 6% of the population, while the Tiv and Kanuri/Beriberi communities each represent 2.4%. Additionally, the Ibibio and Ijaw/Izon groups make up 1.8% each, with the remaining 24.9% classified under other ethnicities based on estimates from 2018. This distribution highlights the rich cultural tapestry present within Nigeria's population. Lagos, Kano and Abuja are the three cities with largest population in the country.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about the 5 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n25 Countries where Muslim Population will Increase the Most by 2030 20 States with the Oldest Population in the US 20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks That Have Created Many Millionaires, and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "A great business can grow and generate value for shareholders for many years. Years of great returns can create millionaire investors. But there are many roads to El Dorado, and different types of stocks can get investors to the same goal of building immense wealth.\n\nSo, here are three magnificent stocks that have made investors rich in the past and can still do it. You might be surprised by some of the names on this list, but don't rush to judge: Multiple investment styles can pay off over time.\n\n1. This growth stock is not done\n\nGrowth investing typically comes to mind when you think of a millionaire-maker. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the poster stocks of this category. Amazon birthed modern e-commerce in America and, as a result, amassed a whopping 38% market share in U.S. e-commerce. A $10,000 investment at its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth over $18 million today.\n\nSo, how will Amazon, now worth nearly $2 trillion, make investors wealthy moving forward? Well, some things will change, but some won't. Today, Amazon is a multi-headed juggernaut with tremendous businesses in e-commerce and cloud computing and is a rising star in streaming and advertising.\n\nThe essential playbook will remain the same. Big-picture growth trends in e-commerce and the cloud are still strong. In America, online sales are still just 15% of total retail. There's a ton of room for expansion. Cloud computing was growing before artificial intelligence (AI) took off in 2023, and that's probably even more likely to grow now over the coming years.\n\nInvestors might see Amazon begin returning capital to shareholders via repurchases more as the company grows and matures. At some point, Amazon could repurchase enough shares to drive years of earnings growth, translating to investment returns, even if the company's ballooning market cap slows down.\n\n2. A big-time wealth compounder\n\nFor most Americans, the home is central to their identity. It's also an expensive investment and often a person's largest lifetime purchase. Home Depot(NYSE: HD) has become an all-time performing stock due to home ownership being a foundation of the American dream. A $10,000 investment at the IPO of America's leading home improvement retailer was recently worth more than $318 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's a simple business model. Home Depot sells tools, appliances, materials, and services to individuals and professional contractors. It's an ongoing business cycle: People move, upgrade their homes, remodel, and build new homes when old homes are destroyed. Home Depot's massive size means it can sell for lower prices than the competition.\n\nHome Depot has dished serious cash to shareholders over the years, which plays a significant role in investment returns. The company has lowered its outstanding shares by 56% since 2000 and has paid dividends for years.\n\nInvestors don't have to make it complicated: Buy and hold Home Depot. While returns will undoubtedly slow as the company grows, Home Depot's proven wealth-building formula makes this blue chip stock as likely to enrich investors over the long term as any.\n\n3. A high-yielding dividend machine\n\nTobacco is seen as a dying industry today, but industry giant Altria Group(NYSE: MO) is one of the greatest-performing investments ever. A $10,000 investment at Altria's IPO recently was worth over $326 million. It's even more impressive when you consider that smoking rates have declined in America for roughly half a century.\n\nAltria, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, is a rare business that can continually raise prices as it sells less of its product. Tobacco is highly regulated in America, so Altria's business faces little competition. The result is a lean and profitable business that generates a ton of cash that flows to investors as dividends and share repurchases.\n\nInvestors get a whopping 9.5% dividend yield today, and Altria has paid and raised its dividend for more than 50 consecutive years. It's a Dividend King. Now, nothing lasts forever, and even Altria will reach a point where it needs to do something else besides sell smokeable products to make money.\n\nAltria is developing alternative  nicotine revenue streams, selling products like electronic vapes, oral nicotine pouches, and heat-not-burn devices. These are still early in their rollout but will play a significant role in the company's future. Investors should monitor the situation to ensure this transition goes smoothly, but feel free to collect that hefty dividend in the meantime.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) has emerged as one of the U.S. stock market's top performers over the past decade. Its share price has soared from 26 cents in February 2014 to $64.50 at the time of writing, generating an impressive return of nearly 21,910% or an annualized compounded return of 72.3% over the last 10 years.\n\nDespite the recent rapid increase in its share price, I maintain an optimistic outlook for Celsius' long-term potential upside. This optimism is based on the company's high growth potential and its ability to improve its operating profitability going forward.\n\nBusiness overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CELH.\n\nCelsius is the manufacturer and distributor of functional energy drinks and protein bars. Its flagship product, CELSIUS, an energy drink that provides energy while burning calories and body fat. The company's products are distributed through various channels, including convenience stores, mass market, fitness and e-commerce. Celsius ranks as the third-largest player in the U.S. energy drink market, holding a 5.90% market share. It follows Red Bull and Monster (NASDAQ:MNST), which hold market shares of 39.50% and 29.70%. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nSource: Statista\n\nCelsius derives its revenue from three main customers. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the largest one, accounting for 22% of the total revenue in 2022. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) ranked second, representing 16.7% of total sales. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stood in third place with 8.80% of the revenue. These leading customers are main distributors of Celsius' products, giving consumers considerable confidence in the brand.\n\nNotably, PepsiCo has become the primary distributor for Celsius products in the U.S since August 2022. It also invested $550 million in Celsius' convertible preferred stock, further strengthening the bond between the two companies. I consider the agreement with PepsiCo as a game changer. As PepsiCo is the globally recognized brand with world-wide distribution channels, the deal with PepsiCo opens the door for Celsius to unlimited growth opportunities in both U.S. and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuperb revenue growth with dismal operating profitability\n\nCelsius has managed to grow its revenue every single year for the past 10 years. Remarkably, its revenue soared 85-fold, climbing from $7.68 million in 2012 to $653.60 million in 2022. This growth translates to an impressive annual compounded growth rate of 56%. Despite this substantial revenue growth, the company recorded operating losses in nine out of the last 10 years. The only profitable year was 2020, where it posted operating profits of $7.83 million. In 2022, its operating income plummeted to a loss of nearly $158 million. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nThe significant operating losses in 2022 can be attributed to a substantial rise in selling and marketing expenses. While revenue more than doubled from $314.30 million in 2021 to $653.60 million in 2022, selling and marketing expenses surged nearly fivefold from $74 million to $353 million in just one year.\n\nA closer examination reveals the selling and marketing expenses for 2022 included $194 million in termination fees paid to previous distributors as part of transitioning to Pepsi to become its primary distributor in the U.S. This expense is one-time, not recurring. After adjusting for these termination expenses, the adjusted selling and marketing costs would be $159 million only.\n\nIt is positive that Celsius has achieved significant operating profits during the first nine months of 2023. During this period, the company reported revenue of $970.60 million and operating profits of $207.40 million, resulting in a substantial operating margin of 21.40%.\n\nDebt-free balance sheet\n\nCelsius has a debt-free balance sheet. As of September, the company holds $760 million in cash and has a shareholders' equity of $213.40 million, with no interest-bearing debt at all. This strong financial position allows Celsius significant flexibility to invest in future growth and expand into international markets. However, maintaining a debt-free balance sheet has come at a cost, specifically in the form of an increasing share count, which leads to the dilution of shareholders' equity. The total number of diluted shares has increased from 60.55 million in 2012 to nearly 227 million in 2022. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nPotential upside\n\nFrom 2018 to mid-2020, the company's enterprise value-to-revenue ratio consistently remained lower than its larger competitor, Monster Beverage. However, since August 2020, its sales multiples has risen rapidly. At the time of writing, Celsius is trading at 12.40 times its sales, while Monster Beverage is trading at 8 times revenue. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nThe higher valuation of Celsius can be justified by its significantly higher revenue growth compared to Monster Beverage. Since 2020, Celsius has experienced annual revenue growth ranging from 50% to 130%, much higher than Monster Beverage's, which experienced sales increase in the range of only 12% to 20%.\n\nAssuming Celsius maintains its historical revenue growth rate of 56% over the next five years, its revenue is projected to reach $12 billion by 2028. If Celsius' operating margin stays at 21%, its operating earnings will be $2.52 billion in 2028. With an earnings multiple of 30, Celsius' enterprise value will be $75.6 billion by 2028. Using a 10% discount rate, the estimated value of Celsius stands at $47 billion. Assuming the company issues 50% more shares over the next five years to fund for its business expansion and acquisitions, the total diluted share count is expected to reach 340 million. Thus, Celsius should be worth $138 per share, 114% higher than its current share price.\n\nConclusion\n\nCelsius Holdings showcases phenomenal business growth, evidenced by its substantial revenue growth and a strong, debt-free balance sheet, emphasizing its financial health. The company's strategic partnership with PepsiCo for the U.S. and international expansion highlights the business' immense potential. Combined with an improving operating margin, Celsius represents a compelling investment opportunity with solid fundamentals and substantial potential upside.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Brilliant Buys in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been some of the top performers in the market in recent years. This group consists of some of the largest companies listed in the U.S. markets. They are:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOf the seven, I think only four are great buys right now. So, where does the split occur?\n\nI'm not a buyer of these three right now\n\nMicrosoft and Apple are at the top of the list of those I'm passing on. Microsoft is excelling as a business, but the stock has gotten a bit pricey. Tipping the scales at 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is one of the most expensive of the group that is optimized for profits.\n\nApple has struggled recently as its revenue shrank for four straight quarters before growing again in its latest quarter, but only by 2%.Apple's woes are expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 1.3% sales growth this fiscal year and 6.5% next year.\n\nThese two are at the bottom of my list, but the next stock is teetering on a buy.\n\nNvidia has been the best performer by far of the group, and there is a lot of hype built up in the stock. But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The stock is actually cheaper than Microsoft (33 times forward earnings), making it a potential buy.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't as tantalizing as the other four.\n\nThese four are much more attractive\n\nThat leaves Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms remaining as buys. All of these have different reasons to buy. For Amazon, its margins have been increasing thanks to the rise of its service divisions. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis has allowed its profits to climb dramatically alongside its rising revenue. Despite this success, it trades at its lowest price-to-sales ratio since 2020. This makes me confident that the best days are still ahead of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has had its fair share of stumbles in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout, which hasn't helped the stock. But it's still a dominant power in advertising and cloud computing, which helped it grow its revenue by 13% in Q4. However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy.\n\nMeta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point.\n\nLastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.\n\nSome of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth. While this is a fair assessment, it also ignores some of the interest rate headwinds buyers are experiencing. Still, management was clear in the conference call that they're between growth waves, so this year may be tough.\n\nBut if you take the long-term view, Tesla's stock is the cheapest it has been in a year, although, at 63 times forward earnings, it's still pricey. If you've missed the Tesla boat, now might be a good time to hop in.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks won't have the same performance they had in 2023 going forward, some are still strong buys and have market-beating potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Dell Just Gave Nvidia and AMD Investors Something to Cheer -- and Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Investors Something to Perhaps Fear",
        "content": "You don't have to read tea leaves to try to learn about companies' prospects. However, it's not a bad idea to read the transcripts from other companies that operate in the same industry. Sometimes, executives from a competitor, customer, or vendor share things in quarterly updates that provide insight you can't get anywhere else.\n\nDell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) just might have done just that last week. On Feb. 29, the technology company held its quarterly conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter results. During that call, Dell gave Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Computers(NASDAQ: AMD) investors something to cheer. And it perhaps gave Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors something to fear.\n\nSomething to cheer\n\nLike many companies, Dell is enjoying strong tailwinds from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). COO Jeff Clark said in the Q4 conference call that his company saw robust demand for its AI-optimized servers. Clark added that Dell's flagship PowerEdge XE9680 is \"the fastest-ramping solution in company history.\" Overall, orders in Q4 for the company's AI-optimized servers soared by nearly 40% from the previous quarter.\n\nWhy is this something for Nvidia and AMD investors to cheer? Dell's AI-optimized servers use graphics processing units (GPUs) from both Nvidia and AMD. Clark said that the high demand \"was spread across the H100, H800, the H200, and the MI300X.\" The first three of those GPUs are made by Nvidia, while the last one is made by AMD.\n\nClark noted that \"demand continues to outpace GPU supply.\" He stated that there's \"strong interest\" from customers in servers with next-generation AI GPUs such as Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI300X. Importantly, Clark observed that \"most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of the comments from Dell's COO should bring smiles to Nvidia and AMD investors. The picture painted by Clark is one of tremendous current demand for the two chipmaker's GPUs that doesn't appear to be waning.\n\nFew will find any of what Clark said surprising, of course. However, it's good to hear confirmation from an industry leader who isn't associated with Nvidia or AMD. And his comments seem to help justify the massive gains both stocks have delivered so far this year.\n\nSomething to fear?\n\nBut Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet investors might not like some of Clark's other statements. He seemed to take a deliberate dig at predictions that the cloud is where the future of AI lies.\n\nClark said, \"We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem [on-premises], where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure.\" He pointed out that around 83% of all data is currently stored on-premises.\n\nAccording to Clark's view, more data will be generated at the edge of networks outside of data centers going forward than inside data centers. Because of this, he argued that \"AI will ultimately get deployed next to where the data is created, driven by latency.\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q3 call in October 2023: \"[C]ustomers want to bring the [AI] models to their data, not the other way around.\" That might sound as if he and Clark are on the same page. However, Jassy also stated in Amazon's 2023 Q1 call that he believes that the heavy concentration of IT spending that's currently on-premises will move to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) benefiting from this transition.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed in January 2023, \"The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it.\" He made this statement in the context of discussing Microsoft's cloud platform, boasting that his company had \"the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud.\"\n\nWhat does Alphabet think? CEO Sundar Pichai said in his company's latest quarterly update that AI is \"driving interest and early adoption\" of Google Cloud. This AI boom has been the primary tailwind driving Alphabet stock higher over the last 12 months.\n\nBut if Clark is right that the future of AI is on-premises and not in the cloud, the growth prospects for Amazon, Microsoft, and Google perhaps won't be as strong as their CEOs and investors anticipate. In Dell's vision of what's on the way, local devices could be more important than cloud platforms.\n\nCheers all around\n\nShould Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet investors be worried? I don't think so. The underlying reasons why organizations continue to move their apps and data to the cloud won't go away. Cloud platforms help lower total costs and provide more flexibility and scalability than on-premises data centers.\n\nThat said, I do think that Clark is probably right that the use of AI on local devices will increase. He's also absolutely correct that customers are only in the early innings of AI deployment.\n\nThere's good news for all of these companies, in my view. Nvidia and AMD should win as the demand for GPUs soars. Dell should win as the demand for AI-optimized servers grows. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet should win as more customers build AI apps on the cloud.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Could Trigger a Natural Gas Boom in Europe",
        "content": "When the use of seismic surveys became common place, Oil and gas drillers used to drill only in spots the human eye could detect from seismic and other data, but that’s all changing now. The next round of onshore discoveries is being aided by new Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning software that sees what we can’t, forever disrupting the exploration game.\n\nNowhere is this more urgent than in Europe—a continent starved for domestic resources since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the weaponization of Russian natural gas.\n\nMachine Learning software capable of sampling large volumes of 3D seismic, breaking down wave forms to identify unique patterns, and revealing new targets for the drill bit that the human eye has never seen …\n\nThat completely changes exploration.\n\nIt’s been used around the world, and now, it’s being deployed in Austria and Germany by junior explorer MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), the North American company that is the first to offer investors exposure to European natural gas since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nMCF saw the value of this technology early on and has used it extensively wherever possible in their search for gas in Europe, according to its CEO, James Hill.\n\nAnd for Germany, in particular, the timing is critical. Critical enough, in fact, that the EU has reclassified natural gas as “Green” and sustainable.\n\nIf Germany fails to sustainably make up for its winding down of Russian natural gas domestically, high-priced LNG imports, delayed nuclear power phaseout and even restarting of dormant coal plants will be the outcome. Renewables cannot yet bridge the gap in the energy transition, and resorting to coal would set things back drastically for the climate.\n\nNatural Gas Paradise Beyond the Human Eye\n\nIn the past, humans only picked prospects to drill visually from the 3D seismic aided by visual hydrocarbon indicators in the data. Now, thanks to new software, they can drill in places they never would have before. AI and Machine Learning sees what we can’t.\n\nStory continues\n\nMCF Energy has both—the power of AI to see beyond the human eye, and prospects with a previously drilled  well that produced gas in Austria, along with two previous discoveries in Germany. MCF has just started drilling at its Welchau prospect in Austria. Welchau is a geologic structure you can see from space and covers about 100 sq km.  An independent evaluation estimated potentially recoverable resources of some 100 million barrels of oil equivalent in an evaluation last year.  A well drilled in the 80’s found producible gas and condensate just south of the location being drilled, confirming the presence of gas in the area.\n\nWhen this 40-day drill is complete, MCF is planning to move the drill rig to Germany, where it will re-open an oil and gas play of over 110 square kilometers in the Lech and East Lech concessions, which have already seen two historical discoveries and three previously drilled wells at Lech.\n\nThey’re not drilling blind, or with limitations of the human eye.\n\n\"The Machine Learning technology that MCF Energy is using allows for the computer to ‘see’ information within seismic data which the human eye cannot. This technology is a game changer and is only now being discovered by other operators,” MCF Energy’s Hill told Oilprice.com recently. Using Paradise software, MCF Energy’s key AI analyst, advisor Deborah Sacrey, has a prediction success rate of over 80% for drilling in areas that are not visual to humans on the data. She has 9 discoveries of this nature to her name, according to the company.\n\nSacrey, a geologist and geophysicist with 45 years of oil and gas exploration experience in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of the U.S., specializes in 2D and 3D seismic interpretation. She’s the only one using Paradise for her clientele, and that’s because she was one of its developers.\n\nParadise software isn’t proprietary, but only a small field of experts have the ability to effectively use it, and MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF) has the advantage of having one of its developers on its advisory board.\n\nThe power of supercomputing has now reached the point of being able to sample data within a 3D seismic volume and break down the wave forms into over 50 “neurons” that each have different attributes of waves. Those “neurons” are then matched up to well information in both dry and producing wells. And comparing this treasure trove of data then yields a unique set of “neurons” that identify gas, oil, porosity and many other factors that control production.\n\nSource: Geoinsights.com\n\nAI scans the entire data set for those unique sets of “neurons” and identifies them on the map.\n\nParadise software, according to Sacrey, analyzes seismic data 15 times more densely than other existing software, and that allows it to distinguish very thin beds of deposition in the subsurface and see thin streaks of porosity that the human eye cannot.\n\nParadise’s Fault Detection uses deep learning and machine learning to automatically detect faults, and generates attributes to extract meaningful geological information.\n\nState-of-the-art color-blending highlights geologic features, such as faults or stratigraphic features, in 3D.\n\nParadise software applies Self-Organizing Map (SOM) unsupervised machine learning to reveal stratigraphic facies and their distributions, and captures facies based on distinctive seismic patterns using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning technology.\n\nEstimating volumes of reserves, resources and geologic features, and comparing machine learning classification results and other seismic attributes to traditional well logs should help explorers like MCF get the drill bit in the right place faster, cheaper and much more efficiently.\n\nThis potentially gives MCF Energy a “leg up” when it comes to analyzing the areas to drill and helps to reduce risk in understanding the subsurface.\n\nHow AI Is Changing Exploration & Discovery\n\nThe oil and gas industry is AI’s and Machine Learning’s biggest cheerleader.\n\nThat’s because the disruption these technologies creates and opens opportunities, which could turn into major upside. Forbes calls the changes “profound”, noting that the world’s top 20 oil and gas producers all have major AI strategies for every point along the chain.\n\nMordor Intelligence projected oil and gas spending on AI to close out 2023 at $2.38 billion, and to reach $4.21 billion by the end of 2028.\n\nNew AI announcements come on a near-daily basis.\n\nShell—the biggest producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico--will use AI-based technology from big-data analytics company SparkCognition for deep sea exploration and production—both to pinpoint where to drill and boost offshore production.\n\nAI could shorten exploration to less than nine days from nine months, the two companies said in a statement, with SparkCognition’s Bruce Porter noting that “generative AI for seismic imaging can positively disrupt the exploration process and has broad and far-reaching implications\".\n\nBack in Europe, MCF is doing the same—onshore, and on a continent that desperately needs to secure energy independence from Russia, without creating a secondary dependence on expensive American LNG.\n\nNow, as MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), prepares for its first drill in Germany, it’s armed with a significant AI and Machine Learning advantage for targeting drills in plays abandoned by supermajors decades ago, before Europe realized it couldn’t survive on cheap Russian gas anymore.\n\nMCF’s Lech prospect in Germany came with a modern 3D seismic survey of over 160 square kilometers of 3D seismic data to apply new Paradise Machine Learning technology to. “Using this,” said Hill, “we were able to identify the gas-bearing zones precisely and compare them to the rest of the area. We compared the known gas-bearing area in Lech with the rest of the survey covering Lech East and identified multiple prospects with great potential.”\n\nParadise’s AI – Machine Learning Workbench distinguishes thin beds and Direct Hydrocarbon indicators while identifying and calibrating detailed stratigraphy and automatically detecting faults and revealing fracture trends. It also classifies seismic facies, isolates geobodies and calculates potential oil and gas volumes .\n\nMachine learning allows for the concise ability to reveal the natural gas targets and handle well placement to key zones with porosity and hydrocarbon potential identical to the proven areas, and MCF was one of the first companies to apply it to the entire exploration and development program, according to Hill.\n\n“This proven technique greatly reduces the risk in drilling and helps target the best possible places and depths to drill these wells,” Hill said, adding that it has had a prediction success rate of over 80% when it comes to predicting the geology to identify previously unseen discoveries.\n\nBig Tech is Turning the Oil and Gas Sector on Its Head\n\nGoogle Cloud, a product of Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "For the most part, Reddit’s picks from 2021 haven’t panned out well at all over the long term. You probably aren’t going to find any standout stocks in the same place where you are finding fail videos and extremist political ramblings. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), for example, closed at $4.36 on March 1, versus its 2021 high of nearly $500, while GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), finished at $14.95 on March 1, down from its 2021 high of $120.75. Another Reddit favorite from a few years ago, Bed, Bath and Beyond, even went bankrupt, while headphone maker Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) tumbled from its 2021 high of $127 to $2.50.\n\nEven Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) which has been relatively successful amid the resilience of crypto prices, is still trading well below its 2021 high of $369. Those stocks’ track records show that, over the longer term, powerful fundamentals and huge opportunities win out over bursts of popularity that are completely unjustified by fundamentals and reality-based outlooks. With that in mind, here are three stocks to buy that will indeed climb over the long term because their issuing firms have excellent businesses and great, easily converted opportunities.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is benefiting a great deal from its focus on helping its customers implement AI and shift to a mix of public and private clouds. As a result, it’s one of the best stocks to buy currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the firm’s Watsonx AI platform is proving to be quite popular, with more than 150 enterprioses, including Citi (NYSE:C), NASA, and Samsung, using the system as of last July.\n\nFurthermore, IBM has since made the platform more appealing by partnering with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, AWS, to allow its customers “to quickly and responsibly scale AI workloads by using a comprehensive stack of generative AI, which consists of Amazon Bedrock and IBM watsonx running on AWS Cloud and across hybrid cloud environments. ”\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more organizations greatly increase their use of AI, the growth of the firm’s Data & AI revenue will accelerate, Seeking Alpha columnist Uttam Dey recently predicted.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had more than its share of skeptics in recent weeks, as bears have questioned whether the firm’s search engine can withstand challenges from AI chatbots and the answers provided by its own AI to certain questions offended some users.\n\nHowever, old habits are hard to break, so I predict that most users will continue to rely on Google’s search engine for many years to come. Furthermore, according to a majority of sources, Alphabet’s underlying AI technology is actually very strong.\n\nWhat’s more, the tech giant, which had nearly $111 billion of cash as of the end of last quarter, can afford to make acquisitions and hire many experts to greatly improve the quality of its AI offerings over the longer term.\n\nAlso, I’m confident that by 2030, Waymo will contribute considerable amounts to the firm’s top and bottom lines.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputer network equipment maker Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 12, showing that it’s benefiting meaningfully from the AI boom.\n\nThe firm’s top line climbed by an impressive 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income rose to $513.6 million, up from $427.1 million in Q4 of 2022.\n\nAmong the company’s most prolific customers are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), which are also two of the largest beneficiaries of the AI Revolution. As MSFT and Meta continue to get big boosts from their deployment of AI, Arista’s financial results should continue to surge.\n\nAmong the 21 Wall Street analysts who cover the name, 13 rate it a “Strong Buy” and two have “Buy” ratings on it.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to advance to $7.59 this year and $8.56 next year from the $6.94 of EPS that it generated in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in COIN.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the oldest U.S. market index, created on May 26, 1896. Throughout history, its components have been large, established American businesses with competitive advantages. That tradition continues today with top Dow stocks to buy featuring some of the best global companies.\n\nAs stock markets hit all-time highs, it’s time to consider some top Dow stocks to buy. Because the market has rallied over 20% since November 2023, it might be due for a pullback. According to the Carson Group, since 1980, the market has experienced an average drawdown of 14.3% in any given year.\n\nWhile a 14% correction is manageable, the more volatile growth stocks could decline materially. In contrast, the top Dow stocks to buy are stable large-cap stocks. Typically, they have a lower beta, hence, lower drawdowns during corrections. Moreover, in recent years, investors have treated these companies as defensive due to their robust balance sheets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the market due for a correction, playing some defense with the following top Dow stocks to buy is warranted. Besides their defensive qualities, they are also long-term compounders.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the latest inclusion in the Dow. The company joined the index on February 26, replacing pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA). There are several reasons why it’s one of the top Dow stocks to buy.\n\nFirst, in its North American retail segment, the company is finally earning a return on its investments. Due to a massive fulfillment network expansion during 2020 and 2021, returns diminished. Results are improving now that capital expenditures are declining and the firm has shifted to a regional fulfillment network. Segment operating margins rose from -0.9% in Q4 2022 to 4.2% in Q4 2023.\n\nSecondly, the company’s most profitable segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is reaccelerating. In 2022 and 2023, revenue growth decelerated due to customer cost optimization and macro fears stalling new deals. These trends are reversing, with the segment growing 13% in Q4 2023 compared to 12% in Q3 2023. Furthermore, the emergence of generative AI has only increased the demand for Amazon’s cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThirdly, Amazon is rapidly growing its advertising business into a massive behemoth. Today, Amazon is the third largest advertising business globally. In 2023, advertising services revenue was $46.7 billion and grew 26% year over year (YOY) in Q4 2023.\n\nAltogether, Amazon has an enviable position. It is the leader in online retail in North America, and AWS has the largest share of cloud computing globally. Additionally, the rapidly growing advertising business will boost overall profitability due to its higher margins. Considering these strengths, this technology and e-commerce giant is among the top Dow stocks to buy.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a credit card provider that caters to higher-income consumers. It has always maintained a higher growth rate due to the propensity of this cohort to spend. Furthermore, due to the credit quality of this target market, delinquencies remain low even during poor economic environments.\n\nThe credit card company is a stable business that earns a high return on equity. That’s why even Warren Buffet appreciates its durability and economic moat. The company is one of the longest-held and the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) equity portfolio.\n\nIn the current economic environment, the credit card provider continues to thrive. The economy is growing and unemployment is low, supporting discretionary spending. Furthermore, consumers are still prioritizing services over goods. International travel has been robust, which has boosted spending on American Express credit cards.\n\nThe company just delivered an outstanding 2023 with total revenues net of interest expenses increasing 14%. Additionally, diluted EPS grew 14%. For 2024, management expects revenue growth between 9% and 11% and EPS in the range of $12.65 to $13.15.\n\nAs of this writing, AXP stock remains one of the top Dow stocks to buy. At 17 times forward EPS, it is a bargain. Furthermore, the stock has a seal of approval from Warren Buffet, the world’s greatest investor.\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough this pharmaceutical giant is up over 16% year to date (YTD), it is still a buy. First, it is a bargain at a forward price-to-earnings of 15. Secondly, its oncology and vaccines portfolio is well-positioned for growth.\n\nThe main growth driver for Merck is its blockbuster drug Keytruda. It is already one of the best-selling drugs and continues to be approved for multiple indications. In 2023, Keytruda sales rose by 21%, hitting $25 billion.\n\nThe blockbuster continues to enjoy robust global demand from metastatic indications. Furthermore, rising global uptake for new indications is driving growth. The drug is seeing increased usage in indications such as renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nKeytruda continues to receive approvals for new indications. In February 2024, Canada approved the drug for gastric cancer, and in Europe, it was authorized for resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Since its launch in 2014, it has received over 40 approvals to treat various cancers.\n\nThe rest of the portfolio also has several blockbusters. For instance, Gardasil was a top earner in 2023, achieving $8.9 billion in sales in 2023. And, the company is investing heavily in its pipeline. In 2023, it spent $30 billion in research and development to discover the next generation of drugs.\n\nMerck has an expansive portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines experiencing growing demand worldwide. This, coupled with financial and operational strength, lands it among the top Dow stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2024 Refresh: 3 Stocks With New Potential After Layoffs News",
        "content": "Layoffs are, without a doubt, no fun. Massive rounds of layoffs in companies create significant stress and anxiety, and can be expensive to implement with severance costs and payouts that accompany such moves. However, layoffs can be positive in the long run as they help companies become leaner, more nimble, and adjust to the economic realities of the day. Many companies across corporate America ended 2023 and began 2024 by announcing big headcount reductions. Most of these companies found the layoffs were necessary due to overstaffing during the pandemic. Emerging from the Covid-19 crisis, they found themselves with too many employees on their payrolls. As inflation and the interest rates used to tame it have risen, companies have felt the need to optimize their workforces and ensure they are positioned for the coming year. Here is the 2024 refresh: three stocks with new potential after layoffs news.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) the amazon logo displayed on a sign outdoors\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced at the start of January that it was cutting hundreds of entertainment jobs at its film and television studios, as well as its videogame-streaming platform. Notably, Twitch, the video game platform owned by Amazon, announced a cut of just over 500 jobs. In an email to staff, Amazon added that: “We will be eliminating several hundred roles across the Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios organization.”\n\nThe round of layoffs announced at the start of this year come after Amazon cut 27,000 jobs in 2023 as it moved to get costs under control following the Covid-19 pandemic. The new round of cuts also comes as Amazon modifies its Prime streaming service, raising prices and adding advertisements to the platform. Weeks after announcing the new round of job cuts, Amazon achieved its best quarterly financial results in more than two years. As of now, AMZN stock is up nearly 20%, bringing its 12-month gain to 88%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, right before Christmas, music streaming service Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) shocked markets by announcing a massive layoff encompassing 17% of its global workforce. The Swedish-based company said it is reducing workforce to decrease costs and adjust to slowing subscriber growth. In an email to staff, CEO Daniel Ek said that Spotify was taking “substantial action to right size our costs,” adding that the company took on too many employees in recent years.\n\nThe headcount reduction worked out to roughly 1,500 jobs. The layoffs come after Spotify reported a $70.7 million profit in the third quarter of last year, which was due almost entirely to lower spending. Spotify also raised prices for its monthly subscriptions and has expanded into podcasts and audio books. The company previously cut 8% of its workforce earlier in 2023. While no doubt difficult, the job cuts enabled Spotify to issue strong forward guidance in February. SPOT stock is up 40% so far in 2024.\n\nNike (NKE)\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but not least, we have Nike (NYSE:NKE). In mid-February, the sneaker and athletic wear giant announced plans to cut 2% of its global workforce, more than 1,600 jobs, to lower expenses amid what it referred to as weak demand. Last December, Nike announced a $2 billion cost savings plan over the next three years as it reported disappointing earnings. The cost cuts call for reducing management positions and about $450 million in employee severance costs.\n\nThe cost cuts and headcount reduction come after Nike warned that retailers are lowering their orders for its sneakers and athletic apparel through wholesale channels, and that it continues to be impacted by an economic slowdown in China, its second largest market worldwide. Nike has also lost ground to upstart brands such as Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) Hoka running shoes. Nike had 83,700 employees globally last summer. NKE stock is down 16% over the last 12 months, including a 4% decline this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in DECK.

        "title": "Apple gets squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic",
        "content": "Apple is getting squeezed by antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nJust as the tech giant braces for a sweeping lawsuit from the Justice Department in the US, it was hit Monday with a $2 billion European Commission (EC) fine for allegedly breaking competition laws overseas.\n\nApple intends to fight the decision from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust regulator. It also has been trying to convince Justice Department officials not to file their suit, according to media reports.\n\nThe company and its lawyers even met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in late February to make its last-ditch argument, according to those reports. Jonathan Kanter, Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nApple (AAPL) has long avoided the government-induced antitrust headaches now plaguing Big Tech rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). But that is now changing.\n\nThe stock of Apple was down nearly 3% during morning trading, following the decision by the European Commission.\n\nThe EC’s action was very specific: It fined the company for wielding its dominance to the detriment of its rivals in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nThose practices first came under investigation in the European Union in 2019 after Swedish music streaming giant Spotify (SPOT) filed a formal complaint about the store's rules. EU Commission vice president Margrethe Vestager addresses the media Monday at EU headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe EC concluded that Apple drove up music streaming costs for iOS users for nearly a decade by prohibiting app developers from fully informing them about alternative ways to access and pay for streaming services outside of Apple’s proprietary app store.\n\nThrough provisions in Apple’s contracts, the EC said Apple illegally steered app purchases predominantly through the App Store, where Apple collects a 30% fee.\n\n\"Apple's conduct, which lasted for almost ten years, may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store,\" the commission said in a summary of its findings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response, Apple criticized the EC, saying that its decision failed to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignored that the music streaming market is thriving, competitive, and fast-growing.\n\n\"The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify,\" Apple said in a blog post. It went on to point out that Spotify had grown to become the largest music streaming app in the world while paying Apple nothing for its services. An Apple store in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s,\" Apple said, attributing a major part of that success to the App Store.\n\nApple has previously characterized Spotify's complaint with the EC as an attempt to get \"limitless access\" to Apple's tools, free of charge.\n\nThe US antitrust investigation appears to be even more sweeping, according to media reports. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the company’s suite of products — including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags — blocks competition.\n\nAny DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apple’s \"walled garden\" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative.\n\nThe company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best consumer electronics stocks. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the consumer electronics industry, head over to 5 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nConsumer electronics are widely used in households, with televisions featuring larger screens gaining popularity, while electrical components are becoming more compact. Companies are focusing on creating high-performance, user-friendly devices to meet the growing demand. This trend, along with technological advancements and digitalization, is expected to drive the demand for electronic items and household appliances. The global consumer electronics market was valued at $738.75 billion in 2022, $773.40 billion in 2023, and is projected to grow to $1,239.40 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.97% during the forecast period from 2024-2030, as perFortune Business Insights. The increasing popularity of smart homes is driving the adoption of smart appliances worldwide. These appliances come with features like voice assistance, bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, offering greater convenience. As people's income levels rise, they are investing more in housing and equipping their homes with advanced technological products. The introduction of innovative household products is expected to further boost consumption. Governments worldwide are also supporting the growth of the electronics industry. For example, India aims to reach a $300 billion electronics manufacturing and export market by 2025-26, encouraging the development of technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and machine learning.\n\nAnalysts expect the US consumer electronics industry to rebound in 2024 after two years of decline, as reported by Investor’s Business Daily. The Consumer Technology Association forecasts a 2.8% increase in retail sales, reaching $512 billion this year, compared to a 3.1% decrease to $498 billion in 2023. This turnaround is attributed to a refresh cycle for personal computers, smartphones, and other devices purchased during the COVID crisis. The surge in remote work, distance learning, and stay-at-home orders during the pandemic led to increased purchases of consumer electronics and digital services. Moreover, the introduction of artificial intelligence features is expected to drive upgrades of PCs, smartphones, and other devices in 2024, according to Richard Kowalski, senior director of business intelligence for the CTA. He commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“AI is already incorporated in many devices and services. Think about the natural language processing in our digital assistants, computer vision in our vehicle safety systems and health tracking algorithms in our smartwatches.”\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 contributed to consumer awareness and interest in generative AI, as per Brian Comiskey, CTA's director of thematic programs. Comiskey anticipates augmented reality and virtual reality headsets to be growth drivers in consumer electronics this year. The Consumer Technology Association predicts that consumer software and services revenue will outpace hardware sales, growing by 3.8% to $163 billion. This segment is led by entertainment software and services, including audio, video, and gaming. On the other hand, consumer electronics hardware sales are expected to increase by 2.3% to $349 billion, reversing a 5.4% decline in 2023.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show 2024 was a showcase of cutting-edge technology and a glimpse into the future of tech. According to Forbes, Artificial intelligence and machine learning took the spotlight, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) introducing new GenAI-powered Alexa experiences.

They have an explicit strategy to sacrifice gross margins from their TVs to further develop the audience for their smart TV offering, a competitor to Roku. I purchased the shares expecting the thesis to play out over a number of years, so I intend to monitor the company and its results as we move forward. Their first quarter results reflected strength in their Platform (Smart TV) segment, which will be their primary source of profit going forward. Further, the news that Netflix and other streaming companies are considering subscriptions that include advertising is positive news. In some ways, what is old is new again, as this development is somewhat of a return to the dual-revenue-stream model cable TV channels use. The shift towards more streaming programming including advertisements is a positive for Vizio, since they may be able to monetize the ads directly or indirectly. I’ll keep you posted on their progress.”\n\n6. GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\n\nGoPro, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY), and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR), GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) is one of the best consumer electronics stocks to buy. It ranks 6th on our list.\n\nHere is what Roubaix Capital has to say about GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) in their Q4 2020 investor letter:\n\n“Companies like GoPro (GPRO) should benefit from the consumer rebound, but also have their own unique drivers of value over the next 2+ years. In the case of GPRO, the company launched its newest action camera, the GoPro9, under the umbrella of a new business model. The company offers a discount on the camera when customers purchase a subscription agreement that comes with additional services and benefits. The uptake of the subscription has been strong to date and offers the company a line of sight to a higher margin and more predictable revenue stream. The stock’s low double digit earnings multiple remains undemanding. We have seen this type of transformation play out in numerous situations in software, hardware and even retail companies such as RH. We see GPRO following suit and expect a return to travel later this year to be another reason for consumers to buy a new camera as they head back out on vacation.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States That Don’t Tax Retirement Pension Payouts 12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour 25 Countries with Most Gold Reserves in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "The Art of Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Taxes in a World of AI",
        "content": "The AI Wave\n\nThe weather may be cold during winter, but stocks were scorching hot last month, fueled in part by the surge in performance from AI (Artificial Intelligence) stocks. More specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up +2.2% to 38,996. The S&P 500 surged +5.2% to 5,096. And the AI-heavy Nasdaq index climbed the most by +6.1% to 16,092.\n\nLeading the bull market brigade higher was NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which saw its stock launch higher by +29% for the month after reporting eye-popping quarterly revenues of $22 billion, more than tripling versus last year's comparable quarter. Customers of NVIDIA, like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are also benefiting from the rising tide of investor sentiment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nTo put this AI wave into perspective, you need look no further than to the comments made by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stated by the end of 2024, the company should have 350,000 of NVIDIA's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) as part of the company's AI infrastructure. At roughly $25,000 to $30,000 per GPU, the total cost is likely approaching $10 billion for just this one NVIDIA customer. Also, Dell Technologies' (NYSE:DELL) stock price opened more than +30% higher today after reporting quarterly financial results that exceeded forecasts due to robust demand for AI servers, which led to their backlog almost doubling in three months to $2.9 billion.\n\nWhen you have corporate America in addition to the large cloud data center providers (think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud) all battling to secure NVIDIA chips for their generative AI, machine learning initiatives, you can understand why NVIDIA's stock is up +250% in one year to a company value of $2 trillion. The Art of Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Taxes in a World of AI\n\nJapan's Nikkei & Dow Both Break 39,000 Record Concurrently\n\nNot only did the Dow hit an all-time record high of 39,000 last month, but a stunning coincidence also occurred in Japan. The Nikkei 225, which is like the Japanese equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also hit a record high of 39,000 last month. What's the big difference between these two indexes simultaneously surpassing a record 39,000 in the same month?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt took the Nikkei over 34 years to surpass its previous record peak, which was last achieved in 1989 when Japan experienced a massive bursting of an asset bubble. On the other hand, it merely took the Dow just one month to break its previous recordnot four decades. Worth noting, so far in 2024, the Nikkei has been the world's best-performing major index surging 19%, almost triple the gain of the S&P 500 index.\n\nTax Time\n\nApril is fast approaching, which means it's that time of the year when Uncle Sam will come knocking on your door with your tax bill. Perhaps your taxes have already been prepaid and a refund is coming your way. Regardless, the goal of long-term investing is to master the art of maximizing returns and limiting taxes subject to your risk tolerance.\n\nHow does one create an investment masterpiece? One way to maximize return is to lower costs, including lower management fees, fund fees, and transaction costs. You can think of these investment costs as a leaky faucet. In the short-run, most people do not care about or are unaware of a leak.\n\nThe same principle applies to investment fees/costs. Investors can ignore these fees in the short-term, but over months or years, these costs can become enormous and destructive. I experienced this firsthand. Recently, normal monthly water bill was $40, but one leaky toilet resulted in an $800 monthly billouch! Just imagine what unknown leaky costs on your investments could mean for your retirement. Do you want high or unknown investment fees to delay your retirement by years? I think not. Focus on lower costs because quite simply, the less you pay, the more you keep, and the earlier you can retire.\n\nAnother way to maximize your investment performance is to benefit from the power of compounding. This phenomenon can only be achieved via the snowball-effect of long-term investing. This is why Albert Einstein called compounding the 8th Wonder of the World. At Sidoxia Capital Management, we have experienced this marvel on many of our investments, including our exponential gains in Amazon.com, which we first purchased in 2008 at s split-adjusted price of about $2.95 per share. The stock price recently closed at $177, a 60-fold increase from our initial purchase.\n\nThe risk-adjusted aspect of your nest-egg is also important because most people should consider decreasing risk as you more closely approach retirement age, especially if you are planning to tap your investments for liquidity. If risk wasn't a consideration, going to the Las Vegas roulette table and betting your life savings on black might be a good idea. Sure, you might have a chance of doubling your money instantly, but you could also lose it all in a blink of an eye.\n\nAnother way of thinking about risk, since we are in the heart of ski season, is to contemplate a ski instructor's advice for an 80-year-old beginner vs. an experienced Olympic downhill gold medalist. It wouldn't make sense for the 80-year-old beginner to train on the steep, advanced black diamond runs. Similarly, it wouldn't make sense for the gold-medalist Olympian to train on the flat beginner runs. The same concept holds true for investing. Young investors generally can take on more risk, while retirees often should be more conservative in their asset allocation, especially if they need liquidity from their investments to fund their living expenses and lifestyle.\n\nAlthough it would be nice to have ChatGPT create a luxurious retirement for you with a click of a button, unfortunately life is not that simple. You certainly can, and should, take advantage of the AI revolution in your investment portfolio to support your retirement goals, but successful investing requires more than that. With over 30 years of investment experience under my belt, at Sidoxia, we understand there are multiple facets to successful investing. In a diversified portfolio that that takes account of your risk tolerance, we strongly believe low-cost, tax-efficient, long-term investing is the best way to create your retirement masterpiece.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks, including NVDA, META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, and certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), but at the time of publishing had no direct position in DELL or any other security referenced in this article.

        "title": "eBay Delivered A Pleasant Fourth Quarter Surprise Despite Ongoing Weaknesses",
        "content": "On Tuesday, eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) topped market expectations with its fourth quarter performance.  Last month, the online marketplace slashed about 1,000 jobs which adds up to about 9% of its workforce as the industry braces for an uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Even its rival e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) wasn’t immune to the layoffs wave. At the beginning of February, Amazon confirmed more layoffs across its Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical segments after initiating job cuts in January across its entire business, including its Buy With Prime and streaming units.\n\nFourth Quarter And 2023 highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, 2023, eBay reported that revenue grew 2% to $2.56 billion, beating LSEG’s average estimate of $2.51 billion, as business improved toward the end of November, particularly in the U.S. This fourth quarter revenue is eBay’s highest since 2021’s comparable quarter, when it reached $2.61 billion, but its highest quarterly revenue since the beginning of the COVID-19 era is $3.02 billion it generated during 2021’ first quarter.\n\nAdjusted profit per share amounted to $1.07, topping the estimate of $1.03 per share.\n\nNet income rose 8% YoY to $728 million while diluted earnings per share grew by 13% YoY to $1.40. The total volume of goods and services sold, gross merchandise volume rose 2%, to $18.59 billion. Although GMV grew during the quarter on a YoY basis, with organic GMV growth improving YoY during each quarter of 2023, it still decreased slightly for the full year, more specifically 1%. After reaching $100 billion, annual GMV has been declining for three consecutive years now.\n\nFor the full year 2023, eBay reported a revenue increase of 3% to $10.11 billion. Active buyers count has remained the same for the last three quarters at 132 million. But despite adding buyer-friendly features, its lost active buyers on a YoY basis to Amazon and rivals.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst Quarter Guidance\n\neBay guided for revenue in the range between $2.50 billion and $2.54 billion, in line with the analyst consensus estimate of $2.54 billion. As for adjusted earnings, eBay’s guidance is between $1.19 per share and $1.23 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.13 per share.\n\nA challenging macroeconomic backdrop remains.\n\neBay continues to face intense competition from larger hybrid marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart (NYSE: WMT). CEO Jamie Iannone reported the company observed weakness in UK and German markets, with the latter even experiencing negative e-commerce growth. But despite flat GMV, eBay recorded a revenue increase that reflects the company’s focus on more profitable sectors and on increasing the span of functions and features for sellers.\n\neBay is also pursuing a generative AI tool expansion.\n\nDuring the earnings call on February 27th, eBay revealed that millions of its sellers have already used the AI-powered Magical Listing process that was launched last year to write product descriptions.\n\neBay is also developing a generative AI tool that uses image-recognition technology to prefill or suggest product titles, categories and similar aspects of an item based on its photo. It is also leveraging AI technology to increase the appeal of sellers’ product images with AI-generated backgrounds.\n\nBeing in business for almost three decades, eBay proved the durability of its financial model as it continues to navigate a challenging environment. CFO Steve Priest proudly spoke of the company’s 2023 execution and he expressed confidence in the long-term outlook as eBay continues to bend over backwards to keep its shoppers.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Retail, known for its consistent growth, is one of the best markets for long-term investment. The industry ranges from grocery to e-commerce, consumer tech, and much more, allowing stockholders to benefit from the tailwinds of dozens of segments. The global retail market hit a valuation of $27 trillion in 2022 and is projected to rise to $30 trillion this year.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has enjoyed immense success in the industry, with leading market shares in multiple areas of consumer tech, from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. In fact, Apple has the third-largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite having a significantly smaller product range than its rivals.\n\nHowever, it's hard to consider Apple's stock when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) also exists. The company is the world's second-biggest retailer (only after Walmart) and is the No. 1 name in e-commerce. Additionally, Amazon's diverse business model has seen it gain a powerful position in tech, with a leading 31% market share in the $626 billion cloud market. AMZN Chart\n\nThis chart shows Amazon's stock significantly outperforming Apple's over the last year. Meanwhile, various growth catalysts in retail and tech will likely keep the company on its current trajectory.\n\nSo forget Apple and buy this unstoppable growth stock instead.\n\nAmazon has delivered an impressive turnaround\n\nAn economic downturn caused a marketwide sell-off that saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33% in 2022. Retail companies were hit particularly hard as inflation spikes forced consumers to cut discretionary spending. As a result, shares in Amazon fell 50% in 2022 alongside steep profit declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company has made an impressive recovery since then, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion.\n\nA range of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation bolstered the company's e-commerce business and its free cash flow skyrocketed 904% to $32 billion in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple didn't fare as well amid macroeconomic headwinds, with its revenue dipping 3% to $383 billion in fiscal 2023, while its free cash flow rose 10%.\n\nAmazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. The retail giant has shown it can successfully navigate macroeconomic headwinds, making its shares an attractive long-term buy. Meanwhile, its considerable cash reserves indicate it has the financial resources to continue expanding and investing in high-growth industries like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon stock could enjoy nearly 70% upside in the near future\n\nIn dozens of countries, Amazon dominates e-commerce, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2028. The tech company will likely continue profiting from the sector's tailwinds for years.\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.\n\nMoreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to expand at a CAGR of 37% through 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nAmazon has entered the market by adding a range of AI tools to AWS and unveiling a new AI shopping assistant called Rufus on its retail site.\n\nThe tech giant is on an exciting growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates reflect it has significantly more potential than Apple. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis table shows Amazon's EPS could hit nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Apple's may reach close to $8 per share. When multiplying those figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Amazon's 42 and Apple's 28), you get a stock price of $294 for Amazon and $218 for Apple.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see Amazon's share price rise 68% and Apple's 20% by fiscal 2026. Combined with a reliable business model and solid positions in e-commerce and AI, Amazon is a no-brainer growth stock to buy over Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Macy's 'is melting away': Activist investor brings $6.6 billion bid to buyout battle",
        "content": "Macy’s (M) is looking to turn over a new leaf, but a battle to take it private is growing and doubts linger on whether it can engineer a comeback with its current plans.\n\nTony Spring, freshly minted as CEO a month ago, acknowledges that the business needs to change.\n\n\"We are not going to leave Macy's as it is today. It's foolhardy to think that leaving the business as it exists today is a recipe for success in the future,\" Spring told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSpring said the brand will \"evolve,\" adjust its product offering and integrate its physical and digital presence \"thoughtfully,\" but to do so \"with the appropriate action... time and support of our organization.”\n\nOne of its activist shareholders, private equity firm Arkhouse Management, isn't waiting for the results. After Macy's rejected its $5.8 billion bid with Brigade Capital Management in late January, the firm announced a new $6.6 billion bid on Sunday.\n\n“We remain frustrated by the delay tactics adopted by Macy’s Board of Directors and its continued refusal to engage with our credible buyer group. Nonetheless, we are steadfast in our commitment to execute this transaction,\" Arkhouse said in the release.\n\nPart of Arkhouse's continued pursuit of Macy's trace back to their belief that the company needs more fundamental changes to save its business.\n\nA week ago, Macy's announced a growth strategy, dubbed “A Bold New Chapter,” which includes closing 150 underperforming locations to reinvest in the remaining 350 stores.\n\n\"A good number\" of the closing stores are owned by the company, per Spring, which will allow Macy’s to tap into their real estate value. The strategy also includes improving its tech platform and opening a modest number of Bloomingdale’s, Bluemercury, and small format Macy’s store.\n\nThat plan does not go far enough, Arkhouse's managing director Gavriel Kahane told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“Incremental changes related to digital display systems, merchandising or even store closures have been tried before and are unlikely to deliver any material value to shareholders,” Kahane said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“They have their eye on marginal improvements. While they're focused there, their company is melting away,” added Kahane, who opined that Macy’s has \"an executive team and board that is focused on, you know, the sprinkles and the cherry, as opposed to the bowl of ice cream is a problem.\"\n\nArkhouse's new all-cash offer values Macy's at $24 per share, a 14.3% increase from its original proposal of $21 per share, and a 51.3% premium to Macy’s share price on Nov. 30, 2023. It's also a 33.3% premium to where the Macy's shares closed on Friday after market close, at $18.01.\n\nMacy's confirmed in a release that it received the proposal and will review it.\n\nAs of Friday's close, Macy’s stock has dropped 17% in the past year, compared to S&P 500’s 27% gain. It reported declines in both digital and same store sales for Q4 in its latest earnings report. After the new bid announcement, Macy's shares shot up 15% in Monday's pre-market trading.\n\nGrowing battle for Macy's future\n\nPrior to the second offer, Kahane told Yahoo Finance they have repeatedly engaged Macy's management on its first offer, which became public in early December. The firm discussed its financing sources in detail, and provided a letter and call with investment bank Jefferies to Macy's advisors.\n\nBut Arkhouse alleged that Macy's dragged its feet throughout the process, eventually leading it to put out a statement on Jan. 21 urging the management to act. An hour later, Macy's publicly rejected its offer, citing concerns with Arkhouse’s financing.\n\nKahane claimed that Macy’s had said it didn’t have more questions regarding Arkhouse’s financing in the Jefferies call weeks prior to the rejection.\n\nSpring, who has commented little on the unsolicited bids, said Macy’s team talked to over 60,000 customers to form its new strategy, and went through a seven month review to determine which stores to close.\n\n“I think the fact that we are focused on the customer, that we are focused on our colleagues, that we are making sure that we have the right content, and we are unlocking real estate value and we are increasing our dividends. I think that's what creates a much more compelling story about Macy's Inc.,” he said.\n\nKahane suggests its focus is to give shareholders a premium — via a buyout — then lean into the \"iconic\" retail brand and real estate.\n\nArkhouse has also started a proxy battle by nominating nine candidates to Macy's board of directors. The shareholder meeting date has yet to be announced.\n\nWall Street is in wait-and-see mode\n\nCurrently, Macy’s analyst ratings shake out to three buys, nine holds and two sells.\n\nCiti analyst Paul Lejuez maintained his neutral rating, but wrote in a note to clients that the new bid shows Arkhouse's conviction, and that Macy's \"is likely to more seriously consider the offer.\"\n\nOthers on the Street aren't sold on Macy's management's vision.\n\n\"There's a lot of skepticism around Macy's capability to deliver [on the growth plan]... Without seeing it in physical, cold, hard evidence, I think the jury's still out as to whether Macy's actually is going to make all these changes and whether they're going to be successful,\" GlobalData’s managing director of retail Neil Saunders told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\n\nUBS analyst Jay Sole reiterated its sell rating as he expects losses to continue.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, he wrote, “We are not yet convinced this new plan will solve challenges versus peers around price, product, and service.\"\n\nMorningstar analyst David Swartz holds a buy rating on shares, but acknowledges there are issues with the business.\n\n\"There has to be some concern, though, that the company just keeps getting smaller, the revenues going lower every year, closing 150 stores runs the risk of losing customers that may never come back. So it's unclear that there's really any growth plan in Macy's at all,\" said Swartz.\n\nYet there is \"real value at Macy's\" as the country’s largest department store chains, with major brands like Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein that rely on the retailer and are invested in its success, added Swartz.

Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nMacy’s will need to hustle quicker in the face of e-commerce dominance by Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT).\n\nSpring aims to make it \"easier to shop digitally and physically\" at Macy's, but Forrester analyst Sucharita Kodali told Yahoo Finance Live that declining digital sales, down 4% year-over-year in Q4, suggests the company is losing market share in that segment.\n\nHowever, both Spring and Kahane insist that Macy’s isn’t heading the way of Sears.\n\n“This is not a franchise that is distressed. It's a franchise that just needs to be modernized,” said Spring, who highlighted that Macy’s has “over a billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet with some of the best stores in the country.”\n\nKahane said Arkhouse isn’t just in it for the real estate, even though department store retail is “a troubled space.”\n\n“But it should be growing market share in that troubled space,” he said. “There are a lot of companies that thrive in industries [or] sectors that have secular headwinds in them.”\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Will Jeff Bezos Buy America's Most Venerable Space Company?",
        "content": "Call it the great cash out. Over just nine days in February, as Bloomberg reported on Feb. 20, Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos unloaded a total of 50 million shares of Amazon stock, netting $8.5 billion in proceeds -- nearly $1 billion per day of selling. Now inquiring minds want to know: What is Bezos planning to do with all the cash?\n\nOne possible answer: He's going to buy himself another space company.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance and Blue Origin: Together at last?\n\nFor the better part of a year now, rumors have swirled around the fate of United Launch Alliance, the rocket-launching joint venture formed by Boeing(NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) in 2005 -- and until SpaceX entered the national security launch market in 2016, America's primary means of delivering government satellites to orbit.\n\nArs Technica first broke the story back in March of 2023, and rumors soon sprang up about who might be bidding for ULA. Would Boeing -- or Lockheed -- try to buy out its partner? Might a second-tier space company like Northop Grumman(NYSE: NOC) try to expand its business by buying ULA? Or perhaps another defense giant, such as Textron(NYSE: TXT), would see buying ULA as a way to break into the space business itself?\n\nFrom the very start, however, one company always seemed the most likely to want to own ULA. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin was a rising star in space circles, and had a successful suborbital rocket and a budding space tourism business. It also built rocket engines for ULA, but had no actual, orbital rocket of its own with which to deliver payloads to orbit.\n\nWhat Blue Origin did have was a multi-multi-(multi)-billion-dollar founder in Jeff Bezos, and therefore easy access to the billions of dollars it would cost to take out ULA. And now, as the bidding for ULA finally nears its (presumed) end, wouldn't you know it?\n\nJeff Bezos is accessing those dollars himself, in a series of transactions yielding $8.5 billion. Cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nArs breaks the story again\n\nCiting unnamed sources, Ars Technica predicted last month that a sale of ULA was imminent, and might happen \"within a month or two.\" That timeline, coming so quickly on the heels of reports of Bezos selling Amazon stock, certainly does seem to suggest that Bezos (and Blue Origin) are laying the groundwork for a purchase of ULA.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the government would permit such a sale.\n\nOn the one hand, buying ULA would give Blue Origin immediate access to ULA's growing fleet of Vulcan Centaur orbital rockets -- for which Blue Origin itself already provides the engines -- as well as a host of contracts to launch the same for ULA customers. (Blue Origin therefore wouldn't have to wait to see if its planned New Glenn rocket can make a successful flight to enter the space race immediately.) At the same time, winning Bezos as a backer would give ULA an immediate cash infusion as it works to upgrade its technology to better compete with Elon Musk and SpaceX.\n\nOn the other hand, though, with Blue Origin so close to testing New Glenn, the U.S. Air Force is on the cusp of having three companies to choose from when picking its rocket rides -- and three companies bidding against each other to help keep prices down. Allowing ULA to merge into Blue Origin would derail that plan, at the very moment it might begin paying off for the government.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nI don't know about you, but if I were a government regulator right now, I'd be thinking that's a very good argument -- albeit a self-interested one -- for forbidding a merger between Blue Origin and ULA to proceed. If Boeing and Lockheed really feel compelled to sell their joint venture, I'd be inclined to agree to a sale to Textron, certainly, to Northop, probably, or to almost any other would-be buyer, possibly.\n\nThe one option I wouldn't want to see under any circumstances, though, is a purchase of ULA by Blue Origin.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon.com, NVIDIA, Energy Transfer, The Progressive and Synopsys",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 4, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Energy Transfer LP ET, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Synopsys Inc. SNPS.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop 5 Momentum Stocks for March After an Impressive February\n\nWall Street ended an impressive February, marking the fourth consecutive positive month for all three major stock indexes. Last month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – rallied 6.1%, 5.2% and 2.2%, respectively. In fact, the Dow posted its first four-month winning streak since May 2021.\n\nU.S. stock markets have maintained their northward journey in 2024 after witnessing an astonishing 2023. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have advanced 3.4%, 7.5% and 9%, respectively.\n\nMomentum Likely to Continue\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. economy grew at a clip of 3.2% in fourth-quarter 2023, well above the initial consensus estimate of 2%. The U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Feb 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession.\n\nThe headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index rose 0.3% month over month in January and 2.4% annually. The December numbers were a rise of 0.1% month over month and 2.6% year over year.\n\nThe core PCE price index (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.4% month over month and 2.8% annually in January, while the respective December numbers were 0.1% and 2.9%. Notably, the core PCE price index is the Fed’s most favored inflation gauge. The annual increase of the core PCE inflation rate in January was the lowest since February 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, personal income increased unexpectedly by 1% in January compared with the consensus estimate as well as December’s reading of 0.3%. Personal consumption expenditure increased 0.2% in January in line with the consensus estimate. However, the reading of January reflects a sharp decline from a 0.7% rise in December. The personal savings rate in January came in at 3.8%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently shows a 66.3% probability of the first cut of the existing Fed funds rate in the June FOMC meeting. The interest rate derivative tool also shows two more rate cuts by the end of 2024.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nAt this stage, it will be prudent to invest in momentum stocks. We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital >$45 billion) that have strong momentum for February. These companies have strong potential for 2024 too.\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A or B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from the momentum in Prime and AWS. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips to China for security reasons.\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, suggesting an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current fiscal year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nEnergy Transfer LP owns and operates diversified portfolios of energy assets primarily in the United States. ET is a publicly traded limited partnership whose core operations include complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets, crude oil, natural gas liquids and refined product transportation and terminalling assets, NGL fractionation and various acquisition and marketing assets.\n\nEnergy Transfer has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 18.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe Progressive Corp. continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for PGR’s growth.\n\nPolicies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.\n\nPGR’s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $2.96 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38. The bottom line improved 97.3% year over year. Operating revenues of $16.6 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3% and increased 23.2% year over year.\n\nThe Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.7% and 45.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nSynopsys Inc. is benefiting from solid design wins due to a robust product portfolio. Growth in the hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for SNPS’ Fusion Compiler product is boosting its top line.\n\nThe growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects for SNPS. Moreover, the rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things and big data is driving investments in new computer and machine-learning architectures.\n\nSynopsys has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.2% and 21.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2024).

        "title": "Billionaire Dan Loeb Has 27% of His Third Point Portfolio in 3 Brilliant \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks, but Completely Sold Out of Another",
        "content": "Daniel Loeb is something of an iconic figure in the annals of Wall Street. The billionaire is CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb secured his place in investor history by starting Third Point with just $3 million in seed money -- collected from family and friends -- and parlaying that into a $6 billion financial empire. In 2022, Loeb made the list of the \"Best Hedge Fund Managers of All Time.\"\n\nSo when Loeb talks, Wall Street listens.\n\nOver the past year, Loeb's Third Point's holdings have been heavily weighted toward the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. The common thread that unites these industry leaders is artificial intelligence (AI). They were also all among the top performers in the Nasdaq Composite last year:\n\nNvidia: up 239%. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): up 194%. Tesla: up 102%. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): up 81%. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): up 58%. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): up 57%. Apple: up 48%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLoeb has made no bones about the onset of generative AI, calling it \"transformative\" and saying \"profound economic upheaval\" coming. \"We believe generative and other forms of AI could compare to the Industrial Revolution but compressed into a period of months and years rather than decades,\" he said.\n\nLet's look at which Magnificent Seven stocks dominated his portfolio in the fourth quarter and which one he sold completely out of.\n\n1. Microsoft: 11.5% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft earned its place on Loeb's list thanks to a quick pivot to embrace AI. The company integrated AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its existing products and services. However, the biggest potential opportunity comes from its AI assistant, Copilot, which helps streamline and automate a variety of tasks, significantly enhancing worker productivity. Demand for the product has been robust.\n\nLoeb has minced no words about its potential. \"Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's worth noting that Loeb trimmed his position in Microsoft by more than 9% during the quarter -- but the position is actually larger than when the quarter began. Why? The stock jumped 19% during the fourth quarter, so even as Loeb took a little off the top, the total value of his Microsoft holdings grew.\n\nAt 34 times forward earnings, Microsoft might seem a little pricey, but given its pole position in AI, it's deserving of a premium.\n\n2. Amazon: 9.7% of holdings\n\nLoeb's stake in Amazon shouldn't be a surprise, as he's held the position for years. In early 2022, when the company's market cap was $1.6 trillion, Loeb stated that he believed there was more than $1 trillion in \"untapped value\" in Amazon. He estimates that its online retail business was worth more than $1 trillion alone, while its cloud infrastructure business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- was worth more than $1.5 trillion.\n\nFurthermore, Loeb has argued that \"the most direct consequence\" of the accelerating adoption of generative AI is that it \"will drive faster revenue growth\" for cloud infrastructure services providers -- including Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. He went on to say that such services \"are the 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit\" no matter who wins the AI revolution.\n\nLoeb trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% during the fourth quarter, but -- as with Microsoft -- the value of the position increased. This was thanks to Amazon's stock price gains of 20% during the fourth quarter.\n\nHowever, at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still very much a bargain.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: 6.2% of holdings\n\nIn keeping with Loeb's big bets on the Magnificent Seven and AI, he established a sizable position in Meta Platforms in the third quarter and added again in Q4. Meta's ties to AI are well established, as the company has long used these advanced algorithms to help target its advertising while surfacing relevant content for users on its various social media sites. Furthermore, the recovery of the advertising market is still ongoing, representing additional upside potential for Meta.\n\nThere's also Meta's foray into generative AI with its Large Language Model Meta AI, which is available on all the major cloud platforms. This represents a new source of revenue for the company.\n\nWhile he hasn't explained his reasoning, Loeb obviously believes the stock is still a good value. While not addressing Meta specifically, Loeb's penchant for \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations\" is well documented. Indeed, Meta Platforms stock was selling for 24 times earnings to close out 2023, a discount to the S&P 500, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.\n\n4. Alphabet: 0% of holdings\n\nLoeb closed out of his entire position in Alphabet, selling all 900,000 shares of Class A stock valued at roughly $125 million at the end of the quarter. Loeb has been mum as to his mindset, but broader portfolio shifts might provide some insight. In addition to Alphabet and trimming his Microsoft and Amazon holdings, Loeb significantly reduced his stake in other technology stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intercontinental Exchange, and Uber, among others. At the same time, the billionaire investor initiated positions in several utilities, including Verizon and Vistra, while increasing his stake in Pacific Gas & Electric. This suggests Loeb was rebalancing his portfolio and saw greater opportunities in utility stocks, particularly given the epic run in tech stocks over the past year.\n\nTo be clear, I believe Loeb made a mistake selling out of Alphabet. It stands to benefit from the advertising rebound and the same AI tailwinds that will drive the other Magnificent Seven stocks higher. Furthermore Alphabet is selling at just 24 times earnings, a fair discount to the market.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Amazon.com fair value estimate is US$241 Amazon.com's US$178 share price signals that it might be 26% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 18% higher than Amazon.com's analyst price target of US$204\n\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$61.6b US$77.6b US$96.6b US$103.9b US$118.3b US$129.0b US$138.1b US$145.8b US$152.5b US$158.5b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x18 Analyst x19 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Est @ 9.04% Est @ 7.01% Est @ 5.60% Est @ 4.60% Est @ 3.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1%  US$57.6k US$67.7k US$78.7k US$79.1k US$84.2k US$85.7k US$85.7k US$84.5k US$82.6k US$80.2k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$786b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$158b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.3%) = US$3.4t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.4t÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$1.7t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.035. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "content": "It is rare to find a company that has a dominant market-leading position in not one, but two completely separate industries, but Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is in that category. Its e-commerce platform is larger than its next 10 competitors combined, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a strong lead over the other major cloud platforms.\n\nAs my colleague Sean Williams pointed out in a recent article, no fewer than eight billionaire investors scooped up shares of Amazon in the fourth quarter of 2023, including Citadel's Ken Griffin. And it isn't just a recent phenomenon -- Warren Buffett-controlled Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon, as do notable billionaires David Tepper and Stanley Druckenmiller.\n\nNow, I would never suggest buying a particular stock just because billionaires are buying it, but there is a lot to like about Amazon. I've added shares to my own portfolio several times in the past couple of years, and I believe patient investors will be rewarded by this impressive business.\n\nRecent results are strong\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Amazon looked extremely strong. It handily beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, and thanks to CEO Andy Jassy's focus on efficiency, the company's net income jumped to $10.6 billion, compared to a $278 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue was 14% higher year over year, fueled by a particularly solid holiday season.\n\nAmazon's business expanded nicely all around. Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth accelerated by 1 percentage point sequentially, while North America and international e-commerce sales increased 13% and 17%, respectively. It's important to note that while nearly 85% of Amazon's revenue comes from e-commerce, AWS is responsible for the majority of the company's operating profits.\n\nAdvertising also continues to be an impressive high-margin revenue stream, with ad revenue jumping 27% year over year in the fourth quarter. Plus, it's worth noting that Amazon just started showing ads on Prime Video content in January, so this could keep growing rapidly.\n\nStory continues\n\nLots of growth potential ahead\n\nThere could be tremendous growth potential on both sides of Amazon's business. For starters, e-commerce only makes up about 15% of U.S. retail sales, and this percentage is even lower in some of the international markets where Amazon operates. And there's plenty of long-tailed potential to expand the advertising business.\n\nOn the AWS side, the global cloud computing market is expected to quadruple from 2023 levels by the end of the decade, becoming a $2.4 trillion market by that point.\n\nAWS could have an especially big opportunity as generative AI technology evolves. Management said that there has been a lot of interest in AWS' generative AI products, such as its \"Q\" chatbot for businesses, and Jassy said that AI could drive \"tens of billions of dollars\" in revenue over the next few years. Amazon develops its own AI chips and has a platform to build AI applications, among other initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, it isn't just that Amazon's business has lots of room to grow. It also has ample opportunity to improve efficiency and expand its margins, especially on the e-commerce side. The rapid growth of advertising should certainly help, and Amazon is also making efficiency improvements in its fulfillment network. A continued focus on efficiency is a big priority for Jassy.\n\nHow big could Amazon get?\n\nAmazon is one of the \"Magnificent 7\" companies, and with a $1.8 trillion market cap, it's one of the largest businesses in the world already. However, there's a solid case to be made that Amazon could double or even triple in size by the end of the decade if it can execute on both its growth and profitability opportunities. While there's a lot that can happen, I wouldn't be shocked to see Amazon ultimately become the first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Here Are Warren Buffett's Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Picks",
        "content": "Famed investor Warren Buffett isn't known as a technology guru; his reputation comes from opportunistically buying and holding longtime blue chip stocks in Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company, which is worth nearly a trillion dollars today.\n\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is sneakily invested very heavily, I might add, in artificial intelligence (AI). The top four AI stocks by position size represent nearly half the total portfolio!\n\nSo, feast your eyes on Buffett's top four AI stocks:\n\n1. Apple\n\nWarren Buffett isn't afraid to let a winning investment become a large piece of Berkshire's portfolio. Look no further than iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The stock, which Buffett first bought in 2016, has grown to 44.2% of the portfolio. Nonetheless, Apple is a bonafide AI stock, and Buffett has only sold minimal shares despite sitting on tremendous unrealized gains today. Why? Buffett has credited fierce customer loyalty, quipping that people would give up their second car for an iPhone.\n\nTech companies, Apple included, are investing in AI and combining it with their consumer-facing products. Apple has already implemented AI into the iOS experience for creature comforts, like Siri assistance, facial recognition, content recommendations, and more. However, Tim Cook recently shared at an event that Apple is prioritizing investments in generative AI. It recently shut down its electric car project and will shift employee resources to Apple's AI division. Buckle up for the future.\n\n2. Moody's\n\nCorporate credit and analytics firm Moody's(NYSE: MCO) is more similar to Buffett's known style. Berkshire has owned Moody's stock since 2000, and it has been a very successful investment over the years. It's a much smaller piece of Berkshire's portfolio at 2.5%, but then again, Moody's is a much smaller company than Apple. Berkshire's stake represents 13.5% ownership in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoody's analyzes data to rate corporate credit and sell market research. Artificial intelligence is a natural progression for a company like Moody's. The business possesses invaluable data from decades of operations and uses OpenAI and Azure to build models for that data. Moody's evolution to more tech-driven data analytics is critical to maintaining its stellar reputation in the financial markets. Moody's has grown revenue for 64 consecutive quarters, a testament to the company's durability.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nTech giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock Buffett got into late; he didn't add shares to Berkshire's portfolio until 2019. However, the stock has more than doubled since then, showing that it's hardly ever too late to invest in great businesses. Amazon has built a reputation as an innovator. After becoming the dominant e-commerce company in America, Amazon has since built a leading cloud platform and streaming service and is now leaning into AI.\n\nLike Apple, Amazon is using generative AI in its consumer-facing businesses. E-commerce customers can view a product, and AI will summarize buyers' product reviews into shortened summaries to save time. In AWS, Amazon is amassing massive resources, including Nvidia chips and its own, to give cloud customers the tools to build AI applications. Amazon's ability to tie AI into its business could support long-term growth in e-commerce and cloud -- industries with gas left in the tank.\n\n4. Snowflake\n\nData cloud and analytics company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) is a unique Buffett AI stock in that it's the only one Berkshire Hathaway has been invested in since day one. The holding company participated in Snowflake's public offering in 2020 and has held the stock since. It's also the smallest position of the companies on this list and represents just 0.3% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nSnowflake could become an enormous company in the AI era. The company's cloud platform stores and organizes data, allowing customers to easily search and integrate it with third-party apps, all through the cloud. Additionally, Snowflake operates a data marketplace where customers can share data and buy access to third-party data sets to combine with their own.\n\nData is fundamentally the building block of AI as it's all trained on data. That makes Snowflake a potentially crucial party to AI moving forward, and it's noteworthy that Berkshire jumped into the stock early.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Spectacular Warren Buffett Stocks That are No-Brainer Buys for 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has scored incredible investing wins over the years by picking great businesses with powerful competitive advantages. To put the Oracle of Omaha's track record in perspective, if you bought $1,000 worth of Berkshire shares when Buffett purchased a controlling stake in the business and became its CEO in May 1965, you would today own stock worth roughly $34.3 million.\n\nOf course, Berkshire's current massive size makes it unlikely that its stock will deliver a performance like that again any time this century. With a market capitalization of $889 billion, it ranks as the world's eighth-most-valuable company. Delivering exponential growth becomes far more difficult at that level.\n\nBut taking some pages out of Buffett's investing playbook can still be a great way to score market-beating returns, and two Motley Fool contributors think following the Oracle of Omaha's lead on these two stocks below would be a great way to strengthen your portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe AI revolution will power big wins for Amazon\n\nKeith Noonan: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest online retail company. It's also the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services.\n\nThough it accounts for the large majority of the company's revenues, Amazon's e-commerce business actually does not account for most of its profits. Because of its high operating costs, the online retail unit generates relatively low profit margins. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business is far more profitable, bringing in roughly 67% of the company's $36.9 billion in operating income last year.\n\nBut as Amazon continues to leverage economies of scale and takes advantage of new technologies, it should be able to achieve far better margins from its e-commerce business. Notably, wider use of artificial intelligence (AI) should provide an incredible performance catalyst for the already hugely successful company.\n\nAI will likely pave the way for increased automation at the company's warehouses. It could also open the door for self-driving vehicles and autonomous-delivery technologies. As a result, Amazon's e-commerce operating costs could fall dramatically -- and its profits could skyrocket.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the growing demand for AI is already powering strong performance for AWS. AI applications are being built, launched, and scaled on the company's cloud infrastructure. As more applications are created and used, demand for that cloud infrastructure will continue to rise.\n\nFor long-term investors seeking AI growth stocks that offer an attractive risk-reward profile, Amazon has the makings of a great buy right now.\n\nCoca-Cola has developed strong customer relationships\n\nParkev Tatevosian: To me, in order for a stock to be a no-brainer investment, I must feel confident that the company will be around for at least another two decades. Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) certainly fits that bill. The beverage giant has been delighting customers for roughly a century, and it's reasonable to assume it will be around for several decades more, at least. Importantly, Coca-Cola serves customers in a way that generates lucrative profits for shareholders.\n\nIn 2023, its revenue totaled $45.7 billion while its operating income totaled $13 billion. This means that after covering all the expenses involved in serving customers those tasty beverages they have come to love, Coca-Cola's operating profit margin was a refreshing 28.4%.\n\nThe proven capability to generate billions in sales at lucrative profit margins can go a long way toward relieving investors' concerns about the risks of investing. Certainly, billions in annual profits attracted Buffett to Coca-Cola stock. The underlying reasons that those profits keep flowing are management's skill in operating the business effectively, combined with consumers' brand loyalty and their steady consumption habits. KO PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nI am usually willing to pay a higher price to invest in companies like Coca-Cola because of the high chance they will be around for the long term. Fortunately, Coca-Cola's valuation is not too expensive. Currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20, Coca-Cola's stock has lately been at the lower end of the range it has occupied for the last several years. Investors who buy Coca-Cola stock today reasonably expect their investment to be worth more 20 or 30 years from now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "To those caught in the still-inflating \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stock bubble, it's a worthy endeavor to remember there are 493 other potential equities to invest in within the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nIndustrials, healthcare, and more are there for the picking!\n\nAnd outside of the S&P 500, there could be great investing opportunities in private equity, Treasurys, and hey, maybe even classic cars, if that's your thing.\n\nPut it all together, and this is what's known as diversification— a tried-and-true wealth-building approach tested by millionaires and billionaires alike, life and business strategist Tony Robbins touted.\n\n\"I would just say maintain diversification. We all heard it a million times,\" Robbins told Yahoo Finance at its New York City headquarters (see video above).\n\nThe six-foot-six author, who recently released \"The Holy Grail of Investing,\" says it's a reminder served up by longtime friend and vaunted investor, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. By diversifying, an investor can better reduce correlations between investments — and bring down the potential risk.\n\nKnown for his ultra-high-energy seminars, Robbins, who has a reported net worth of more than $600 million, warned against the AI hype bubble.\n\n\"I am concerned about it as well,\" Robbins said about investors' infatuation with Magnificent Seven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThe diversification reminder couldn't come at a better time as the Magnificent Seven trade has become hyper-correlated and is mostly moving in a singular direction — up and to the right.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven now makes up some 30% of the S&P 500's market cap, in part powered by a hearty reaction to AI chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report a week ago. Said market reaction has Wall Street analysts tripping over themselves to ratchet up profit forecasts, essentially feeding more upward momentum in the group's stock prices.\n\nStory continues Life and business strategist Tony Robbins (left) reminds investors that diversification is important in an interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (right). (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nDuring the past three months, Magnificent Seven earnings estimates have been revised higher by a lofty 7%, with its margins going up by 86 basis points, said Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\nThe average Magnificent Seven stock is up 14% this year, according to Yahoo Finance calculations. Nvidia has led the way with a 60% advance, while Tesla (TSLA) has dropped 23%.\n\nOver the past year, two of the Magnificent Seven companies have seen triple-digit-percentage gains — Nvidia at 239% and Meta (META) at 184%. The S&P 500 is up a very respectable 29% during that time.\n\nSome on the Street are finally beginning to call a timeout on the Magnificent Seven, with reasonable explanations that a reasonable investor should ponder.\n\n\"Elevated expectations and concentrated positioning create a high bar for the Magnificent 7 to beat,\" strategists at JPMorgan Asset Management contended in a new client note. \"AI will be investable for the long-haul and its beneficiaries will include far more than chipmakers.\"\n\nThey added that a soft economic landing and declining interest rates later this year stand to \"bode well for a catch up\" by sectors and companies left behind in last year's rally.\n\nAn argument could be made that not every Magnificent Seven member delivered blowout fourth quarters and outlooks to justify their stock's near-record valuation. Tony Robbins quote\n\nApple's (AAPL) performance in China was weak. The March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), it missed estimates on ad revenue, the core of its business. Tesla's quarter and its Elon Musk-led earnings call were littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — in the near term — that all its AI efforts are going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street. Stripping out the announcement of its first-ever dividend, Meta's quarter was okay — but it also jacked up its 2024 capital expenditures a ton, which could weigh on margins and cash flow.\n\nThe quarters out of Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia have been universally seen as huge.\n\n\"I've done everything in my life by saying success leaves clues. Find the best in the world. Figure out exactly what they do, do the same thing, and your chances of success go up a hundredfold,\" Robbins said.\n\nThe best investors in the game stay diversified — and not by buying seven tech companies that, at times, compete for the same customers.\n\nGive it a thought.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Wagering on tech stocks involves investing in the vanguard of AI innovation, a sector poised to redefine our digital future. As businesses globally harness the power of AI to push the boundaries of what’s possible, tech stocks emerge as gateways to participate in the next revolution in tech. The fascination with these stocks continues to grow as AI unfolds its transformative power across multiple industries, signaling a new era of digital evolution.\n\nThe shift towards AI-driven technologies marks a major step-change reminiscent of the internet’s explosive growth in the mid-90s. Moreover, Wedbush Securities disagrees with the AI bubble argument, pointing to a foundational shift in the tech sphere, with AI at the forefront. Hence, it’s arguably the best time for investors eyeing tech stocks to back companies shaping an AI-driven future in our daily lives and work.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) never ceases to amaze with its innovative prowess and evolving ability. Due to its pioneering advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) throughout 2023, MSFT stock saw an incredible 58% uptick in value. That wasn’t merely a fleeting success, as it looks to layer AI into its timeless software suite.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, Microsoft’s impressive financials are already benefitting from its AI investments. That shows in its recent quarterly showing, where it posted a stellar $890 million top-line beat and a 16 cents per-share earnings beat. The integration of ChatGPT-like functions into Bing and the Office365 suite, along with the launch of Microsoft 365 Copilot, points to a massive growth runway ahead for the firm. Additionally, the estimates of direct and indirect sales boosts from AI products, including a potential $10 billion incremental annual sales from Copilot, underscore Microsoft’s growth prospects. Given these dynamics, MSFT stock remains one of the top tech stock picks, offering immense upside potential ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL), a storied player in enterprise software and cloud services, is making significant inroads in the AI space. Its focus on AI cloud infrastructure is a game-changer, likely to increase cost efficiencies for its clients significantly. The company’s latest quarterly showing underscores this direction, with cloud revenues surging 25% year-over-year (YOY) to $4.8 billion, marked by a notable 52% jump in cloud infrastructure revenue.\n\nMoreover, it is expanding its AI cloud positioning by expanding its global footprint with the construction of 100 new data centers for Microsoft while enhancing 66 existing ones. Its enriched AI portfolio, accessible through its cloud marketplace, is a testament to its forward-looking approach towards democratizing AI tools for businesses globally. With such dynamic growth and strategic positioning, Tipranks’ analysts point to an 11% upside in ORCL stock from its current price while assigning a Moderate Buy rating.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNew York-based global payments giant American Express (NYSE:AXP) wrapped up another impressive year, thriving on the back of rising interest rates. Demonstrating robust financial health, it recently posted its fourth-quarter (Q4) results, with an 11% bump in sales from the prior year and a remarkable 23% surge in net income to $1.93 billion. That performance is a testament to the resilience of consumers, who remained unfazed amid non-essential cutbacks. Hence, for fiscal year 2023, American Express notched a record sales figure of $60.5 billion, achieving 14% growth in EPS to $11.21, buoyed by higher retail credit card rates and consumer spending.\n\nConsequently, the firm announced a generous 17% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to 70 cents per share. Looking ahead, the management remains optimistic, projecting a revenue growth of 9% to 11% for fiscal 2024, with anticipated EPS ranging between $12.65 and $13.15. That outlook underscores American Express’ strategic positioning for sustained growth and long-term profitability.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a powerful AI, and it presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Picking up from where it left off last year, Meta Platforms continued to shine in 2024, marked by four consecutive quarters of top-and-bottom-line beats. In its most recent quarter, it announced its first-ever dividend and $40.1 billion in sales, which surpassed estimates by $940.6 million.\n\nFurthermore, Meta’s maverick CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is deeply invested in AI. His investment in the sphere is shown by Meta’s development of its in-house Artemis AI chip and board additions like Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) Hock E. Tan and John Arnold. Also, his competitive stance is further illustrated in his challenge to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the lucrative metaverse-gear space, highlighting the Quest 3 VR headset’s affordability and superiority over Apple’s pricier Vision Pro VR headset. That move not only showcases Meta’s competitive positioning but also its ambition to lead in the adoption of AI and the metaverse.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a bellwether in the streaming sphere, which continues to outperform in a competitive sector. With an array of content that spans movies, TV shows and documentaries, the streaming giant has maintained its growth trajectory despite competitive pressures. Introducing new players during the pandemic did little to shake its stronghold. Instead, Netflix continues to expand its subscriber base at a healthy pace.\n\nIn its Q4 earnings report, Netflix posted a commendable 13% YOY increase in total revenue and subscriber numbers. Moreover, in the past four consecutive quarters, it has beaten earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. However, in Q4, it fell short by 11 cents, on its bottom line.\n\nNevertheless, its growth trajectory mirrors its results during the pandemic’s peak, mainly due to the company’s successful crackdown on password sharing. NFLX stock is up over 40% in the past six months alone, and its exciting content lineup positions it for further gains.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM), a customer relationship management (CRM) trailblazer, is another tech giant leveraging AI to enhance its cloud computing offerings. The company recently unveiled AI-driven products, such as its Einstein Copilot. The Einstein Copilot is the company’s new generative AI-powered conversational assistant, developed to enhance every Salesforce application.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s financial performance speaks volumes, with its Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $2.29, besting analyst estimates by two cents. Also, revenue saw a healthy 10.9% YOY increase to $9.29 billion, surpassing forecasts by $70 million. Notably, subscription and support revenues climbed to $8.75 billion, marking a 12% YOY growth.\n\nMoreover, the company initiated a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share and a significant increase in its share repurchase program by $10 billion. As we advance, the company sets its full-year fiscal 2025 sales guidance between $37.7 billion and $38.0 billion, indicating an 8% to 9% growth YOY.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nECommerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is on a remarkable growth trajectory, with its latest quarterly results showing significant gains bolstered by holiday sales. Consequently, AMZN is up roughly 11% this month and 30% in the past six months.\n\nAmazon’s success lies in its diversified business model, which covers multiple tech verticals, including advertising, cloud computing, subscription services and other areas. That diversification has yielded substantial sales from its eCommerce operations and its cloud computing juggernaut in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is leveraging AI to solidify its leadership in the cloud sector. With its massive internal reserves, Amazon is looking to go full-steam ahead with its commitment to AI innovation through advanced computing chips, including Graviton4 and Trainium2. AWS continues to shine financially, with its sales up 13% YOY to $24.2 billion and advertising revenue growing 27% to $14.7 billion. Also, its eCommerce segment witnessed a 14% increase. Hence, Amazon’s dominance in the market is clear, offering tremendous upside to investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March",
        "content": "Warren Buffett can't remember any period since his first stock purchase on March 11, 1942, that he hasn't had a majority of his net worth in U.S. stocks. That's what he recently wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, adding, \"And so far, so good.\"\n\nThe multibillionaire continues to own many great stocks that other investors should like, too. But some of them especially stand out. Here are three Buffett stocks to buy hand over fist in March.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nBuffett didn't make the initial call to buy Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). One of his two investment managers initiated Berkshire's position in the e-commerce and cloud services company in 2019. However, Buffett has been a longtime admirer of Amazon and expressed regret that he hadn't bought the stock sooner.\n\nIn several ways, Amazon is even more attractive now than it was when Berkshire first bought the stock. For example, the company is arguably now focused on boosting profitability and free cash flow more than it has ever been.\n\nIts efforts on this front are bearing fruit. The company's earnings jumped to $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 from only $300 million in the prior-year period.\n\nAmazon generated free cash flow of $36.8 billion over the trailing 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2023, compared to an outflow of $11.6 billion over the trailing 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nI'd argue that the company's prospects are better now, too. The rise of generative AI has made it more important than ever for organizations to move their apps and data to the cloud. As the leading cloud services provider, Amazon should benefit greatly from this trend.\n\n2. Lennar\n\nBerkshire exited its stake in one major U.S. homebuilder in the fourth quarter, but the conglomerate's portfolio still includes two homebuilders. I especially like Lennar(NYSE: LEN)(NYSE: LEN.B).\n\nBuffett isn't as much of a value investor as he used to be. However, valuation remains an important factor in his buying decisions. Lennar looks dirt cheap, with its shares trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of only 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch a low valuation wouldn't be appealing if the builder's prospects were dismal, but that's not the case. The U.S. continues to face a significant housing shortage, and the only solution to this challenge is to build more houses. As one of the largest homebuilders in the country, Lennar is well positioned to profit as new homes are constructed.\n\nIt just might have a catalyst on the way in the near term. The Federal Reserve has hinted that interest rate cuts are coming at some point in 2024. If and when the Fed cuts rates, mortgage rates should also fall. That could provide a nice boost to the housing market -- and to stocks like Lennar.\n\n3. Occidental Petroleum\n\nIn his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett listed Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) as one of the stocks that his company would probably own \"indefinitely.\" It's also a stock that he will likely continue to buy aggressively.\n\nBerkshire currently owns 28.2% of Occidental, up from 27.8% at the end of 2023. The conglomerate, though, has regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of Oxy. Buffett noted in his recent shareholder letter that Berkshire's warrants give it the option \"to materially increase our ownership\" in Occidental over the next few years.\n\nWhy does Buffett like Occidental so much? First, he prizes the company's \"vast oil and gas holdings\" in the U.S. Second, he believes that Occidental is on the right track with its carbon capture initiatives.\n\nI think the Oracle of Omaha is right on both counts. Oil prices are likely to rise in the future, boosting Occidental's share price. And although Oxy's direct air capture technology for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere remains unproven, it could be a huge moneymaker for the company down the road.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Billionaires David Tepper and George Soros Both Own These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks. Should You?",
        "content": "Few investors in history have been as successful as David Tepper and George Soros. Tepper's net worth stands close to $20.6 billion. Soros' net worth is roughly $6.7 billion today and was a lot more before he shifted $18 billion to his Open Society Foundation in 2018. Both men's fortunes were built largely as a result of shrewd hedge fund investments through the years.\n\nTepper and Soros have quite different investing styles. They agree on some things, though. Both billionaire investors own these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in their respective hedge funds.\n\nNearly all of the Magnificent Seven are covered\n\nBetween Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Soros Fund Management, nearly all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are covered. The only outlier is Tesla, which neither hedge fund owns. However, there's not much overlap between Tepper's and Soros' portfolios.\n\nTepper has made big bets on tech stocks. Unsurprisingly, he has invested in most of the Magnificent Seven. Meta Platforms ranks as his biggest holding, followed closely by Microsoft. He also still owns a significant position in Nvidia despite selling nearly 23% of his stake in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSoros also owns quite a few tech stocks. But Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia aren't in his Soros Fund Management portfolio. Apple stands alone as the only Magnificent Seven stock that Soros owns that isn't also owned by Tepper.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Two\" in both Tepper's and Soros' portfolios\n\nThat leaves two of the Magnificent Seven that are in both Tepper's and Soros' portfolios. Both billionaires own shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nAmazon ranks as the third-largest position for Tepper's Appaloosa hedge fund. As of the end of 2023, it held 3.95 million shares of the e-commerce and cloud services company worth close to $600 million. Tepper increased his stake in Amazon by over 5.3% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoros Fund Management isn't nearly as heavily invested in Amazon. At the end of last year, it owned a little under 557,000 shares, valued at $84.6 million. The hedge fund reduced its stake in Amazon during the fourth quarter of 2023 by 27%.\n\nAlphabet was Appaloosa's 10th-biggest holding at year-end. The hedge fund owned 2.3 million shares, worth a little over $324 million. But Tepper sold more than 16% of Appaloosa's stake in Alphabet during the fourth quarter.\n\nSoros' hedge fund also sold some of its position in Alphabet, reducing its stake by roughly 13%. But the stock still ranked as the fourth-largest holding in Soros' portfolio with 1.22 million shares, worth $170 million.\n\nShould you own Alphabet and Amazon, too?\n\nI don't think other investors should buy Alphabet and Amazon just because Tepper and Soros have positions in the stocks. However, when two of the most successful investors on the planet both own the same stocks, it's probably a good idea to pay attention.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon should profit for years to come from the generative AI boom. Organizations across the world will almost certainly continue to shift their IT spending from on-premises to the cloud to develop AI apps.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the top cloud services provider, while Alphabet's Google Cloud is gaining ground. Both of these cloud platforms should grow much larger over the next decade and beyond.\n\nEach of these companies should also benefit from the rising adoption of self-driving cars, especially robotaxis. Alphabet's Waymo unit is a leader in autonomous driving technology. Amazon's Zoox also operates an up-and-coming robotaxi service.\n\nThose are just two big tailwinds for Alphabet and Amazon. I predict that both stocks will make investors a lot of money over the next several years. Those investors will likely include Tepper and Soros, but they could include you, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Thrilling Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "Putting your money to work on Wall Street hasn't been for the faint of heart since this decade began. Since the start of 2020, all three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years, with the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) taking the brunt of the volatility. After losing 33% of its value during the 2022 bear market, the widely followed Nasdaq has surged 54% since the curtain opened on 2023 (as of the closing bell on Feb. 29).\n\nMore importantly, this week represented a milestone for the Nasdaq: It officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 in fully putting the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror. In other words, the Nasdaq Composite climbed to a fresh all-time closing high and decisively declared itself to be in a bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYet in spite of this record close, amazing deals can still be found -- especially when it comes to growth stocks.\n\nWhat follows are four thrilling growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nMastercard\n\nThe first exceptional growth stock you'll be kicking yourself for not scooping up while the Nasdaq Composite is still relatively early in the latest bull market cycle is payment processing titan Mastercard(NYSE: MA).\n\nInterestingly enough, Mastercard's biggest headwind also tends to be its most prominent catalyst. Financial stocks like Mastercard are cyclical. This is to say, they ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy. The thing is, periods of growth last substantially longer than recessions.\n\nWhereas three-quarters of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II resolved in under a year, a majority of expansions have endured multiple years. Buying Mastercard stock and simply being patient will allow investors to take advantage of the natural expansion of the U.S. economy and consumer/enterprise spending over time.\n\nSpeaking of expansion, Mastercard is looking at the potential for sustained double-digit earnings growth for as far as the eye can see. It's established itself as the clear No. 2 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and shouldn't have any trouble expanding organically or acquisitively into underbanked regions of the world, including Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I've pointed out, Mastercard's sole focus on payment facilitation is another competitive edge. Although I have little doubt it would be successful as a lender, becoming one would expose the company to credit delinquencies and loan losses. Sticking with payment processing means not having to set aside capital for loan losses, which is a big reason why the company's profit margin has stayed above 40%.\n\nThe valuation makes sense as well. While some investors might be scared off by a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33, the company's outsized earnings growth results in a price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1.6. That means there's plenty of upside left in Mastercard for patient, growth-seeking investors.\n\nPubMatic\n\nA second thrilling growth stock you'll regret not purchasing in the young Nasdaq bull market is fast-growing adtech company PubMatic(NASDAQ: PUBM). Despite shares of PubMatic soaring this past week, abundant upside still remains for investors with a long-term mindset.\n\nSimilar to Mastercard, the biggest challenge facing PubMatic is the health of the U.S. economy. PubMatic operates a cloud-based programmatic ad platform that helps publishing companies sell their digital display space. It relies on the willingness of advertisers to spend to drive its business, which ultimately means that it needs the U.S. economy to grow.\n\nBut, as noted, periods of growth stick around considerably longer than economic contractions. Historically, this has given ad-driven businesses exceptional long-term pricing power.\n\nWhat's even more important than a broad-based macro tailwind is that PubMatic is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the digitization of ads in video, mobile, and connected TV. These three channels represent sustained double-digit growth opportunities through at least the midpoint of the decade, if not well beyond. CEO Rajeev Goel noted in the company's fourth-quarter operating results, \"We believe we are at the early stages of a period of significant multiyear revenue growth and market share expansion.\"\n\nThe true turning point for PubMatic was the decision to build out its own cloud-based infrastructure, rather than relying on a third-party platform. As the company's sales have scaled, it's been able to hang on to more of its revenue. In short, it's a recipe for higher margins over time.\n\nWith its cash flow liable to soar in the coming years and the company's board recently approving a $100 million share repurchase program, all signs point to healthy upside to come for PubMatic. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nExelixis\n\nThe third eye-catching growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq finally pushing to a new all-time high is biotech stock Exelixis(NASDAQ: EXEL). Though Exelixis has a concentrated drug portfolio that's heavily reliant on sales from Cabometyx, there are numerous catalysts working in the company's favor.\n\nThe most exciting development for Exelixis is potential label expansion opportunities for Cabometyx. Already approved to treat first- and-second-line renal cell carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, positive late-stage trials involving cabozantinib (the scientific name for Cabometyx) for patients with advanced pancreatic and extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (in combination with Roche's Tecentriq), offer plenty of hope for expanded revenue streams in the years to come. Exelixis is working on dozens of clinical studies involving Cabometyx as a stand-alone or combination cancer treatment.\n\nThe abundant cash flow generated from the sale of Cabometyx has also allowed the company to reignite its internal growth engine. It's developing and advanced a couple of novel therapies into early clinical trials, and has forged a few collaborations to develop cancer therapeutics. By the latter half of the decade, Exelixis should see a well-diversified drug portfolio.\n\nInvestors needing another reason to pounce on Exelixis' stock need look no further than its exorbitant cash position. It closed out 2023 with $1.72 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which represents more than enough capital to fuel internal innovation, collaborations, and possibly even acquisitions.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle with Exelixis is its inexpensive valuation. Between 2023 and 2027, Wall Street's consensus expects Exelixis to nearly quadruple its earnings per share. A multiple of just 15 times forward-year earnings is a bargain for this drug developer.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe fourth thrilling growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than e-commerce behemoth Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Despite a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggesting the U.S. could fall into a recession, Amazon looks perfectly positioned to thrive in the years to come.\n\nMost investors are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. If the U.S. were to dip into a recession, e-commerce sales would be expected to decline.\n\nHowever, Amazon generates very little of its operating income and cash flow from its low-margin online marketplace. The bulk of the company's cash flow and income originates from its ancillary operating segments, which includes Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services. These segments have shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nAWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative infancy, which bodes well for Amazon to sustain double-digit growth from this all-important, high-margin segment. Even though AWS generates only a sixth of the company's sales, it was responsible for 67% of Amazon's $36.9 billion in operating income last year.\n\nMeanwhile, advertising services has sustained at least a 22% year-over-year growth rate, looking back to the September 2022-ended quarter. Amazon is attracting in excess of 2 billion monthly visitors, many of which are motivated shoppers. This affords the company exceptional pricing power from merchants who want to get their message(s) in front of users.\n\nSubscription services is maintaining a growth rate of at least 13% on a year-over-year basis, too. Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscriptions in April 2021 and has likely added to this figure. Prime is an invaluable tool that helps keep users within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nYou might also be surprised to learn that Amazon is historically inexpensive relative to its cash flow. Opportunistic investors can grab shares right now for less than 13 times forward-year cash flow, which is well below the multiple of nearly 23 times cash flow Amazon has averaged over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon collects $140 billion in annual fees from sellers.  Now many are fuming over ‘crazy’ new fees they say tighten Amazon’s grip on their businesses",
        "content": "Things are about to get more complicated for many Amazon sellers—and Amazon customers may pay the price, literally.\n\nOver the next month, Amazon is implementing the latest in a series of new fees for businesses that sell goods on Amazon, in changes that the company says are designed to speed up shipping speeds for Amazon customers while reducing the costs of such initiatives. But a half-dozen top Amazon sellers told Fortune this week that the new fees are complex and expensive, and may force them to overhaul their businesses and seriously consider ceding more control of their supply chain to the tech giant at a time when it is facing a government lawsuit that alleges the company is already abusing its power over these merchants.\n\nAll of these sellers told Fortune that at least one of the new fees—called “the inbound placement service fee”—appears designed to pressure merchants to utilize a new Amazon service called AWD, or Amazon Warehousing and Distribution. Some of these merchants also said that this fee, coupled with another that Amazon will soon charge for low inventory levels, will force them to pass on price increases to Amazon customers.\n\n“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to sell on Amazon,” said Albert Grazi, a highly-rated Amazon seller of seven years who sells around $5 million of water filtration products on Amazon each year through brands like the Mist filter line. “You are getting squeezed from all sides.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson, Mira Dix, said in a statement: “By splitting what was a combined outbound fee into an inbound and outbound fee and adding a low-inventory-level fee, we will more closely align fees for sellers with our underlying costs while also providing sellers with more choices for how they use our services, giving them more transparency and control over their fulfillment costs. This allows us to create incentives for sellers to use our network more efficiently so we can share the cost savings.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe spokesperson said that “many” sellers will end up paying Amazon less per unit sold than they did previously, but none of the six top sellers who spoke to Fortune considered that a possibility for their business.\n\nWhile Amazon is increasingly thought of as a tech giant as much as a retailer—with significant AI investments, a massive cloud computing business in AWS, and a voice assistant that’s become a household name—about one-quarter of its total revenue, or $140 billion in 2023 alone—comes from the fees it charges these sellers to host their products and do the unsexy work of storing and shipping their goods. In exchange, small companies can build big businesses by easily accessing one of the largest customer bases in the world. But now Amazon wants even more.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has extracted a greater cut of sales from the small and midsize merchants who sell through its site, even as Amazon’s reliance on these sellers continues to grow. During the final three months of 2023, the proportion of total goods sold through Amazon that come from these sellers—rather than Amazon’s own inventory—crossed the 60% mark for the first time in company history. At the same time, from 2017 to 2022, the cut of revenue that Amazon takes from these sellers increased from around 40% to around 50%, according to the e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse.\n\nFeels like \"10 years’ worth of increases and changes\" in one shot\n\nSellers pay Amazon listing fees, advertising fees, and in many cases warehousing, shipping, and customer service fees through a service called Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, that assures their items will qualify for Prime shipping. Amazon’s third-party seller business—known as its Marketplace—is also highly profitable, the Federal Trade Commission has alleged, but just how profitable remains a secret that the company does not disclose.\n\nThe new inbound placement and low-inventory fees apply to sellers who already use FBA, but Amazon wants to play a role even earlier in their supply chain. In the past, an Amazon seller might import goods from overseas suppliers and then send all that inventory to a warehouse owned by a 3PL or third-party logistics company. From there, the 3PL will then ship out smaller segments of the seller’s inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers and potentially those of other retailers. But with Amazon Warehouse and Distribution, or AWD, Amazon is essentially trying to replace those 3PLs. (Amazon also runs another relatively new service called Amazon Global Logistics, or AGL, that charges sellers to transport a seller’s goods from overseas suppliers into a US Amazon fulfillment center.)\n\nOver the past two years, Amazon has also reorganized—or regionalized—its U.S. warehouse network to try to share inventory across eight regions to speed up delivery times and reduce transportation costs, in an effort to get more goods to customer doors faster and cheaper. With these new changes, if an Amazon seller is not willing to send goods from its own 3PL warehouse to at least four different Amazon fulfillment centers, Amazon will now charge an extra fee for every single item. The new placement fees will range anywhere from 21 cents to 68 cents per unit for standard-size goods, and 55 cents to $6 for bulky products. Pricing is based not only on the size and weight of an item, but also depending on how many fulfillment centers a seller will or won’t ship their items to. Of course, Amazon will waive these new fees if sellers decide to pay for AWD instead.\n\nGrazi, the Amazon seller, said it makes sense for Amazon to begin charging sellers to spread their inventory across the U.S. But, to him, the costs don’t net out.\n\n“It’s a very high fee,” he said. “It doesn't make sense how much money they are charging.”\n\nJudah Bergman, the CEO of Jool Baby, a baby-product company that does tens of millions in sales on Amazon annually, says the introduction of these new fees and others announced in December feel like “10 years’ worth of increases and changes in one.”\n\n“I’m very experienced on Amazon and I’ve spent so much time on this,” he said, “[but] for many items, I still don’t have clarity on how exactly I’m going to sell profitably yet. It’s crazy.” SUTTON COLDFIELD, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 19: A robot brings a pallet of items to employees for sorting at Amazon's Robotic Fulfillment Centre on December 19, 2023 in Sutton Coldfield, England. Launched in October, the 24/7 fulfillment center, equipped with cutting-edge robotics for sorting, packing, and shipping millions of items, has already employed 1,400 staff, as well as additional hires for the Christmas period. (Photo by Nathan Stirk/Getty Images)\n\nSellers now get penalized for low inventory—and for too much inventory\n\nBeyond the new inbound placement fees that go into effect March 1, on April 1 Amazon will also begin charging many sellers a fee if they don’t have four weeks of inventory in Amazon fulfillment centers. One problem, sellers told Fortune, is that Amazon also charges sellers for storing too much inventory in Amazon facilities.\n\n“You gotta precisely thread the needle to not get completely killed,” Bergman, the Jool Baby CEO, said of the low-inventory charges.\n\nAmazon’s solution? Again, sellers can avoid the low-inventory fees by giving Amazon even more control of their supply chain by utilizing AWD to replace a seller’s existing 3PL warehouse relationship.\n\n“It’s very clear they are carrot-and-stick-ing us into using AWD,” said a longtime, eight-figure apparel seller who requested anonymity out of a fear of reprisal for speaking candidly about Amazon’s actions.\n\nDifferent sellers had different reasons for not wanting to use AWD. Some simply didn’t want to give more control to Amazon, while another said they believe their current 3PL relationship will be cheaper. Two others said they’ve heard from peers who felt the service was not yet ready for prime time.\n\nSeveral of the sellers who spoke to Fortune said that the company’s marketplace has become a safer place to do business over the past year or two, with the company doing a better job of policing nefarious merchants who sabotage competitor listings. But the recent fee changes have them feeling resigned to the fact that a significant power imbalance remains.\n\n“I’m gonna comply and send [my inventory] into AWD,” Grazi said. “And that’s it.”\n\nDo you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Cadence Design Systems and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 1, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Cadence Design Systems CDNS and Amazon AMZN.\n\n\"It's a Bull Market You Know\": Top-Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend\n\nThis article's title, \"It's a bull market you know!\" is a quote from a famous investing book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, which accounts the life of famous speculator Jesse Livermore.\n\nThe book, which is a must read for any stock trader, details the wins and losses of Livermore's volatile life and shares many of his formative learning experiences. One of his earlier lessons occurred while he was hanging out at a brokerage firm he traded with. There he met a market veteran who went by the name Old Turkey.\n\nUp until this period Livermore was a very active trader, buying and selling shares at a high frequency, sometimes multiple times during the day. But this phrase from Old Turkey \"It's a bull market you know!\" stuck with Livermore.\n\nOld Turkey would repeat it over and while at first, he thought it was just a platitude he learned that it held much deeper insights than that. Instead of trading in and out of stocks, taking profits and waiting for a dip to buy again, this phrase was an encouragement to hold on to you winners for as long as possible.\n\nPersisting Bull Market\n\nBull markets often endure much longer than investors expect. In fact, the US stock market spends the vast majority of time in bull markets that steadily grind higher, climbing a wall of worry.\n\nThis insight deeply changed the way Livermore approached the market. Instead of quick profits he now focused on the big trends and owning the leading stocks for as long as the bull market persisted.\n\nAlthough Livermore's trading was marked by wild boom and busts, it was his overuse of leverage that was his Achilles heel. In fact, he would make huge profits riding these longer-term bull moves and occasional bear markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Market\n\nThe current market regime is one that has a litany of bullish tailwinds, and we are likely closer to the beginning of this bull market than the end. The factors include:\n\n- AI revolution: The hype is real – AI tech could be as influential as the internet has been and will make major contributions to productivity gains.\n\n- Strong economic growth: The US economy is showing above trend growth surprising nearly all economists on wall street.\n\n- Interest rate cuts: It won't be long before the Fed begins to lower rates again, beginning the expansionary cycle again.\n\nLeading Stocks\n\nOften, as a stock makes incredible gains, you will hear very loud voices talking about how \"it has gone too far!\" Just look at the commentary surrounding Nvidia, these traders have been saying this month after month, yet the stock pushes higher.\n\nLeading stocks lead for a reason, and in this current market they are leading because of growing sales and earnings. That is the opposite of hype and exactly what you want to see strong stocks do.\n\nAfter a little more than a year of using the Zacks Rank I have been continuously impressed by its ability to pick big winners. Nvidia and Meta Platforms sat on the list for the majority of 2023, when most analysts doubted them, yet they were the biggest winners in the S&P 500.\n\nThere are a handful of stocks sitting on the Zacks Rank right now that have performed very well recently and I think are likely to continue. They represent the secular economic trends of this economy, have strong business models, growing earnings and of course top Zacks Ranks.\n\nMeta Platforms and Nvidia are still on the top of the list, and both enjoy Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS for Nvidia are forecast to grow an incredible 30% annually for the next 3-5 years and Meta's are projected to climb 20% annually over the same period.\n\nThey also continue to show impressive relative strength against the market YTD.\n\nAnother company that is quietly making a significant contribution to the semiconductor and AI industry is Cadence Design Systems. The company builds software for designing chips and leads the space.\n\nSoftware within the semiconductor industry is a particularly appealing vertical. Semiconductor production is a very high capex intensive business, while software is a high margin low capex business. Candence Design enjoys gross margins of 90% and net margins of 26%.\n\nIn addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, CDNS also has a compelling technical trade setup. The price action of the stock has been forming a bullish consolidation, and a breakout should send the stock higher.\n\nAmazon is another leader that is likely to continue to lead. Both the ecommerce business and cloud services boast massive tailwinds with the expansion of online retail and digital transformation. Amazon web services dominates the cloud industry with 31% of the market share.\n\nAdditionally, its advertising business has exploded from seemingly nowhere and now contributes $60 billion a year to the top line annually. The emergence of this business shows that Amazon continues to execute at a high level as it enters new highly competitive industries.\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates are being upgraded significantly and EPS are expected to grow at a very high pace over the next 3-5 years. Earnings are projected to grow 28% annually over that time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere will be hiccups along the way, 5% and 10% corrections as the market continues higher, but don't let the bears scare you out of this market.\n\nIt's a bull market you know!\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +11% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of +161.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +40%. This estimate has changed +10.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.30 indicates a change of +30.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +10%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $142.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $641.11 billion and $715.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.5% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $169.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $1.01 for the same period compares with $0.21 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.23%. The EPS surprise was +24.69%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Tech Giants to Buy for Long-Term Gains as Nasdaq Thrives",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4%, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle in January, although finally, it closed the first month of 2024 on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index regained momentum in February finishing the month with a 6.1% rally. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 9% compared with a 7.5% gain of the S&P 500 and 3.4% of the Dow. Notably, all three major stock indexes saw the fourth consecutive month of positive ending.\n\nMeanwhile, on Feb 29, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% to close at 16,091.92, marking its first closing record since November 2021. Its peers the Dow and the S&P 500 posted several all-time highs on both an intraday and a closing basis in the first two months of this year. Now, the tech-heavy index has joined the bandwagon.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — along with a solid outlook provided by management, raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. (TSM) — the world's largest contract chipmaker — has projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales will reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite-listed technology behemoths namely NVIDIA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nMoreover, each stock’s long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate is well above the market’s benchmark S&P 500’s current long-term growth rate of 11.6%. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips in China for security reasons.\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, implying an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nAmazon.com has benefited from the Prime and AWS’s momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 28.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid its growth. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms reported fourth-quarter 2023 earnings of $5.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.35%. The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $40.11 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87% and jumped 24.7% year over year. META expects total revenues between $34.5 billion and $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Meta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 19.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicrosoft has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT were driven by the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and 18.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. SMCI’s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI emphasizes superior product design and uncompromising quality control to produce industry-leading serverboards, chassis and server systems.\n\nThese Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations. SMCI sells its server systems and components primarily through distributors, which include value-added resellers and system integrators, and to a lesser extent, to original equipment manufacturers.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Super Micro Computer has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of more than 100% and 83.8%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 55.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, chances are you're aware of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) that kicked off last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology, and prompted dozens of tech companies to pivot to the budding market.\n\nAccording to data from Grand View Research, the AI market hit close to $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to keep expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. That trajectory would see the industry hit nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAs a result, one of the smartest investing moves could be to dedicate a portion of your portfolio to AI in 2024, when the market is only just getting started. So here are two AI stocks that could go parabolic and offer consistent gains for years.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has massive potential in AI. The company got a late start in the industry, outrun last year by Nvidia, which snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. However, AMD is moving to challenge Nvidia's dominance soon and take its own slice of the lucrative industry.\n\nLast December, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI graphics processing unit (GPU), designed to provide an alternative to Nvidia's products. The new chip has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta as clients.\n\nHowever, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled.\n\nAMD posted fourth-quarter 2023 earnings on Jan. 30. Revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted revenue growth of 38%. Meanwhile, improvements in the PC market boosted AMD's client segment by 65% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a solid outlook over the long term, and earnings per share estimates reflect this. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows AMD's earnings could hit just above $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying this figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 49 yields a projected stock price of $352. If projections are correct, AMD's stock price could double by fiscal 2026.\n\nAnd with that, AMD's stock is a screaming buy before it goes parabolic.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nWhile AMD is an excellent way to invest in the hardware side of AI, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is quickly becoming a significant player in AI software. The company is the biggest name in e-commerce and cloud computing, granting it multiple use cases for AI and ways to bolster its business with the technology.\n\nAmazon is home to the world's largest cloud platform with Amazon Web Services (AWS), responsible for 31% of the cloud market. Cloud computing has become a crucial growth area for AI since these companies can leverage their massive data centers to steer the generative AI market in their favor.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Amazon has responded to the rising demand for AI by expanding AWS. In September, the company debuted Bedrock, a tool offering a range of models that customers can use to build generative AI applications.\n\nAWS also introduced CodeWhisperer, a platform that generates code for developers, and HealthScribe, a feature capable of transcribing patient-to-physician conversations.\n\nIn addition to improved cloud capabilities, AI could boost its e-commerce business, allowing Amazon to track shopping trends better and effectively recommend products to customers. The company is already implementing the technology on its retail site, recently unveiling an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that will improve the customer experience.\n\nIn Amazon's fourth quarter, revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating analyst estimates by nearly $4 billion. Meanwhile, the company's free cash flow skyrocketed 904% over the last year to $32 billion. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nAmazon has significant potential in AI over the long term, with the cash reserves to keep investing in its business. The table above shows that the retail giant's earnings could reach close to $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying that figure by Amazon's forward P/E of 42 produces a stock price of $294.\n\nConsidering its current position, these projections would see Amazon's stock price rise 68% by fiscal 2026. Alongside a powerful position in AI, Amazon's stock is too good to pass up right now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "3 Must-Buy Stocks for Immediate Investment Success",
        "content": "With markets hitting new highs, it’s getting harder to find must-buy stocks. Already, the market has been in a bull run since October 2022. As stocks keep on rallying, clear value opportunities are becoming rare.\n\nHowever, the market occasionally presents great opportunities. It often throws out the baby with the bath water through indiscriminate selling, presenting bargains. Overreactions or short-termism, like knee-jerk selloffs on earnings, create fertile hunting grounds for must-buy stocks.\n\nIn today’s markets, three compounders have seen a negative reaction by the market. Based on their latest price action, one would argue that their prospects have declined. However, the fundamental outlook couldn’t be better. Let’s delve deeper into their underlying numbers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to Finviz, these compounders are cashflow machines with operating margins exceeding 20%. Moreover, they will grow EPS by over 15% annually over the next five years. Yet, as of this writing, they trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) below 20.\n\nAlthough the market views these stocks unfavorably, taking a contrarian bet here will pay off. After all, these companies are market leaders in their domains. A year from now, the short-term setbacks will be in the rearview, and these stocks will be higher.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you know the shopping app Temu, then PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) should be on your radar. The Chinese e-commerce giant is Temu’s parent company. After the recent selloff from over $150 to below $130, the stock looks attractive.\n\nSo, what triggered the recent selloff? The stock fell following a report from The Information suggesting that U.S. lawmakers were pushing for an import ban on Temu. The report alleges that the shopping app could be banned in the U.S. due to the use of forced labor in its supply chain.\n\nTaking things into perspective, fears of a ban are overblown. While a ban in the U.S. is a potential risk, the likelihood is low. An outright ban on Temu seems farfetched, considering its impact on U.S.-China relations. At a time when both countries are trying to mend ties, such a move would hurt any progress.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, the company’s actions paint a picture of little worry. It is continuing its investments in the U.S. and spent heavily on Super Bowl ads. Its advertisements aired six times during the broadcast. According to the Financial Times, Temu has over 70 million users in the U.S., but only 1% of the e-commerce share compared to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) 40%. Therefore, there is a massive growth opportunity for Temu to exploit.\n\nGiven the impressive growth outlook, analysts are bullish. TipRanks analysts see over 40% upside and have a price target of $178. Thus, PDD is one of the must-buy stocks for 2024.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother long-term compounder whose stock has suffered a temporary setback is Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG). The stock fell more than 9% after reporting earnings on February 22.\n\nOverall, that was another impressive year for Booking Holdings. For the full year 2023, total gross travel bookings increased by 24% to $150.6 billion. Total revenues were $21.4 billion, representing a 25% increase from 2022. This drove a 39% increase in non-GAAP net income to $5.6 billion, with non-GAAP net income per diluted common share growing 52% to $152.22.\n\nThese solid results highlight the strength of Booking’s brands, making it one of the top must-buy stocks. It’s important to note that the company dominates the travel booking arena. Booking.com is a global leader in travel bookings, while Priceline dominates the online discount travel market. Its third platform, Agoda, is an online accommodations leader in the Asian region.\n\nKayak and OpenTable complete the list of Booking’s five key consumer brands. Altogether, Booking operates in over 220 countries and has over 28 million homes, apartments, and hotels listings. In 2023, over 1 billion room nights were booked on the platform.\n\nBased on analyst estimates, 2024 EPS will grow 15% to $174.77. Thus, BKNG stock trades at 20 times forward earnings as of this writing. That’s a bargain for a long-term compounder with operating margins above 25%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past week, Google’s parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has declined after a botched AI product launch. Gemini’s flaws left investors unimpressed, leading to a $70 billion market loss. Indeed, since the announcement, Gemini has revealed several inconsistencies and biases that CEO Sundar Pichai termed unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, Google is still a leader in AI. The company has been researching AI even before it acquired DeepMind in 2014. However, as a technology giant constantly in regulatory crosshairs, it has had to adopt a conservative approach. Although younger startups like OpenAI and Perplexity AI might be leading the charge, Google is still a major player in AI.\n\nAnother market concern has been the threat to Search from AI. Still, Google has an insurmountable lead, garnering over 90% share in the market. On that note, it’s important to remember that Google’s competitive moat in search is buttressed by its distribution advantage. Through Android, the company has Google Chrome installed on billions of devices where Google Search is the default.\n\nAs of this writing, Alphabet is one of my must-buy stocks. Other marquee assets, particularly YouTube and Google Cloud, have been impressive. In Q4 2023, Google Cloud achieved 25.6% year over year (YOY) growth. Meanwhile, YouTube revenue growth reaccelerated to 15.5% YOY, driven by growing subscription revenues.\n\nAlphabet’s AI missteps are a temporary setback that the company will resolve shortly. Furthermore, there could be more operational efficiencies as the firm addresses its bloated workforce. At 18 times forward earnings, this technology giant is a bargain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in March (and Beyond)",
        "content": "Although Wall Street has a lot of phenomenal investors, none tend to garner quite as much attention as Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. The reason for this is that Buffett's investment strategy is simple and can be duplicated by anyone. He typically seeks out brand-name businesses that offer sustainable competitive advantages and are guided by rock-solid management teams.\n\nSince taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as Buffett has come to be known, has overseen a greater-than-5,000,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on February 23. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe interesting thing about the 45 stock, $371 billion investment portfolio Buffett and his team oversee at Berkshire is that plain-as-day values can still be found -- even with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 claiming new record highs. The following three Warren Buffett stocks are all screaming buys in March, and they're fully capable of delivering for shareholders for years to come.\n\nVisa\n\nThe first Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought by opportunistic long-term-minded investors as we barrel into March is none other than world-leading payment facilitator Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nThe biggest concern for Visa shareholders is that financial stocks are cyclical. This is to say that they ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nIf the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, the expectation would be for consumer and enterprise spending to decline. That's not good news for a company like Visa that relies on growth in spending and aggregate transactions to drive its sales and profits higher.\n\nHowever, the difference between recessions and periods of growth for the U.S. economy is night and day. Even though recessions are a perfectly normal and unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, they don't stick around for very long. Out of the 12 recessions since the end of World War II in September 1945, nine failed to reach the one-year mark and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparatively, most periods of expansion last multiple years, with two surpassing the 10-year mark since World War II. Patience has been a moneymaking trait for investors in payment processors like Visa.\n\nSomething else to consider is just how vast the growth runway is that sits in front of Visa. Despite dominating credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., Visa has hardly scratched the surface in underbanked regions like the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. The company has more-than-enough capital to organically expand its payment infrastructure or can make the occasional acquisition to rapidly broaden its reach.\n\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, Visa's avoidance of lending is another reason it's such a successful business. Though I don't doubt Visa could make a seamless transition to lending, becoming a lender would expose the company to loan losses and credit delinquencies during recessions.\n\nSince it's strictly focused on payment facilitation, Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses. Not being financially constrained during periods of weakness and uncertainty helps Visa bounce back more quickly than other financial stocks from downturns, as well as keeps its profit margin north of 50%.\n\nLastly, the valuation remains enticing. Visa's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio of 25 is 13% lower than its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nA second Warren Buffett stock that represents a screaming buy in March and likely well beyond is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nFor radio operators, the health of the advertising market is often what takes precedence. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, the expectation would be for businesses to pare down their ad spending. With quite a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators suggesting a downturn in the U.S. economy in 2024, it could be a challenging year for radio operators.\n\nHowever, Sirius XM isn't a run-of-the-mill radio company. It brings three distinct competitive advantages to the table.\n\nTo start with, it's the only licensed satellite-radio operator. While it still competes for listeners with terrestrial and online-radio operators, being the only licensed satellite-radio operator provides the company with phenomenal subscription pricing power.\n\nSecondly, Sirius XM's revenue breakdown is markedly different than terrestrial and online radio providers. Whereas the latter are heavily reliant on advertising revenue to keep the lights on, Sirius XM generates only 20% of its revenue from advertising. Approximately 77% of Sirius XM's sales derive from subscriptions.\n\nSubscribers are far less likely to cancel their service than advertisers are to pull back their spending. This should allow Sirius XM to navigate inevitable downturns in the economy better than its peers.\n\nThe third competitive edge is that some aspects of its cost structure are highly predictable. While royalty and talent acquisition costs will vary from one quarter to the next, transmission and equipment costs are relatively fixed. Sirius XM can continue to add subscribers and not owe any extra expenses from these line items.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Sirius XM stock is historically cheap. Shares can be purchased right now for around 14 times Wall Street's consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the company in 2025. That's a 27% discount to Sirius XM's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year span. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe third Warren Buffett stock that's a screaming buy in March and well beyond is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nNot to sound like a broken record, but the clearest headwind for all three companies I'm highlighting is a U.S. recession. Most people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's top online marketplace. In 2023, Amazon brought in roughly $0.38 of every $1 that was spent in U.S. online retail sales. If the U.S. economy weakens, there's a pretty good chance we'd see e-commerce sales slow down or shift into reverse.\n\nBut what's critical for investors to note is that e-commerce accounts for very little of the operating income and cash flow Amazon generates. The lion's share of Amazon's profits and cash flow are derived from an assortment of ancillary segments -- and these segments are still firing on all cylinders.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon than its cloud infrastructure segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of the end of September, AWS had gobbled up close to a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, based on estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys.\n\nWith enterprise cloud spending still in its relatively early stages, AWS shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate through the remainder of the decade. Even though AWS accounts for a sixth of Amazon's net sales, it's often responsible for between 50% and 100% of the company's operating income.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are no slouches, either. Amazon is one of the most-visited sites on a monthly basis, with well over 2 billion unique visitors, which assists with its ad-pricing power. Likewise, it's signed up in excess of 200 million people worldwide to a Prime subscription.\n\nEven if the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's unlikely that Amazon's operating cash flow would suffer much, if at all. It's this robust growth in the company's cash flow that allows Amazon to aggressively reinvest in its ever-growing logistics network, as well as higher-growth initiatives, like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nTo round things out, Amazon remains inexpensive. Over the trailing-five-year period, Amazon has commanded a multiple of nearly 23 times its cash flow. However, opportunistic investors can scoop up shares of this industry leader right now for less than 13 times Wall Street's forecast cash flow for the company in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Citadel's Ken Griffin Oversees $500 Billion in Managed Assets: These Are His Top 5 Holdings",
        "content": "Three weeks ago, the most important data release of the first quarter occurred. On Feb. 14, while some people were shooting proverbial love arrows at their significant others, institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management were filing Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to see what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors have been buying, selling, and holding.\n\nDuring 13F season, it's not uncommon for investors to focus their attention on the moves made by billionaire asset managers. For instance, investors have used 13Fs to ride Warren Buffett's coattails at Berkshire Hathaway to market-trouncing returns. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut when it comes to making money, Citadel's Ken Griffin is in a class of his own. His firm's hedge fund, Citadel Advisors, closed out the December quarter with a whopping $500 billion in managed securities spread across thousands upon thousands of investments. Citadel has also generated a $74 billion net gain for its investors since its inception in 1990, which is tops among hedge funds.\n\nTo be fair, Griffin and his investment team do a lot of options hedging -- i.e., they lean on put-call spreads to hedge against their long positions. On a notional dollar basis (if the options were exercised), many of the fund's largest holdings are hedged option positions.\n\nRemoving options from the equation, we're left with five securities that Griffin and his team are betting on big-time. SPY Chart\n\n1. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust: $2.63 billion in market value (as of Dec. 31, 2023)\n\nDespite owning stakes in thousands of businesses, the largest non-derivative holding in Citadel's hedge fund is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY), which is an index fund that attempts to mirror the performance of the benchmark S&P 500. Griffin's hedge fund added more than 3.1 million shares in the fourth quarter, which brought this leading position to north of $2.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two good reasons Ken Griffin and his team have invested aggressively in this S&P 500-tracking index fund. First, bull markets historically last substantially longer than bear markets. According to a data set published last June by Bespoke Investment Group, the typical S&P 500 bull market (since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929) has stuck around for 1,011 calendar days. By comparison, the average S&P 500 bear market has resolved in just 286 calendar days.\n\nThe other reason to lean on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is that economic data hasn't produced any proverbial smoking guns signaling that the U.S. economy and stock market are in trouble. Although there are a couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators that suggest a recession in the U.S. is likely in 2024, Griffin and his investment team have little reason to alter their strategy with corporate earnings remaining strong.\n\n2. Nvidia: $1.8 billion in market value\n\nThe second-largest non-options holding in Ken Griffin's hedge fund is none other than the hottest megacap stock on the planet, semiconductor kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The more than 3.63 million shares Citadel held at the end of December works out to a $1.8 billion stake.\n\nNvidia has quickly evolved into the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become staples of high-compute data centers where split-second decision-making is needed for AI software and systems. It's possible that Nvidia's GPUs could account for a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nThe other catalyst for Nvidia is an expected ramping up of production of its high-powered GPUs. A sizable uptick in chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity from chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing should help Nvidia meet more orders this year.\n\nHowever, not everyone (i.e., me) is buying into the AI hype. Nvidia could easily cannibalize its pricing power, and it's set to face a lot of external and internal competition. To boot, U.S. regulators have clamped down on exports of its high-powered AI chips to China. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Microsoft: $1.61 billion in market value\n\nCitadel Advisors' third-biggest non-options stake in terms of market value is software and cloud titan Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Despite selling nearly 797,000 shares of Microsoft during the fourth quarter, Griffin's hedge fund still held 4.24 million shares (as of Dec. 31).\n\nThe lure of Microsoft has long been the blending of its cash-flow-rich legacy segments with its higher-growth initiatives. Though Windows and Office aren't the growth stories they once were, they're still responsible for a lot of cash flow that Microsoft has been able to repurpose in faster-growing projects.\n\nMicrosoft's bread-and-butter growth for the past couple of years has derived from its cloud services. In particular, Azure has claimed about a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spend share. Azure grew currency-neutral sales by a staggering 28% in the December-ended quarter, which is phenomenal, considering how much it's already scaled.\n\nMicrosoft is also a logical candidate to benefit from the rise of AI. It's made big investments into OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and has been incorporating AI and generative AI solutions into its search engine and cloud infrastructure service platform.\n\n4. Amazon: $945.9 million in market value\n\nThe fourth-largest position by market value in Griffin's hedge fund is leading e-commerce company Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Citadel added over 4.3 million shares during the fourth quarter, bringing its total stake to more than 6.22 million shares.\n\nAlthough Amazon is responsible for roughly 38% of U.S. online retail sales, e-commerce is a low-margin segment for the company. What likely enticed Griffin and his team of researchers to pile into Amazon stock is the company's considerably faster-growing and higher-margin ancillary operations.\n\nNo segment is more important to the future of Amazon than its cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounted for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the third quarter of 2023. Since enterprise cloud spending is still in its relatively early stages, AWS can be counted on to expand by a sustained double-digit percentage.\n\nInterestingly enough, Amazon is historically cheap, too. If the company were to meet Wall Street's consensus cash-flow target of $13.79 per share in 2025, it would be trading at a 45% discount to its average cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\n5. Advanced Micro Devices: $885.3 million in market value\n\nThe fifth-largest non-derivative holding in Ken Griffin's $500 billion hedge fund is another semiconductor powerhouse, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). Griffin and his team added north of 3.5 million shares of AMD during the fourth quarter, which brought Citadel Advisors' position to about 6 million shares.\n\nAlthough AMD has been \"chipping away\" (it would be a crime not to make this pun) at Intel's central processing unit (CPU) share in data centers and personal computers (PCs) over the past couple of years, it's the company's potential in AI-accelerated data centers that's been raising eyebrows.\n\nIn June 2023, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-driven GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's high-compute data center dominance. While the rollout of the MI300X went to only a small number of customers last year, production and delivery should ramp up in a big way in 2024. If demand for high-powered GPUs continues to outpace supply, AMD should enjoy exceptional pricing power.\n\nGriffin and his team might also be optimistic that AMD's legacy segments will pay dividends. A stabilization of the PC market, coupled with ongoing CPU share gains in data centers, PCs, and mobile, could add even more pep to AMD's skyrocketing stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "Warren Buffett may very well be the best-known investor in history. Through decades of investing success that's seen his net worth skyrocket to over $130 billion and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, become one of the world's most valuable companies, it's easy to see why.\n\nBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway's success has inspired investors to mimic some of their investments to try and replicate some of their success. While this may not be the best approach for all investors, there are some Buffett stocks that investors can feel comfortable holding onto for the long haul.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCola-Cola(NYSE: KO) is Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-largest holding, with 400 million shares. That's 6.6% of its portfolio and also amounts to a 9.3% stake in Coca-Cola.\n\nThe main allure of Coca-Cola's stock is its dividend. The company has a trailing-12-month dividend of around 3%, double the S&P 500's current yield. Beyond the above-average dividend yield, investors can appreciate Coca-Cola's commitment to yearly dividend increases. The company has increased its yearly dividend for 62 straight years and has grown over 59% in the past decade alone. KO Dividend Chart\n\nThere may be ups and downs with Coca-Cola's stock (or any stock, for that matter), but investors can count on the dividend being as reliable as it comes.\n\nAside from being the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company, Coca-Cola's longevity rests in its commitment not to get complacent with its market position. The company continues to make the necessary investments to ensure it adapts to changing consumer preferences. That's a recipe for sustained success.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock that Buffett has mentioned he was hesitant to invest in initially, but he now regrets it. Considering Amazon's stock has had generational returns in the past decade alone, it's easy to see where this regret comes from now.\n\nAmazon may be known for its e-commerce business, but it has hit the jackpot with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. E-commerce is responsible for most of Amazon's revenue, but AWS is its biggest profit-maker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Amazon's operating income was $13.2 billion, and AWS accounted for $7.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2023, Amazon's market share in the global cloud infrastructure service industry was 31%, leading second-place Microsoft Azure by 7%. E-commerce will continue to be Amazon's bread and butter, but cloud services will likely drive a lot of its growth in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market was valued at around $569 billion in 2022. It's projected to reach over $2.4 trillion in 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of around 20%. Even growing at market pace should work wonders for Amazon's financials, which already aren't too shabby. AMZN Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon is doing a good job of diversifying its business and getting a hand in many industries. Add in the recent AI boom, and the company is well-positioned to be a tech staple long-term as it strengthens its competitive advantage.\n\n3. Procter & Gamble\n\nProcter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) owns some of the best-known household brands in the world. From Tide to Pampers to Tampax to Old Spice, there's no shortage of iconic brands that P&G has under its umbrella of companies.\n\nMuch like Coca-Cola, the main appeal of P&G's stock is its dividend. It's a certified Dividend King, having increased its yearly dividend for 67 straight years and paid one for 133 years altogether. Only four companies have a longer streak of dividend increases.\n\nP&G is one of the poster children for defensive stocks. When the economy is going through a downturn, it's fairly easy for consumers to cut back on discretionary items like entertainment, electronics, or travel. It's much harder (and generally not recommended) to forego the personal health, cleaning, or hygiene products that P&G sells.\n\nBuffett likes companies with stable earnings, and that's exactly what P&G has. Its products sell regardless of the economic or market conditions, so investors tend to lean on defensive stocks when the economy is less than ideal or market volatility is high.\n\nYou probably won't see growth stock-like gains from P&G's stock, but it's a company that you can feel comfortable holding in your portfolio for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

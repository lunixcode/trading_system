        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten AI stocks that will skyrocket. If you want to skip our overview of the AI industry and all the recent developments, then you can take a look at the 5 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nIf we were to rewind the hands of time to 18 months back, not a lot of people would be hyped up about artificial intelligence. For the general public, the term would belong squarely to the realm of science fiction, and for those in the industry, AI becoming a worldwide phenomenon would appear to be a thing of the distant future.\n\nYet, with the first quarter of 2024 now over, AI is neither exclusively in the realm of science fiction and it is already a global phenomenon. The ball that started to roll with the debut of ChatGPT to the public in late 2022 and early 2024 has now sent chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by a whopping 518% since the close of 2022. At the same time, dozens of companies claiming to use large language models to help users with their daily lives are now live. They are joined by others that are selling video and image generation software for an industry whose computing needs are thought to sit in billions, if not trillions of dollars.\n\nThese computing needs are also at the center of a fundamental shakeup in the semiconductor industry. Before we get to that though, it's important to understand what AI really is. In layman's terms, AI is a set of mathematical formulae that seek to generate conclusions to queries or problems based on patterns that have been gleaned through training from an existing data set. The more voluminous and relevant this data set is, the better an AI system is, and voluminous data sets require large amounts of semiconductor chips called AI accelerators and GPUs for their processing.\n\nWhile the software end of AI is quite diverse, the hardware end can prove to be a bigger bottleneck simply due to the nature of chip fabrication. Making chips is neither cheap nor easy, and therefore, only a handful of companies in the world are capable of manufacturing high end semiconductors. In fact, only the American Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) are capable of making advanced AI chips. Out of these, only TSMC has been able to rapidly mass produce the latest chips, while Intel is catching up with its technology roadmap and Samsung fails to capture market share to stand its ground with TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis complexity and cost of manufacturing semiconductors is also why we regularly see unbelievable funding estimates for AI. In fact, the latest such bit comes from the The Information in form of a project that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI are working on. According to the details, the two plan on building a $100 billion U.S. based artificial intelligence supercomputer. The price tag is unsurprising since a single NVIDIA Blackwell GPU - one of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the world - costs between $30,000 to $40,000 according to fresh statements by NVIDIA chief Jensen Huang.\n\nSpeaking of Mr. Huang, even before the AI fever, he has advocated new technologies through which 'software will end up writing software' regularly during his technology conferences and earnings call reports. Now, with AI a permanent part of investor vocabulary, Huang's vision also appears to be coming to fruition. This is through the well known venture capitalist Peter Thiel backed startup Cognition Labs considering raising funding for a valuation of a whopping $2 billion. Cognition Labs seeks to develop an AI based tool to write code.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of AI stocks that could skyrocket, another major player in the AI race has been the Menlo Park, California based social media firm Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Before AI, Meta was one of the worst performing mega cap stocks on the market as investors remained unconvinced about its foray into the metaverse. However, it's a Wall Street AI darling now, with the shares up 129% over the past 12 months.\n\nHere's what Wedgewood Partners had to say about Meta in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nMeta Platforms was a leading contributor to performance for the quarter – and the year. Core advertising revenue growth accelerated to +23% while operating margin rebounded strongly from a year ago. The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively in deep learning recommendation systems that help power its products, which reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta Platform’s AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. For example, the Company's relatively new Reels product is just over two years old, yet it has driven a +40% increase in the time Instagram users spend on the app. Reels content and other content served up to Instagram users is often driven by several very large and expensive AI recommendation systems that must sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with a probability of a user engagement. The Company is one of the few companies that has been able to consistently and profitably monetize AI technologies for shareholders and we continue to hold it has a top position in our portfolios.\n\nSo, wondering about which AI stocks will skyrocket? We shared our #1 AI stock pick that is trading at a steep discount with our premium subscribers, but there are other investment newsletters that have different stocks in mind. In this article we will take a look at what other investment newsletters think about the best way to bet on the future of AI. 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\nA high-tech robotic drone, showcasing the company's advancements in unmanned aerial systems.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the AI stocks that will skyrocket, we ranked AI stocks covered by multiple investment newsletter websites dating back as far as November 28th, 2023 by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q4 2023.\n\nFor these AI stocks that will skyrocket, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket\n\n10. GSI Technology, Inc.

        "title": "12 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best S&P 500 stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings surrounding one of America's most widely followed stock indexes, then you can take a look at the 5 Best S&P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe S&P 500 has had a great year so far. The flagship stock index, which was quite jittery a little over a year back, has been doing well as of late. This performance comes after the tail end of 2022 which saw analysts and investors all around worried about a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates. However, 2023 came with a multitude of surprises in the form of artificial intelligence, falling inflation, and a growing economy - all of which ended up putting the bears to rest.\n\nSo how great has the first quarter of 2024 been for the S&P 500? Well, for starters, the index has set a new record this year. In fact, while the index has been regularly setting records in 2024, its latest record came just before the Easter holiday long weekend. This saw the S&P 500 set a new closing record of 5,245 - ensuring that the index comfortably remains above the coveted benchmark of 5,000 points that most folks would have thought was impossible at the close of 2022 and in an era marked by 'expensive' and difficult to get cash due to high interest rates.\n\nThe next question to ask is, why is the S&P 500 setting new records? After all, despite the ongoing euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence, the close of Q1 2024 has also seen investors re calibrate their expectations for the Federal Reserve potentially reducing the bank rate. These expectations have shifted for the worse, with most folks now expecting the rate cuts to start later than originally expected.\n\nWell, several macroeconomic data points have led to the S&P setting new records. For instance, investors were dealt with a nice surprise in the form of an upward GDP growth revision for Q4 2023 which saw the new estimate grow to sit at 3.4% from an earlier 3.2%. Additionally, even though the commercial real estate sector continues to feel the pinch from a massive shakeup in the bond market and the interest rate environment, home sales in America grew by 1.6% in February to outpace estimates of a 1.5% growth. Another data point that is yet to be reflected in the S&P 500 is the Fed's preferred inflation indication, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest data shows that as of February 2024, inflation in the U.S. stood at 2.5% - meeting forecasts and being more in tune with the Fed's preferred 2% reading.\n\nStory continues\n\nDigging deeper, some of the stocks that have fueled the S&P 500's 11% year to date gains are Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and of course, Wall Street's A.I. darling, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The three stocks are up 254%, 60%, and 88% year to date, and the fact that two out of three of the S&P 500's best performing stocks in the first quarter of 2024 are technology companies shows how artificial intelligence has fundamentally shifted stock market valuations. While everyone knows that it's NVIDIA's high end GPUs that have injected steroids into its share price, for Super Micro and Constellation Energy, the catalysts were a second quarter earnings beat and guidance raise for the former and a 2024 forecast beat for the latter.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, while the retail camp is often left reacting to the news, hedge funds spend countless hours and vast sums of money picking out the right set of stocks. As the first quarter of 2024 comes to a close, let's see what the hedge funds were saying about NVIDIA in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAn excerpt from Polen Capital's investor letter for the period is as follows:\n\nNVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA’s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).\n\nGiven many of NVIDIA’s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn’t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peak.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at which S&P 500 stocks analysts can't stop talking about. A couple of notable picks are Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nA customer using a mobile banking app at home to securely transfer money.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the S&P 500 stocks to buy according to analysts, we ranked the stocks in the index by the average share price target percentage upside and picked out the top stocks.\n\nFor these top S&P 500 stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best S&P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\n12.

The investment was one of five that Nvidia made in tech companies related to artificial intelligence (AI) in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSo what exactly does SoundHound AI do, and should investors follow in Nvidia's footsteps and invest in the stock?\n\nCarving a niche in voice AI\n\nBefore Nvidia's investment in the company came to light, SoundHound AI was not exactly well-known. However, the company has relationships with a number of large automobile companies that use its technology to help power their voice assistant technologies. The company's platform is incorporated into devices, such as automobiles, and its AI technology helps voice assistants interact with users in a more natural and conversational manner.\n\nSoundHound AI's platform, which it calls Houndify, achieves this in two primary ways. First, it uses speech-to-meaning technology, which processes speech in real-time so the device understands its meaning even before the user is done talking. Next, it uses deep-meaning-understanding technology to help understand a user's intent and answer complex questions.\n\nAn example of its technology at work would be a voice assistant that is able to give hotel recommendations when given a list of variables, such as location, price ranges, amenities, and star ratings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMaking progress in the automobile and quick-service restaurant verticals\n\nThe area in which SoundHound AI has made the most progress selling into is the automotive industry. The company has relationships with over 20 auto brands, including Honda, Jeep, Hyundai, Fiat, Chrysler, and RAM, among others. In conjunction with its fourth-quarter earnings report, it said it won a deal with a prominent U.S.-based EV maker and signed another contract with a large automaker to significantly increase its unit volumes through 2037.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also been making big strides in the quick-service restaurant vertical. Its SoundHound for Restaurants voice assistant will take phone orders so employees don't have to answer calls and can instead focus on helping customers. It also has solutions for drive-thrus and kiosks.\n\nThe company has signed deals with restaurant-focused fintech companies such as Toast and Olo, as well as quick-service chains such as White Castle and Jersey Mike's, among others.\n\nSoundHound AI's strength in the automobile and restaurant verticals helped it grow its revenue by 47% in 2023 to $45.9 million. Meanwhile, for 2024, it forecast revenue of between $63 million and $77 million, which is nearly 53% growth at the midpoint. It said it was looking for revenue to exceed $100 million in 2025.\n\nWhile that is solid growth, SoundHound AI's cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million is more interesting. This metric represents the potential revenue the company expects to generate over the duration of its signed contracts. Currently, the average duration of its contracted backlog is six and a half years, so much of the revenue from these contracts should be recognized before the end of 2031, although some contracts extend out longer.\n\nA speculative investment\n\nIt's easy to see why Nvidia likes SoundHound, with the company growing quickly and having a large revenue backlog. It also isn't difficult to imagine that SoundHound AI's technology can be applied to other industries as well, which could accelerate its growth.\n\nThe two companies also recently announced a collaboration where SoundHound AI will offer on-chip voice AI that doesn't need internet connectivity using Nvidia's DRIVE platform. The solution will allow users to access SoundHound AI's Vehicle Intelligence offering, where users can ask auto-specific questions, such as what it means when a dash light is on, as well as general questions, such as finding the best place to eat nearby. SOUN PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThat said, with SoundHound stock trading at an over 26x price-to-sales ratio and the company currently unprofitable, the stock is very speculative at this point. Its technology looks impressive, but AI technology is evolving quickly. What could seem like cutting-edge technology today could become commoditized in the future. While its cumulative backlog is impressive, that only equates to about $100 million a year in revenue over the average duration of its contracts, so the company has a long way to grow into its current valuation.\n\nAs such, I recommend that investors keep their positions small if they want to follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock, as they should with Nvidia itself.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Will Make You Richer in 2024",
        "content": "It's almost the end of the first quarter of the calendar year, and the good news for investors is that the S&P 500 index has delivered steady gains of 9% in 2024. More importantly, the stock market seems set for more upside as the year progresses thanks to strong earnings performances from major names in the index.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts have been quickly raising their forecasts about where the S&P 500 could be at the end of the year. Bank of America now expects the S&P 500 to hit 5,400 by the end of 2024 as compared to its earlier forecast of 5,000. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast to 5,200 last month from 4,700 in December, but it looks like the investment bank will have to further raise its expectations as the index is already past that mark.\n\nThis broader stock market rally is going to be a big tailwind for the likes of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), and Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU). All three companies are benefiting from a major catalyst that could help them maintain impressive levels of growth in 2024 and beyond.\n\nLet's look at the reasons all three stocks are likely to head higher as the year progresses.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia stock has delivered impressive gains of 87% in 2024 as of this writing. And it still has the potential to deliver more gains this year thanks to its aggressive product road map that should allow it to maintain its dominance in the lucrative artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nNvidia estimates that data centers are on track to spend $250 billion this year on accelerated computing chips like the graphics processing units (GPUs) that the company sells.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang says this addressable revenue opportunity in data centers is growing at an annual pace of 25%. Nvidia sold $47.5 billion worth of data center chips in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year).\n\nIts revenue from this segment more than tripled year over year in fiscal 2024. And the massive revenue opportunity that Huang sees means that the company's data center business still has a lot of room for growth, especially considering that it reportedly has a near monopoly in the AI chip market with an estimated market share of 95%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs later this year could help Nvidia maintain its tight grip over this market. The upcoming chips are four times faster than the current-generation Hopper chips for AI training, and they are said to be 30 times faster in AI inference workloads.\n\nThe new graphics cards are reportedly going to be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which would be a bump from the $20,000 to $30,000 price range of the current H100 graphics cards. Given that these new chips reportedly cost $6,000 to manufacture, Nvidia is likely to make a solid profit on its next-generation AI chips.\n\nAll this explains why 10 analysts have raised their earnings estimate for the current fiscal year in the past month. The company is expected to finish the year with $22.73 per share in earnings as compared to $12.96 last year.\n\nAs a result, there is a strong probability of Nvidia stock heading higher in 2024 thanks to its improved pricing power, which is why it would be a good idea to buy this AI stock right now at 35 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average of 39.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk stock is up 21% this year, and there is a good chance it could end 2024 with much stronger gains. The company's growth is accelerating due to higher spending on digital advertising as well as the increasing adoption of its programmatic advertising platform.\n\nThere is robust demand for The Trade Desk's AI-enabled cloud-based platform because it allows marketers to purchase ad inventory, create campaigns, and optimize them using real-time data to drive stronger returns on the ad dollars spent. That led to a 23% year-over-year increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $606 million.\n\nThe Trade Desk's guidance of $478 million in revenue for the current quarter means that its top line is on track to jump 25% compared to the year-ago period. That would be an improvement over the growth it delivered in the previous quarter.\n\nIt is not surprising to see why The Trade Desk is witnessing an acceleration in growth. According to the analytical firm eMarketer, programmatic ad spending is expected to grow at three times the pace of nonprogrammatic spending. More specifically, the firm expects programmatic ad spending in the U.S. to increase by almost 16% in 2024, up from 11.4% last year.\n\nThe reason behind the faster growth in programmatic ad spending is that this method of advertising automates the media buying process with the help of real-time data. Advertisers can bid for ad inventory in real time to keep their costs low and display their ads across different channels depending on where they can improve audience targeting.\n\nThe Trade Desk, therefore, could end 2024 with stronger revenue growth as compared to the 23% top-line jump it delivered last year to $1.95 billion. Investors looking for a growth stock would do well to buy its shares right now because it seems built for more upside in 2024.\n\n3. Micron Technology\n\nShares of Micron Technology have jumped 39% this year, and the company's latest results suggest that its bull run is just getting started. The memory specialist crushed Wall Street's expectations in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Feb. 29) with $5.8 billion in revenue and $0.42 per share in adjusted earnings.\n\nConsensus estimates were projecting a loss of $0.25 per share on $5.35 billion in revenue. Micron, however, posted a surprise profit as its top line jumped 58% year over year.\n\nAnd the $6.6 billion revenue estimate for the current quarter indicates that its top line is on track to increase at a faster pace of 76% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe massive increases in the chipmaker's top and bottom lines stem from the improvement in the memory-chip market's dynamics. According to Micron, \"the supply-demand balance tightened\" in the memory industry last quarter, driven by strong demand from AI servers and improving conditions in the personal computer (PC) and smartphone markets.\n\nAnd supply reductions by memory manufacturers should ensure that Micron continues to take advantage of a strong pricing environment.\n\nIn all, the memory industry is expected to generate nearly $130 billion in revenue in 2024, up 45% from last year, according to Statista.\n\nAs a result, analysts are forecasting a 56% increase in Micron's revenue this year to $24 billion, followed by another jump of 43% in fiscal 2025 to $34.5 billion. This tremendous revenue growth should also translate into stronger earnings power, which is why it would be a good idea to buy shares before they soar higher following its post-earnings pop.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "You don't buy growth stocks primarily to receive income. Many of these stocks don't pay dividends at all. However, that doesn't mean you can't earn dividend income from growth stocks.\n\nThe biggest growth stocks on the planet right now are the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Can you count on sitting back and having dividends pour in with these stocks? Yes -- at least with some of them. Here's how much dividend income you'd make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nA dividend divide\n\nThere's a clear \"dividend divide\" among the Magnificent Seven stocks. Although they all arguably make enough money to pay dividends, only four actually do so.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) initiated its dividend program in 2003. Since then, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) technically began paying quarterly dividends decades ago. However, the company ended its dividend program in 1995 and didn't resume distributing dividends until 2012. Like Microsoft, Apple has consistently increased its dividend payout.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is perhaps the most surprising dividend stock in the Magnificent Seven. The big chipmaker first declared a quarterly dividend in 2012. Nvidia increased its dividend regularly for several years but has maintained a steady payout since late 2019.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the newest Magnificent Seven dividend payer. The social media company initiated its dividend program earlier in 2024.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Tesla don't currently offer dividends. That could change in the future for two of the three, though. Goldman Sachs analysts predict that Amazon and Alphabet could begin paying dividends, perhaps as soon as this year.\n\nCounting the money\n\nSo how much dividend income could you make by investing $70,000 in the Magnificent Seven stocks? If you bought $10,000 of each stock, the total would be just under $170. The following table breaks down how much in dividends each stock would contribute:\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $71.00 Apple 0.56% $56.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $41.00 Nvidia 0.018% $1.80 Amazon N/A $0.00 Alphabet N/A $0.00 Tesla N/A $0.00 Total $169.80\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nOf course, if you were truly seeking dividend income you probably wouldn't buy shares of Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. Let's crunch the numbers assuming you invested $70,000 split equally across the four dividend payers in the Magnificent Seven ($17,500 in each stock). The following table shows how much you'd make:\n\nStock Dividend Yield Annual Dividend Income Microsoft 0.71% $124.25 Apple 0.56% $98.00 Meta Platforms 0.41% $71.75 Nvidia 0.018% $3.15 Total $297.15\n\nData source: Google Finance. Calculations by author. N/A = Not Applicable.\n\nWould most income investors be happy with an annual dividend income of less than $300 from an initial investment of $70,000? Probably not.\n\nLimited magnificence\n\nThe magnificence of the Magnificent Seven stocks is limited. None of them offer attractive dividends. The best dividend payer in the group, Microsoft, still has a dividend yield of barely over half of the yield of the S&P 500.\n\nDividends are an afterthought if you're investing in the Magnificent Seven. Buy these stocks for their growth prospects. Many other stocks are more magnificent if you want solid dividend income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "From Silicon to Software: A Quick and Easy Guide to AI Investing This Spring",
        "content": "Welcome to the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, where transforming the mundane into the extraordinary is just another day at the office. Three Motley Fool contributors, each with a keen eye on the AI landscape, put their heads together to share their best AI investment recommendations as March rolls over into April.\n\nIt's quite the lineup. UiPath(NYSE: PATH) makes the routine remarkable. Chips from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are training your favorite AI platforms right now. And Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is crafting the world's AI infrastructure, one networking chip at a time.\n\nHow UiPath stands out in the AI market\n\nAnders Bylund (UiPath): Business automation expert UiPath's place in the world is quite simple. By automating the simple, mundane, and repetitive tasks in a company's daily operations, employees can focus their efforts on innovative and value-added functions instead.\n\nAfter applying UiPath's AI-driven bots to their daily grind of uninspiring jobs, clients tend to save costs and speed up basic processes. With a newfound freedom to pursue more-fulfilling projects, their employees become happier and more effective.\n\nSo it's no surprise to see UiPath's business booming in the ongoing AI boom. Sales rose 31% year over year in the recently published fourth-quarter report. Free cash flows were essentially break-even in the 2023 fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, 2023, just a few weeks after OpenAI's ChatGPT introduction. One year later, for the 2024 fiscal year, UiPath had collected $309 million of free cash flow on $1.3 billion in top-line revenue. In other words, the public frenzy for AI tools boosted the company's cash-based profit margin from zero to 24% in just one year.\n\nThis should be the start of a sustained growth spurt. AI tools are an easy sale right now, and the company enjoys strong word-of-mouth marketing when new customers walk away happier and richer. PATH Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nBut nobody has spread the word across Wall Street yet. UiPath trades at 10 times sales and 34 times forward earnings estimates. These ratios would be appropriate for a moderately growing retailer or basic-materials producer. For a high-margin software expert with skyrocketing sales, they look like a bargain.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo if you're looking for a modestly priced AI stock with a generous shot of nitro in its sales-growth engines, UiPath deserves a second look. This bargain is hard to beat, even if you pointed UiPath's own automation tools at the problem. Cathie Wood is buying the stock hand over fist these days, and you should consider following her lead.\n\nBroadcom: Now much more than just another chip supplier\n\nBilly Duberstein(Broadcom): Even though it's had a massive run, Broadcom might still be underrated as an AI juggernaut.\n\nThe stock trades at 28 times this year's earnings estimates, but the company has been a regular beater of analyst estimates, so it's a pretty good bet that Broadcom beats earnings estimates this year as well. That's especially true because its two AI chip divisions seem poised for strong growth.\n\nBroadcom's first AI chip segment involves merchant-networking chips, where Broadcom leads in ethernet communications through its Tomahawk switching chips, Jericho routing chips, as well as optical transceiver chips that all work together in enabling lightning-fast communications.\n\nThe second AI division makes custom ASIC chips that combine with customers' IP to form custom AI accelerators for specific uses. For instance, Alphabet uses Broadcom's IP in its custom Tensor Processing Units, and Meta Platforms is a second key customer. These two mega-clients each bring in lots of money for Broadcom, especially over the past year as AI applications have taken off.\n\nRecently, Broadcom increased its outlook for AI chip sales growth in 2024, forecasting AI revenue to reach 35% of its semiconductor revenue this year while amounting to over $10 billion in total. That's up from a 25% proportion that it had forecast in its prior quarter.\n\nNot only that, but since the earnings release, Broadcom announced a third ASIC customer, which is no doubt a large tech company set to grow a lot in the coming years. So its AI revenue could even exceed what management had forecast on its recent earnings report.\n\nYet while the AI chip segment is booming, Broadcom also disclosed exciting news regarding its software segment, which has grown substantially with the acquisition of VMware last November.\n\nWith that acquisition, software makes up nearly half of Broadcom's revenue. But it also appears the VMware business could be inflecting on a stand-alone basis -- conveniently for shareholders, just after Broadcom closed the purchase. On a recent conference call with analysts, CEO Hock Tan said he sees VMware growing by double digits sequentially each quarter through this year.\n\nThat would be a serious acceleration relative to VMware's pre-acquisition growth, reflecting increased pricing for the new VMware Cloud Foundation product. This premium product is an integrated software stack that virtualizes all aspects of a customer's computing, storage, networking, and even AI GPUs in their on-premise data centers. Hardware virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of physical desktops and operating systems -- its benefits include better performance and lower costs.\n\nIn a new AI world, it's likely that corporate customers will operate between on-premise data centers and public clouds, depending on the capabilities of each. And it's also likely that companies will want to use cloud-based AI tools but will also be wary of sharing their data outside their own on-premises data centers. In that world, VMware should be even more valuable as the connective tissue between all these computing environments.\n\nBut perhaps the larger point is that Broadcom is now more than just a chipmaker. As the only tech platform with a roughly 50/50 split between chips and software, it can now look in both the hardware and software world for future acquisitions. Given that the company's business model is centered around acquisitions, investors might not realize how much its growth prospects have increased with the VMware buy.\n\nAs such, despite being up 116% over the past year, Broadcom stock looks like it might still be underrated relative to other AI darlings.\n\nAre we closer to peak Nvidia than investors believe?\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Nvidia): Nvidia has had meteoric rises in the past, but this one from the last two years takes the cake. As the superpower responsible for kicking off the AI race, Nvidia's name (rooted in the Latin \"invidia\" for envy, the feeling the co-founders, including CEO Jensen Huang, wanted to inspire among competitors) has become a self-fulfilled prophecy as the semiconductor industry and tech sector at large have fallen into the company's orbit.\n\nOf course, we're far away from Nvidia leading the field in graphics processing alone. The company's GPUs have become the backbone of new generative-AI training, and for a lot of AI inference, too (once the AI system has been trained and is put to use).\n\nHuang recently said that his company is at the forefront of two giant markets. The first is the massive task of upgrading the world's existing data center fleet to accelerated computing hardware. And the second is the new generative-AI market that needs brand-new purpose-built data centers.\n\nThe generative-AI market, geared especially toward AI training, is already dominated by Nvidia. Its total value is yet unknown, but could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars in total data-center assets within the next few years.\n\nThe existing global data-center market is currently valued at $1 trillion. The hardware within this massive computing footprint tends to get upgraded every four to five years. And right now, the upgrades needed are accelerated computing -- precisely the type of chips that Nvidia has become synonymous with.\n\nPaired with the new generative-AI infrastructure being installed, this existing data-center upgrade cycle is why one of Nvidia's chief rivals, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), has said total sales of accelerated-computing chips could reach $400 billion in 2027.\n\nGiven Nvidia's absolute dominance up to this point, this gargantuan opportunity is why the company now fetches an absurd-looking $2.3 trillion market cap -- or 37 times current-year expected earnings per share. This ranks Nvidia as one of the world's most highly valued companies (one of the \"Magnificent Seven\"), even though its actual revenue and profit are still far behind that of the largest businesses. Investors believe Nvidia will remain in high-growth mode for quite some time.\n\nAnd grow it will. Management provided early guidance that assumes another year of massive growth in 2024. For reference, the consensus from Wall Street analysts is now at least 80% revenue expansion this year, with profit margins remaining near all-time highs.\n\nGiven these assumptions, investors who don't already own Nvidia should tread cautiously. Its business is cyclical, and at some point, the AI-infrastructure construction frenzy will moderate and go through a cyclical decline. But are we close to peak Nvidia sales? It certainly doesn't look like it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market will have a significant impact on economic productivity and growth. It is a ripe field to find long-term winners, but as with any new technology, there will be winners and losers. A simple criteria to stack the odds in your favor is to invest in AI leaders that are turning a profit and generating loads of free cash flow from operations.\n\nTwo that come top to mind are AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). There are probably no other companies spending more on AI technology than these two. Their current valuations seem cheap relative to their growth and could deliver spectacular returns over the next decade.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares of Nvidia have soared 254% over the last year, as its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for AI-based applications. The company's dominance in the AI chip market has other companies vying for a piece of the pie. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are launching new chips they hope will compete with Nvidia, but it's easier said than done.\n\nNvidia is not just a GPU company. It also provides software, systems, and algorithms that create a platform of services for data scientists and AI researchers. This is why it earns sky-high margins, converting $0.49 of every dollar of revenue into a profit. Nvidia's free cash flow swelled to $27 billion last quarter on a trailing-12-month basis, which provides ample ammunition to invest in more innovation.\n\nSome investors are skeptical how long Nvidia's reign will last. This is why the stock trades at a relatively low valuation. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38 is quite low for a company growing earnings at triple-digit rates.\n\nBut Nvidia's run is far from over. It's set to begin shipping the new H200 GPU later this year, which offers a leap in AI performance over the H100 that is fueling the company's growth right now. Plus, management is seeing growing interest from governments around the world that want to invest in AI to build large language models using their own languages. This could significantly extend Nvidia's growth runway.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Nvidia has everything you could want in an AI investment. It is enormously profitable, dominates the GPU market, and the stock is reasonably valued relative to its future prospects.\n\n2. Alphabet (Google)\n\nShares of Alphabet are up 47% over the last 12 months, beating the return of the S&P 500 index. The company's investments in AI for Google Search and its digital ad business are great reasons to consider holding the stock.\n\nGoogle is the leader in the digital ad market, but it is facing competition from Microsoft's Bing. Google Search has seen its market share decline in recent years, which could pressure growth in Alphabet's advertising revenue. This is why the stock is conservatively valued at a forward P/E of 22, which is lower than the average stock.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has strengths in data and AI that are underestimated. With billions of users across YouTube and Google, the company has loads of user data to make its AI models smarter, and it's got the resources to keep investing.\n\nIt is investing billions in new servers and data centers while growing its free cash flow to $69 billion in 2023. Alphabet plans to significantly increase spending in 2024 to prepare for growth opportunities in offering more AI applications for individual users, advertisers, developers, governments, and cloud enterprise customers.\n\nSpeaking of the cloud, AI will have a major impact on the growth of Google Cloud -- one of the largest cloud service providers for enterprise. Alphabet's cloud revenue grew 26% year over year in the fourth quarter, and the segment is starting to turn a profit, which could benefit the stock.\n\nAlphabet has tremendous financial fortitude, making it a relatively safe AI stock. It's a solid choice that can serve as a core holding in a well-diversified investment portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 25, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to rocket higher in the first three months of 2024, fueled in part by the continued outperformance of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThe seven monster stocks accounted for practically all of the S&P 500's positive performance in the first half of 2023 and have continued to move higher as a group since then. Not every member of the group has beat the market in 2024, but those that have -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms -- have significantly outperformed. Apple and Tesla are the only members that have meaningfully lagged the broader index.\n\nWhile the performance of the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023 has been spectacular, every good investor knows past performance is not indicative of future results. Investors should be determining whether today's stock price justifies the potential future returns from the business. That's where one of the Magnificent Seven looks particularly appealing, and another member seems overpriced.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist right now\n\nWithin this elite stock group, the most attractively priced for long-term investors is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Alphabet is the company behind Google, which took a 92% share of the global online search market last month. That kind of reach is enviable for just about any ad-supported internet service, but Google can turn the dial a little more with its ancillary services. It counts nine separate products with over 1 billion users. That gives it a ton of data on its user base, which it can use to tailor its ad products and boost its prices relative to other companies.\n\nAmong those nine products with over 1 billion users is its Android operating system. The mobile OS holds a dominant global market share while still supporting nearly half of all smartphones in the U.S., where Apple's iPhone is exceptionally popular. Owning the mobile platform for the majority of smartphones in use around the world cements Google's position in search on mobile, despite regulatory challenges against its arrangement with Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's strong position in search resulted in 11% ad revenue growth in 2023. But Alphabet has several other growth drivers. Its public cloud computing service, Google Cloud, is growing quickly, up 26% last year. What's more, Alphabet's Other Bets segment includes several promising companies, including Waymo, its autonomous vehicle company. If any of these moonshots pay off, it could result in a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Alphabet and its investors.\n\nAlphabet is well-positioned for consistent revenue and profit growth for years to come. Meanwhile, the stock trades for a forward P/E ratio of 22.4. That's a slight premium to the S&P 500, but still inexpensive relative to its other high-flying peers in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWith consistent revenue growth and margin expansion, plus the potential for a moonshot to payoff, Alphabet looks like the best stock to buy among the tech giants.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague\n\nIf there's one stock among the \"Magnificent Seven\" I can't get on board with, it's Nvidia. Despite the strong performance of the company, the stock price seems to have gotten well ahead of the actual results. What's more, the outlook for the business doesn't look as strong as its recent past.\n\nNvidia's results have been driven by its data center business for the last few years, which mostly stems from the boom in artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs). Nvidia's graphics processing units are well-suited for training LLMs. Its chips are more performant and power-efficient than anyone else's off-the-rack solution, and it's managed to maintain that lead over competitors for a long time now. As a result, data center revenue grew from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in 2023 to $47.5 billion in 2024.\n\nNot only has Nvidia's revenue skyrocketed, but its margins expanded too. Gross margin expanded from 63% in the fourth quarter last year to 76% this year. Likewise, it exhibited incredible operating leverage over the past year, as operating expenses barely budged relative to its revenue.\n\nBut there's an important factor that's driven those results: supply constraints. Those supply constraints could be alleviated by the end of 2024, according to Nvidia's manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. At that point, gross margin will come down, and Nvidia will have to sell more chips to maintain revenue growth.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors are coming to market with viable alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs. Not only that, but some of its biggest customers, the big tech companies in the Magnificent Seven, have designed their own chips for training their LLMs. On top of that, demand should shift from the GPUs needed to train LLMs to chips needed for running AI applications on devices. As a result, the demand for Nvidia's chips may not sustain its current level.\n\nIt doesn't take an advanced economics degree to understand that growing supply and falling demand means prices will come down. While Nvidia can certainly do well despite the pressure, its stock is priced like companies will continue to pay top dollar for as many chips as Nvidia can produce.\n\nShares currently trade around 39 times forward earnings. But with profit margin under pressure as supply-demand levels normalize, it'll be hard for Nvidia to keep growing earnings at a level that can make that high multiple worth it for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Allow Nvidia to Crush Apple and Microsoft, and Become the Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the hottest player in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most important hardware element of the servers that run advanced AI applications.\n\nIn the particularly high-margin category of GPUs tailored to run AI and other accelerated computing applications, Nvidia currently commands roughly 90% of the market. While competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are making moves to ramp up their capabilities in the ultra-high-performance GPU space, many analysts expect Nvidia to retain its incredible strength in the category.\n\nWith incredible performances behind it and management guiding for further explosive growth, Nvidia stock has risen by 240% over the last year and is up 82% so far in 2024.\n\nThese gains have pushed Nvidia's market cap to roughly $2.27 trillion. It now ranks as the world's third-most valuable company and the third-most valuable member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Apple, currently sitting in second place, has a market cap of $2.65 trillion, while top dog Microsoft is valued at approximately $3.12 trillion.\n\nCould Nvidia soon be the world's most valuable company?\n\nAI's most influential player is reaping the rewards\n\nStarting late in 2022, incredible leaps forward in artificial intelligence technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. That progress ramped up dramatically in 2023, and it has shown no sign of slowing down this year.\n\nAs businesses and institutions have made moves to gain exposure to the AI space, demand has soared for Nvidia's most advanced processors. Its sales and earnings have shot through the roof.\n\nIn last year's fourth quarter, the company's sales grew 265% year over year to $22.16 billion. Thanks to dramatic performance acceleration in 2023's second half, Nvidia's annual sales increased by 126% to $60.9 billion. NVDA Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nNvidia posted $29.76 billion in net income last year -- equal to 49% of its total sales. That's an incredible net income margin for a hardware-oriented business; those often have lower margins compared to software-oriented businesses due to the higher incremental costs associated with producing physical goods.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the company's incredible margins reflect just how highly in demand its GPUs are right now. It's reasonable to expect that Nvidia's incredible growth will moderate, but the business looks poised to grow at a much faster rate than Apple and Microsoft for the next few years at least. AAPL Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nApple and Microsoft still generate far more revenue and net income than Nvidia. On the other hand, the chip powerhouse looks well positioned to continue being the biggest winner in the AI revolution, and has been growing at a far faster rate than those larger tech giants.\n\nFor comparison, Microsoft  grew its sales roughly by 10% over the trailing-12-month period and increased its net income by 20%. Meanwhile, Apple's revenue was flat across that stretch, though its net income rose by 7%.\n\nIf demand for AI services continues to rise dramatically, there's a good chance that Nvidia will surpass Apple's market cap and take the title of world's most valuable company from Microsoft within the next five years. While the GPU leader's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, it still appears to be in the early stages of benefiting from the unfolding AI revolution.\n\nRight now, Nvidia is benefiting from the emergence of an unprecedented new technology -- and that means forecasting its performance over the next five years involves a heavy dose of speculation. But given its incredible sales and earnings momentum and the overall market excitement for artificial intelligence applications, it wouldn't be shocking to see Nvidia claim the title of world's most valuable business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 82.5% in the first quarter of 2024. (The market's quarter ended on Thursday, as U.S. financial markets were closed on Friday for the Good Friday holiday.) That performance made the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader the second-best performer on the S&P 500 index, behind only Super Micro Computer, a server specialist that's also benefiting from strong demand for AI products and services.\n\nFor context, in the first quarter, the S&P 500 gained 10.2%, and notched an all-time closing high on Thursday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 9.1%.\n\nNvidia stock's top catalyst: AI, particularly generative AI\n\nThe main catalyst behind Nvidia stock's amazing performance so far in 2024 can be stated in two words: artificial intelligence. More specifically, it's generative AI, which has significantly expanded the potential applications of AI. This tech enables users to quickly generate new content of various types based on a variety of input categories, such as images and sounds.\n\nGenerative AI captivated the tech world in November 2022 when OpenAI broadly released ChatGPT. This chatbot's popularity skyrocketed, leading to a frenzy among companies and other entities to obtain generative AI capabilities.\n\nNvidia's data center: Its primary platform beneficiary of robust demand for AI capabilities\n\nNvidia's data center platform is its primary beneficiary of the strong demand among entities of all types to acquire generative AI capabilities. The data center is Nvidia's largest platform, accounting for 83% of its total revenue in its quarter ended Jan. 28. This business has been growing like gangbusters, as will be quantified below.\n\nNvidia's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) accelerate the processing of AI and high-performance computing workloads. The company's current flagship data center GPU is the H100, and its next Hopper architecture-based GPU, H200, is scheduled to begin shipping in the second quarter of this year. Its data center GPUs based on its next-generation architecture, Blackwell, promise a huge leap in performance and are expected to launch later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia stock entered 2024 with momentum\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia stock rocketed 239%, earning it the No. 2 spot among the S&P 500 index's top performers. (Super Micro Computer was the best performer with a 246% gain.) For context, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite returned 26.3% and 44.6%, respectively, last year.\n\nNvidia stock's momentum at the end of 2023 and through late February 2024 was driven by the company's release of blockbuster quarterly results on Nov. 23, 2023. In its third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 206% and 593%, respectively, year over year. Growth was powered by the data center platform's revenue soaring 279% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn 2024 through Feb. 21 (when the company released its next round of quarterly results), Nvidia stock gained 36.2%.\n\nNvidia stock got a boost from the Feb. 21 quarterly earnings release\n\nOn Feb. 21, Nvidia released its report for its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Jan. 28). It was another blockbuster report, fueled by the data center platform's phenomenal AI-driven growth.\n\nFor the quarter ended Jan. 28, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS rocketed 265% and 486%, respectively, year over year. Both results easily beat Wall Street's estimates. Growth was driven by the data center platform's 409% revenue surge. The gaming and professional visualization platforms also performed well, with their year-over-year revenue jumping 56% and 105%, respectively.\n\nInvestors propelled shares up 16.4% on the day following the earnings release, and the stock continued to move upward through the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNvidia is poised for further phenomenal growth\n\nNvidia is poised to turn in another fantastic quarterly report. For the period ending in late April, management guided for revenue to grow 234% and adjusted EPS to increase 396% year over year.\n\nThe AI revolution is in the early stages, so Nvidia has a potentially very long runway for growth.

        "title": "Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Is Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock",
        "content": "Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could soon face a reckoning. In March, she wrote:\n\nWithout an explosion in software revenue to justify the overbuilding of GPU capacity, we would not be surprised to see a pause in spending, compounding a correction in excess inventories, particularly among the cloud customers that account for more than half of Nvidia's data center sales.\n\nThat does not necessarily mean Nvidia is a bad investment. The company has navigated supply gluts in the past, and the stock has always rebounded. But Ark Invest sees better opportunities elsewhere. So Wood and her team continued to sell shares of Nvidia throughout March, while redeploying capital in The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD), another company that stands to benefit from artificial intelligence.\n\nHere's what investors should know about the ad tech company.\n\nThe Trade Desk is the leading independent platform for media buyers\n\nThe Trade Desk operates the largest independent, demand-side platform, a type of ad tech software that helps media buyers plan, measure, and optimize data-driven campaigns across digital channels. Its platform features what management sees as industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) and measurement capabilities, both of which help media buyers realize greater returns on ad spending.\n\nThe Trade Desk has a particularly strong presence in connected TV (CTV) and retail media, two of the fastest-growing advertising channels. In fact, Forrester Research recently said The Trade Desk dominates the CTV advertising space, and Morgan Stanley believes the company will \"ultimately be a leader in offsite retail-media advertising\" due to its independent business model and growing list of retail partners.\n\nTo elaborate, the term independent means The Trade Desk is not affiliated with any websites or mobile apps, so it has no reason to steer advertisers toward specific inventory. By comparison, Alphabet's Google has constructed an advertising ecosystem rife with conflicts of interest. It sells ad tech software to third-party media buyers and publishers, while simultaneously selling its own inventory from properties like Google Search and YouTube.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat means Google has a clear incentive to direct ad buyers toward specific inventory, and the company also competes against its own customers. The upshot of those conflicts is that brands are more willing to share data with an independent player like The Trade Desk. The company has used that advantage to embed its platform with robust AI and measurement capabilities.\n\nSpecifically, The Trade Desk sources data from numerous leading retailers to create measurement opportunities not available on other platforms. Its lineup of partners includes Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, and Albertsons, all of which rank among the ten largest retailers in the world. The unique data sourced from those retailers also lays the foundation for superior AI, simply because data is a limiting factor in training machine learning models.\n\nThe Trade Desk gained market share in the fourth quarter\n\nThe Trade Desk reported strong results in the fourth quarter. Customer retention remained over 95% for the tenth consecutive year, revenue rose 23% to $606 million, and net income according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) increased 36% to $0.19 per diluted share. CEO Jeff Green told analysts, \"We outperformed the rest of the digital advertising space for the last eight quarters.\" He also said the company was uniquely positioned to continue gaining share not just in 2024, but also well into the future.\n\nThe Trade Desk launched a new platform called Kokai last June. It features a more advanced AI engine that synthesizes signals across 13 million impressions per second to help advertisers buy the right impression to reach the right audience at the right time. Kokai also incorporates new measurement capabilities that let advertisers assess retail-campaign performance and CTV ad quality.\n\nUltimately, Kokai should reduce friction and improve campaign outcomes for advertisers. That value proposition should bring more media buyers to The Trade Desk and help the company capture a greater portion of advertising budgets.\n\nThe Trade Desk stock is not cheap, but the price is tolerable\n\nDigital ad spending is forecasted to increase at 15.5% annually through 2030, but The Trade Desk should grow more quickly given its strong presence in the quickly expanding CTV and retail-media channels. The company also believes it can accelerate growth in international markets. That is noteworthy because North America currently accounts for 88% of ad spending on the platform.\n\nWith that in mind, Wall Street analysts expect The Trade Desk to grow sales at 20% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22.4 times sales seem tolerable, though certainly not cheap. Investors should expect volatility in the near term, but The Trade Desk could create significant shareholder value in the long run. Now is a good time to buy a small position in this growth stock.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and The Trade Desk made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 25, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 hot tech stocks to invest in now. To skip our analysis of the recent technology trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Hot Tech Stocks to Invest in Now.\n\nThe technology sector is going through a major transition with the advent of generative artificial intelligence. There have been rapid developments in the sector since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), launched in November 2022. The platform received widespread acceptance with tens of millions of users flocking to the model. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) followed up with Google Bard which is giving strong competition to other LLMs.\n\nWith significant investment from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in OpenAI, reportedly to the tune of billions of dollars, OpenAI has made significant improvements to its model. In addition, Microsoft has integrated some of the features of the LLM into its suit of products. Artificial intelligence is seen to be the main factor in the recent performance of Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) share price as well as quarterly results. Several other companies are working on their own LLMs or have already launched their own models for different purposes. In addition, companies are focusing on utilizing the power of generative AI to improve processes, products and services, and experiences, in any shape and form. This has suddenly raised the demand for higher computational power and the hardware required to run it.\n\nInvesco S&P 500® Equal Weight Technology ETF equally weights stocks in the information technology sector of the S&P 500® Index. The underlying Index for the ETF has generated a 1-year return of 33.20%, compared to a 30.45% return for the broader S&P 500 Index during the same period. According to a report, investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain.

(NYSE:SQ) is among the 12 hot tech stocks to invest in now.\n\n11. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)\n\n3-Month Average Volume: 13.94M\n\nYear-to-date Performance: 13.05%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Marvell Technology, Inc.

Nearly all of the Company's N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity.”\n\n9.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Attracting More of the Big Money?",
        "content": "When most people buy a company's shares, it doesn't affect the stock's overall momentum very much. Individual investors are small fish in a big ocean. But there are some big fish whose moves can significantly impact a stock's momentum.\n\nInstitutional investors include large organizations such as investment firms, insurers, and pension funds. They're sometimes called the \"big money\" because of the massive size of their investments.\n\nAs you might imagine, institutional investors own major stakes in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That's to be expected since these are some of the biggest companies in the world. But which Magnificent Seven stocks are attracting more of the big money?\n\nThe biggest winners\n\nRoughly 65.5% of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are owned by institutional investors. The big money has moved into the chipmaker more than any other Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nNasdaq's data shows that 2,202 institutional holders have increased their positions in Nvidia based on the latest round of regulatory filings, and another 1,540 decreased their positions in the stock. Although 112 institutional investors exited their positions in Nvidia, 436 initiated new stakes.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) trails close behind Nvidia. Nasdaq reports that 2,545 institutional investors have increased their positions in Amazon, compared to 1,852 who have decreased their positions. Another 440 initiated new positions in the stock, with 119 fully selling their positions.\n\nLarge investors have also flocked to Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Between the Google parent's class A and class C shares, 3,877 institutional investors increased their positions in the stock, while 3,514 decreased them. According to Nasdaq, 758 institutional investors have initiated new positions in Alphabet, compared to 201 who have exited their positions.\n\nWhy is the big money flowing to Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet? The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom is almost certainly the top reason.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI apps, and Amazon and Alphabet operate cloud platforms where organizations can deploy generative AI apps. Alphabet also has a large language model (Gemini) that ranks among the most powerful in the world.\n\nMiddle of the pack\n\nTwo other Magnificent Seven stocks are in the middle of the pack for institutional investor interest. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of big money, but not to the same extent as Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nNasdaq's latest numbers show that 1,951 institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Meta, versus 1,503 who decreased their positions. New stakes have been initiated by 418 institutional investors, compared to 108 who exited their positions in the stock.\n\nTesla's institutional ownership is lower than the other Magnificent Seven members. However, 1,627 institutional investors recently increased their stakes in the electric-vehicle maker -- well above the 1,243 who decreased their positions. Also, 336 institutional investors opened new positions in Tesla, with only 140 completely selling their stakes.\n\nThe bottom two\n\nThis leaves Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the bottom two. The number of institutional investors increasing their positions in Microsoft topped the number decreasing their positions by only a narrow margin -- 2,492 to 2,431. The story was worse for Apple, with 2,571 big investors decreasing their positions in the stock, compared to 2,143 increasing their positions.\n\nHowever, there was some good news for these two tech giants. New positions for Microsoft outgained sold-out positions by 422 to 99. There was a similar ratio for Apple with 396 new positions and 77 sold-out positions.\n\nShould you follow the big money?\n\nInvesting in the same stocks that institutional investors are buying can sometimes be smart. The big money flowing in can push share prices higher.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that any data you see about institutional buying and selling reflects past transactions. Institutional investors could have recently soured on a stock they were bullish about previously.\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks face risks. Valuations are high for some of them, notably including Nvidia and Microsoft. Growth is slowing for Apple and Tesla, and competition is intense for all seven.\n\nHowever, I think each Magnificent Seven stock has solid long-term prospects. Even if you're a small investor, you could make your own version of big money from any of them if you buy and hold.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 countries with most billionaires in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Countries With Most Billionaires in 2024.\n\nChina Loses 155 Billionaires\n\nThe three largest economies in the world including China, India, and the United States lead with the highest number of billionaires in 2024. China and the US have no competition when it comes to paving the way for millionaires to become billionaires due to large markets and growth potential. India is not behind too and is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. China, India, and the US will be the top three largest economies in the world by 2100. China will be the leading economy followed by India and the US. According to the Hurun report for the Global Rich List 2024, the United States added the most billionaires, introducing 109 new billionaires to the list. India was the second best country, adding 84 new people to the list of billionaires. Though foreseeable, China caught most off guard and lost 155 billionaires due to the economic distress and property market crisis.\n\nChina’s economy is going through a systemic slowdown. As we mentioned in our article about 36 countries with deflation or dangerously low inflation, China is suffering from low inflation and it could lead to deflation. China had a successive series of declines in its consumer price index (CPI) during 2023, which started falling in January 2023 and continued till July 2023. The CPI plunged from 104 points in January 2023 to 102.7 points in July 2023. China’s bigger issue is its property market crisis. China's real estate development dropped by 9.6% and home sales fell by 6.5% in 2023. More than 50 real estate companies have defaulted on debt due to the property market crash in China. Real estate giant, The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) is one of the many companies facing default. On March 22, Reuters reported that Chinese authorities are looking into PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for its potential role in The China Evergrande Group’s (OTC:EGRNQ) $78 billion fraud. In addition, the Chinese authorities have fined The China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNQ) and Chairman Hui Ka Yan 4.2 billion yuan and 47 million yuan, respectively. The company and chairman have been fined for accounting and bond issuance fraud.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaires Benefiting from AI\n\nGlobally, billionaires increased by 167 to a total of 3,279 in 2024, as per the Hurun report. New York claimed the first spot for the first time in seven years with 119 billionaires choosing to live there followed by London with 97 billionaires. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a main cause for the rise of billionaires as half of new billionaires were driven by AI. Around 10% of the billionaires were from financial services, followed by 8% in consumer goods and 7% in food and beverages. Here is what Hurun’s chief researcher, Rupert Hoogewerf, said:\n\n“AI has been the major driver for wealth growth, generating over half of all the new wealth this year. Whilst Jensen Huang has grabbed many of the headlines as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) broke through the $2 trillion mark and catapulting into the Hurun Top 30 as a result, the billionaires behind Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have seen significant surges in their wealth as investors bet on the value of generated AI.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the real deal with a massive success in AI. In the last six months, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has soared over 100% due to its success in AI, as of March 29. On March 18, the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, during the NVIDIA GTC 2024 Keynote announced the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. This platform is built on purpose to power the new era of AI computing. The NVIDIA Blackwell GPU will be used in the automotive industry and will be integrated into the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor centralized car computer to support generative AI applications and immersive in-vehicle experiences.\n\nMark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has jumped 12 places to fourth spot among the world’s richest people. Zuckerberg has a net worth of around $170 billion, as of March 29, 2024. A year ago in 2023, Zuckerberg’s net worth was around $90 billion. In the last six months, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares have soared over 185%, as of March 29, driven by the AI hype. On February 1, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $5.33, beating consensus estimates by $0.39. The revenue came in at around $40.11 billion, surpassing estimates by $940.64 million. Here are some of the comments from the company’s Q4 2023 earning call:\n\n“This was a good quarter, and it wrapped up an important year for our community and our company. We estimate that there are more than 3.1 billion people who use at least one of our apps each day. 2023 was our year of efficiency, which focused on making Meta a stronger technology company and improving our business to give us the stability to deliver our ambitious long-term vision for AI and the metaverse. And last year, not only did we achieve our efficiency goals, but we returned to strong revenue growth, saw strong engagement across our apps; shipped a number of exciting new products like Threads, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and mixed reality in Quest 3; and of course, established a world-class AI effort that's going to be the foundation for many of our future products.\n\nNow moving forward, a major goal, we'll be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services. And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with.”\n\nWith this context, let’s take a look at the countries with most billionaires in 2024. 25 Countries With Most Billionaires in 2024\n\nA crowded Wall Street plaza, bustling with people carrying briefcases.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 25 countries with most billionaires in 2024, we took the data from the Hurun Global Rich List 2024.

        "content": "(Adds details, background throughout)\n\nWASHINGTON, March 29 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Friday revised rules aimed at making it harder for China to access U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) chips and chipmaking tools, part of an effort to hobble Beijing's chipmaking industry over national security concerns.\n\nThe rules, released in October, seek to halt shipments to China of more advanced AI chips designed by Nvidia and others as Washington cracks down on Beijing over concerns its advancing tech sector could help boost China's military.\n\nThe new rules, which run 166 pages in length, go into effect on Thursday. They clarify, for example, that restrictions on chip shipments to China also apply to laptops containing those chips.\n\nThe Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has said it plans to continue updating its restrictions on technology shipments to China as it seeks to bolster and fine-tune the measures.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best growth ETFs to buy now. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, check out 5 Best Growth ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nWhen interest rates went up in 2023, things changed. Companies had to rethink their plans and prioritize financial resilience over mere growth. Despite two years of interest rate increases causing some disruptions, the global economy has stayed strong regardless of persistent inflation. Developed economies in the West might see ongoing lower inflation as they move from a slow start to an economic recovery later in the year. Even though interest rates rose quickly in 2022 and 2023, many developed countries continued to grow, showing signs of strain only recently. For 2024, Invescopredicts a slight global economic slowdown, especially during the first half of the year. The United States has been resilient compared to the slowing growth in the eurozone and the UK. However, Invesco expects this slowdown to be short-lived as monetary policy adjusts to falling inflation. The firm believes that major central banks in developed countries have likely finished hiking interest rates and will start cutting them as growth slows and inflation calms down. This should help the economy recover towards normal growth in the second half of 2024 as people's wages rise due to lower inflation.\n\nDuring economic downturns, value stocks, which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, often suffer significant declines due to investor concerns. However, they tend to perform well as the economy begins to recover. Interestingly, the rebound of value stocks following the COVID-19 pandemic was not as strong as expected. This could be because investors in 2023 anticipated a recession that did not occur. Additionally, the anticipated fiscal spending in 2024 from government acts like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act could boost sectors like finance and industrials. On the other hand, the recovery in 2023 also revived growth stocks following the downturn in 2022. Therefore, Morgan Stanleysuggests that investors looking to add value stocks to their portfolios should not do so at the expense of growth stocks, which still offer potential in areas like consumer discretionary and technology. Investors might also want to consider reducing their exposure to defensive sectors such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities. While these sectors were favored during the bear market in 2022, they did not perform as well when the stock market rebounded in 2023 and may continue to underperform in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management, investors should overlook concerns regarding elevated valuations and instead concentrate on growth in what he described as a \"stockpicker's market.\" He pointed out that a significant portion of the recent market surge has been driven by the \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech stocks, but they are now exhibiting varying performance trends. While there has been extensive discussion about the lofty valuations of US stocks, Orton argued that making historical comparisons may not be applicable. This is because today's market makeup is distinct, with growth stocks anticipated to achieve higher-than-average earnings growth rates, often due to their involvement in rapidly advancing sectors like technology and AI, or because they offer distinctive products or services that confer a competitive advantage, such as healthcare firms with highly sought-after weight loss medications. Matt Orton commented:\n\n“I fully think that the market could push 20, 21 times, and that’s a perfectly fair multiple for us to pay. It’s all about earnings growth and it’s all about leaning into where those fundamentals are, and trying to avoid the parts of the market where you don’t have a positive inflection in earnings. And if you do that, no matter what the valuation is, you can grow into it, and I think that’s the main message for investors, is ‘find growth.’”\n\nSome of the best growth stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Broadcom Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

(NASDAQ:META)—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, at a highly attractive valuation during a period when apprehension about the company’s competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.\n\nSince we initiated our position, the company has delivered impressive operating results. With two of the highest ROI and most resilient ad formats in Search and YouTube, Google occupies a dominant position in the secularly fast-growing digital advertising market. As the digital advertising market recovered over the course of the year, revenue growth in Google’s advertising business accelerated from 3% in Q1 2023 to 10% in Q4 2023. Moreover, the company realized significant progress on its substantial margin expansion opportunity and maintained a robust capital return program. In 2023, operating profit margins expanded by approximately 225 basis points (bps), excluding one-time severance and real estate charges, as the Cloud segment reached breakeven profitability. We expect continued cost control, automation efficiencies, and operating leverage in under-earning segments (Cloud & YouTube) to sustain margin expansion as Google invests behind AI initiatives.\n\nThe company is using its ample free cash flow to repurchase approximately 4% of its outstanding shares on an annual basis…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7.

Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease.

        "title": "Should You Investigate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) At US$904?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at NVIDIA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nIs NVIDIA Still Cheap?\n\nNVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that NVIDIA’s ratio of 74.73x is above its peer average of 29.23x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from NVIDIA? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Micron Technology",
        "content": "Both Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) have been highly profitable investments in the past year, with their share prices rising rapidly thanks to the way artificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged their businesses.\n\nWhile Nvidia stock has gained 255% in the past year, Micron's gains stand at 91%. If you are looking to add one of these two AI stocks to your portfolio right now, which one should you be buying?\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been the go-to supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for major cloud computing companies looking to train AI models. The demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs was so strong last year that its customers were waiting for as long as 11 months to get their hands on the company's hardware, according to investment bank UBS.\n\nNvidia's efforts to manufacture more AI chips and meet this heightened customer demand have been successful, allowing it to lower the wait time to three to four months. This goes some way to explaining why the company's growth has been stunning in recent quarters. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue shot up a whopping 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped 486% to $5.16 per share.\n\nThat eye-popping growth is set to continue in the current quarter. Nvidia's revenue estimate of $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 would translate into a year-over-year gain of 233%.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the company's earnings to jump to $5.51 per share in the current quarter, which would be a 5x increase over the year-ago period's reading of $1.09 per share. Even better, Nvidia should be able to sustain its impressive momentum for the rest of the fiscal year as well, especially since it expects the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture to exceed supply.\n\nNvidia management pointed out on its February earnings conference call that, although the supply of its current-generation chips is improving, the next-generation products will be \"supply constrained.\" That won't be surprising, as Nvidia's upcoming AI GPUs, which will start shipping later in 2024, are reportedly four times more powerful when training AI models as compared to the current H100 processor.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia also expects a 30 times increase in the AI inference performance with its Blackwell AI GPUs. This should help it cater to a fast-growing segment of the AI chip market, as the market for AI inference chips is expected to grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2030, according to reporting from Verified Market Research.\n\nThe good part is that customers are already lining up for Nvidia's Blackwell processors, with Meta Platforms expecting to train future generations of its Llama large language model (LLM) using the latest chips.\n\nAll this explains why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's earnings to increase from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024 to almost $37 per share in fiscal 2027. That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, suggesting that Nvidia could remain a top AI growth play going forward.\n\nThe case for Micron Technology\n\nThe booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is turning out to be a solid tailwind for Micron Technology. That's because Nvidia's AI GPUs are powered by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) from the likes of Micron.\n\nOn its recent earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that Nvidia will be deploying its HBM chips in the H200 processors, which are set to be available to customers beginning in the second quarter. Micron management also added that it is \"making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.\"\n\nThe demand for Micron's HBM chips is so strong that it has sold out its entire capacity for 2024. What's more, the memory specialist says that \"the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated,\" indicating that AI will continue to drive robust demand for Micron's chips.\n\nMicron is also looking to push the envelope in the HBM market. The company has started sampling a new HBM chip with 50% higher memory, which will allow the likes of Nvidia to make more powerful AI chips going forward. As such, booming HBM demand will positively impact Micron's financials, with the company estimating that it will \"generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024.\"\n\nThe HBM market is expected to generate almost $17 billion in revenue this year -- accounting for 20% of overall DRAM industry revenue -- as compared to $4.4 billion in 2023. Even better, it could keep getting bigger in the long run on the back of the fast-growing AI chip market. As a result, Micron should be able to sustain the impressive growth it has started clocking now.\n\nThe company's revenue in the recently reported fiscal second quarter of 2024 (which ended on Feb. 29) was up 57% year over year to $5.82 billion. The revenue guidance of $6.6 billion for the ongoing quarter would be a bigger jump of 76% from the year-ago period. So, Micron's aggressive AI-driven growth is just getting started.\n\nThe verdict\n\nGiven the data above, Micron may turn out to be the better AI play compared to Nvidia because of one simple reason: At almost 37 times sales, Nvidia stock is way more expensive when compared to Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 6.4. Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nOf course, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Micron, and it could justify its expensive valuation by sustaining its terrific growth. However, investors looking for a cheaper way to play the AI boom are likely to consider Micron for their portfolios, considering its attractive valuation and the rapid growth it offers right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "GRAPHIC-How the US stock market rocketed through the first quarter",
        "content": "(Updates with full first-quarter data)\n\nBy Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is off to a soaring start in 2024, as optimism over the economy and interest rate cuts has combined with exuberance about the business opportunity in artificial intelligence to stir up a potent cocktail for equities.\n\nThe S&P 500 has climbed more than 10% so far this year to post its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019. The benchmark index in late January hit its first record high in two years, as it built on a surge in late 2023, and has not looked back, setting more than a dozen highs without a significant pullback so far in 2024.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite in late February also registered its first record high since November 2021.\n\nKey to this year's gains has been confidence from investors that the economy is set for a \"soft landing\", in which inflation moderates but the economy avoids a severe downturn.\n\nNearly two-thirds of fund managers saw a soft landing as the most likely outcome for the economy in the next 12 months, while only 11% projected a \"hard landing\", according to BofA Global Research's latest monthly survey published in March.\n\nA dovish Federal Reserve meeting this month, in which the central bank kept its view of three interest rate cuts this year while upgrading its economic outlook, has also encouraged many investors.\n\nStocks have been able to defy a rise in Treasury yields, after rising yields were a pressure point for equities in 2023. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was last around 4.2%, up from 3.86% at the end of last year.\n\n\"As Q2 kicks off, we still see a more supportive near-term backdrop for risk-taking....,\" strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute, which is overweight U.S. stocks, said in a note this week. \"We think upbeat risk appetite can broaden out beyond tech as more sectors adopt AI, and as market confidence is buoyed by recent Fed messaging and broadly falling inflation.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch optimism has helped drive up stock valuations. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed to 21, its highest level in more than two years, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nThe stock market continues to be propelled by some of the megacap companies that led the way in 2023.\n\nBut after all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech and growth stocks posted huge gains in 2023, this year has seen them go separate ways.\n\nNvidia continues to shine, surging more than 80% so far this year fueled by its gold-standard chips for AI. Meta Platforms is another big winner on the year, jumping 37%, with the Facebook parent issuing its first dividend in February.\n\nOther megacaps have not fared so well. Apple shares have slipped 11%, with the iPhone maker hurt by pressure on its China business and from antitrust regulators. Tesla has tumbled 29%, hit by worries about electric vehicle demand.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven were responsible for 40% of the S&P 500's year-to-date gain as of late last week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of more than 60% last year for the megacap group.\n\nOther stocks have helped pick up the slack this year, indicating the rally is broadening.\n\nTech and communication services - sectors that house a combined five of the Magnificent Seven - are among the top S&P 500 sectors so far this year. But energy , financials and industrials are also outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nRecent performance is \"providing early signs that investors are beginning to look for opportunities outside Big Tech and in anticipation of lower interest rates later this year,\" Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said in a market comment on Monday.\n\nInvestors have also been fixated on which companies stand to benefit from increasing use of AI.\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for AI enthusiasm, but a clutch of chipmakers and other tech stocks have also registered massive gains, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings. In the latest sign of AI fervor, shares of chip firm Astera Labs have more than doubled from its initial public offering price a week ago.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Megan Davies, Aurora Ellis and Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the semiconductor sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSemiconductor Industry Outlook\n\nThe semiconductor space is now more exciting than it ever has been before. While 2023 was a year of struggle for most industries, including the semiconductor industry, 2024 promises a growth spurt. This March, KPMG released its Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook for 2024, where it noted some of the key things to look forward to when it comes to semiconductors while highlighting significant challenges posing a threat to this space. KPMG surveyed 172 semiconductor executives for its report, 85% of whom stated that they anticipate the industry to see double-digit revenue growth in 2024. The main growth drivers for the semiconductor industry today continue to be the automotive industry, artificial intelligence, and microprocessors. While these trends and developments continue to propel semiconductors upward, a majority of semiconductor executives believe that there is a lack of skilled talent in the industry, which poses a significant risk to its growth.\n\nThe Blackwell Chip\n\nPerhaps the most significant recent event in the semiconductor industry was the GTC Conference hosted by semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), this March. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, made several major announcements in his keynote at the conference, but perhaps the most anticipated and exciting one was the unveiling of the company's latest chip, the Blackwell, named after David Blackwell, who was the first African American inducted into the National Academy of Sciences, and the first African American tenured professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In his announcement during his keynote, Huang compared the Blackwell chip to its predecessor, the Hopper, which had been the most advanced GPU in the world before the Blackwell's creation. Huang highlighted that the Blackwell chip comprises 208 billion transistors, followed by these comments on the chip:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There's a small line between two dyes. This is the first time two dyes have been abutted like this together, in such a way that the two dyes think it's one chip. There's 10 terabytes of data between it, 10 terabytes per second, so that these two sides of the Blackwell chip have no clue which side they're on. There's no memory locality issues, no cache issues, it's just one giant chip. And so, when we were told that Blackwell's ambitions were beyond the limits of physics, the engineer said 'so what?' And so this is what happened.\"\n\nWith the introduction of this new chip in the semiconductor space, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has marked itself as the leader in the industry, way ahead of other notable and successful competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a popular semiconductor stock pick for investors for quite some time now, and this popularity is only continuing to expand and grow exponentially.\n\nThis growth is not limited to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) alone either - semiconductor companies across the globe are attracting mass amounts of investor attention because of what they have to offer to investors' portfolios in the age of artificial intelligence and new innovations in tech. The only issue that can arise in this arena is skepticism from analysts and investors who may believe that this boom in the semiconductor industry may not last and may, in fact, be creating a lot of unwarranted hype. However, our research shows that several analysts consider several major semiconductor stocks still undervalued compared to their intrinsic worth. As such, we have compiled a list of the best cheap semiconductor stocks to buy. These include some high-growth semiconductor stocks alongside some of the best semiconductor stocks to buy for the AI boom. 13 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics\n\nA leading semiconductor chip on a computer robot arm, reflecting the technology advances of the company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe compiled our list of the best cheap semiconductor stocks to buy by using a stock screener to identify semiconductor companies with P/E ratios below 25 as of March 27. The stocks were then shortlisted based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nUndervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\n11. Allegro MicroSystems, Inc.

In July, we trimmed our position as its shares rallied ahead of its quarterly report. Then in August, Allegro reported better-than-anticipated results and increased its near-term guidance. However, on the earnings call its management seemed more cautious with the outlook, especially related to volatility for its sales in China, and Allegro’s shares pulled back by -30%. Speaking with management later, we gained a better sense of short-term concerns with China—that comprise less than a quarter of Allegro’s business—and the expected rebound, so we added back to our position.”\n\nAllegro MicroSystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGM) is among the top names on our list of cheap semiconductor stocks and is highly popular among hedge funds, just like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best 5G stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To see more such companies, go directly to the 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominating headlines, another technological advancement is quietly gaining momentum and warrants investors' attention: 5G technology. Representing the next generation of mobile internet, 5G is poised to replace 4G, offering ultra-fast speeds and significantly lower latency, enhancing communication time between devices.\n\nEricsson, a telecommunications company, stated in its mobility report that by 2028, 5G will emerge as the primary mobile access technology by subscription. Globally, 5G subscriptions are expected to surpass 5.3 billion in 2029, constituting 58% of all mobile subscriptions at that point. Further projections indicate that by 2029, North America and the GCC will boast the highest 5G penetration at 92%, followed closely by Western Europe at 85%.\n\nOf course, while the penetration of 5G connectivity is expected to open up new growth opportunities in both hardware and software sectors, a 2020 report by Edward Jones highlighted that the full realization of 5G may take considerable time due to the complexity of its technical infrastructure requirements. The report emphasized that the deployment of 5G would not reach completion levels until software developers conduct extensive testing and exploration to determine the most effective utilization of the high speeds and responsiveness unlocked by 5G technology. Consumer sentiment echoes this observation, with many 5G smartphone users indicating that their devices have yet to fully leverage the capabilities of the technology. Deloitte's research reveals that a significant majority (53%) of 5G smartphone users are actively looking for applications and experiences that can harness the advanced capabilities of the network. Additionally, a notable 26% expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of innovative apps and services specifically designed for the 5G environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors should take note that despite the short-term headwinds in the 5G sector, such as those experienced by Nokia this past year, the economic benefits of the 5G revolution are expected to be far and wide. Grand View Research projects that the 5G services market will experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 59.4% from 2023 to 2030. This growth trajectory is anticipated to be driven b y the convergence of other sub-sectors of technology, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and high-speed data connectivity, which collectively will catalyze market expansion.\n\nInvestors looking to capitalize on the potential of 5G should adopt a diversified strategy by investing in various sectors of the 5G ecosystem. This includes companies involved in providing 5G network equipment, tower infrastructure, semiconductors, hyperscalers, and mobile network operators. In that regard, some of the best 5G stocks to buy include the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

        "title": "13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 high growth value stocks to invest in according to Seth Klarman. If you want to skip our overview of value stocks and an introduction to Klarman's investing history, then you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman.\n\nOne of the more well known investment strategies on Wall Street, which has also seen some of the most professional investors attest to its success is value investing. When compared to today's high frequency trading and quantitative model based stock market trading environment, value investment is a classical approach that evaluates whether a firm's underlying fundamentals and business models can cause share price appreciation in the future.\n\nTwo of the most well known value investors of our time are Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of the Buapost Group. Buffett's Berkshire is one of the biggest investment holding companies in the world, with Insider Monkey's research showing that the combined value of its 13F investments as of December 2023 end was a whopping $347 billion. As part of our regular coverage of hedge fund investments, Insider Monkey also analyzed Berkshire's Q4 2023 investment portfolio as part of our coverage of Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 12 Stock Picks. You can take a look at the portfolio by clicking on the link, but the top three picks were American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAnother follower of value investing is Seth Klarman. His hedge fund had $4.5 in Q4 2023 holdings, and some of the biggest positions were technology companies such as Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). So what is value investing? Well, the key principle of this strategy is determining the fair value of stock and comparing it with the market price through a metric called the margin of safety. The margin of safety is the difference between the fair value and the market price, and the greater this difference is, the more comfortable a value investor feels in betting their money on an equity.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like we have done with Buffett's investments, we also took a look at Klarman's value stock picks. The latest such coverage was 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman), and the top three stocks in this list were Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA), and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS). Since it's March 2024, it's important to see how well these stocks have performed over the past six months since they were disclosed by Baupost for Q3 2023. Well, the three stocks' share price performance over the past six months has been 27.73%, 27%, and 26%. Interestingly, all three of Klarman's top value stock picks in Q3 are up by 26% or 27%, despite the fact that these are relatively stable companies with few catchy products like NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPU.\n\nFinally, before we head to our list of the high growth value stock picks of Seth Klarman, Warren Buffett's latest letter to Berkshire shareholders also features some hidden gems for value investing. In his letter, Buffett shares:\n\nSpeed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school.\n\nThese seizures are the perfect opportunity for value investing since they can open up large differentials between the fair value and the market price. Buffett's long history of trading has also seen him capitalize on such seizures early in his career, with perhaps the most notable being his trifles with the shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at Seth Klarman's top high growth value stocks. A couple of notable names are Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 13 High Growth Value Stocks to Invest in According to Seth Klarman\n\nSeth Klarman of Baupost Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Seth Klarman's high growth value stocks, we ranked all stocks in Baupost Group's Q4 2023 investment portfolio by their 3-year average revenue growth rate (5-year if the 3-year estimate was in the red) and picked the top stocks. The revenue growth data was sourced from Morningstar Financial.\n\nFor these high growth value stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media.\n\nThe United States economy has been hit hard by inflation concerns in the past two years, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates in a bid to curb surging prices. Over the last few months, however, inflation numbers have started stagnating. Latest data indicates that even though inflation was clocked at 3.2% in February, up slightly from 3.1% at the end of January, the annual rate of inflation actually slipped from 3.9% at the end of January to 3.8% at the end of last month. The central bank aims to bring this number down to around 2% and pave the way to a loosening of monetary policy.\n\nCoupled with the resilience in the labor market, financial experts predict that positive growth numbers from the end of 2023 extend the runway for the central bank to act to bring down rates. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global, recently told Financial Times that if the financial conditions continued to ease like they had done over the past few months, growth will likely remain strong, He also forecast that such conditions would allow the Federal Reserve to delay rate cuts. Ellen Zentner, the chief US economist at investment advisory Morgan Stanley, echoed these comments, noting that strong growth would extend the runway the Fed has to act over rate cuts.\n\nDespite uncertainty regarding financial policy, investors at the stock market have been bullish on the health of the US economy. Benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite have rocketed since the start of the new year. The former is up nearly 9% year-to-date and the latter has grown by more than 10%. Key stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also surging, the first two registering returns of 10.3% and 92% since the turn of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA prominent theme for growth this year is artificial intelligence. Jensen Huang, the CEO of chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), recently highlighted the steps that the firm was taking to emerge as a leader in this space. During the fourth quarter earnings call, Huang called the present AI boom an inflection point that had triggered a sense of urgency at the enterprise level to develop strategies in the AI world. He cautioned, however, that the AI supercomputer infrastructure and model algorithms remain an insurmountable obstacle for most.\n\n“I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer. We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds. Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software, or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, and others on the way.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we scoured the top stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, Kiplinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 20 Best Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media\n\nA financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.\n\nBest Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Financial Media\n\n20.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide.

Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Other bottom contributors included Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Carrier Global and Becton, Dickinson. Shares of integrated oil and gas company Chevron were pressured as global oil production is growing — particularly in the US, which has now surpassed its past production levels — in turn pressuring oil prices and company profit margins.”\n\n18. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCitigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a financial services holding company that provides various financial products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions. On February 14, investment advisory Piper Sandler upgraded Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stock to Overweight from Neutral and raised the price target to $63 from $56.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 87 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), compared to 79 in the previous quarter worth $6.9 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Silver Beech Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Citigroup (“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.\n\nAs a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.\n\nCiti’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion. The global consumer bank has been a drag on Citi’s overall performance…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n15. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) makes and sells networking and other products. On February 15, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n14. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)operates as a diversified software company worldwide. On January 2, investment advisory Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock and raised the price target to $705 from $650.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) with 4.5 million shares worth more than $2.7 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n13. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 162\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a California-based payments technology firm. On January 27, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock and raised the price target to $319 from $304.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 162 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $26.5 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 167 in the preceding quarter worth $24.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble’s clients, we occasionally tell them that we’re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Most people carry both.\n\nPeople carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they’ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren’t going to get paid…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n12. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 83\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides travel and restaurant online reservation and related services worldwide. On February 26, investment advisory Argus maintained a Buy rating on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock and raised the price target to $4,100 from $3,677.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $10.2 billion in Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), compared to 81 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor firm. On March 7, investment advisory Mizuho maintained a Buy rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and raised the price target to $235 from $200.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 28 million shares worth more than $4.1 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n10. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 111\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) markets analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products. On February 1, investment advisory RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NYSE:TMO), up from 109 in the preceding quarter worth $8.9 billion.\n\n9. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 79\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. On March 4, investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock with a price target of $45.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) with 11.6 million shares worth more than $334 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Among our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.”\n\n8. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 242\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) stock and raised the price target to $575 from $435.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 242 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $44 billion in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 in the preceding quarter worth $35 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, SaltLight Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) primary mission is all about capitalising on user engagement and maintaining its network effects. AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“As for other quarterly contributors, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc., (META) added to their exceptional year-to-date returns. Meta Platforms and Alphabet were the true year-to-date standouts. After steep declines in 2022, both stocks rebounded sharply due to a combination of solid fundamentals, disciplined operational execution, and improved sentiment. Despite outsized gains and attention, we think both Alphabet and Meta remain undervalued.”\n\n6. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 3\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) develops, manufactures, and markets products that enable physicians and healthcare providers to enhance the quality of and access to minimally invasive care.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable tech stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the technology industry, then you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said with certainty it's that technology runs the stock market - both figuratively and literally. Stock trading in 2024 is vastly different from trading in 1924, and at the heart of this shift is the computer. Similarly, back then, the U.S. economy was primarily dominated by industrial firms, meaning that movements in their share prices could end up setting the mood for broader indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).\n\nNow, not only do computers run the stock markets, but firms that either make their hardware or software reign supreme in market capitalization as well. The biggest stocks in U.S. markets, and therefore in the world, are technology companies. Some of the most prolific ones due to their trillion dollar valuations are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The two account for a sizeable chunk of U.S. personal computing use, and this also underscores their valuations with investors being well aware of this role.\n\nSo naturally, 2023 has been the year of technology stocks, and the trend has so far persisted in 2024. This surge in technology stock prices comes after 2022, which was one of the worst years for the industry. In 2022, the semiconductor supply chain was at the start of a major glut, as manufacturers built up inventory based on models that had anticipated demand similar to levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic. These difficulties were exacerbated by high interest rates - which do not bode well for high growth stocks such as technology - and high inflation, which not only stresses corporate budgets but also makes it difficult for consumers to splurge for pricey gadgets such as Apple's 'spatial computing' device, the $3499 Apple Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, as the Vision Pro shows, technology stocks have to potential to continually surprise investors, media, and the public. With the first quarter of the new year now ending, analysts and investors are pouring over the latest products from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - Wall Street's artificial intelligence darling. NVIDIA recently held its GTC Developers conference, an annual event, where it revealed its latest Blackwell GPU for AI. This GPU promises to reduce operating costs and energy usage by up to 25 times when compared to predecessors.\n\nNVIDIA's chief Jensen Huang also provided details about Blackwell's design and costs in an interview with CNBC where he shared:\n\nYes, a mathematician, right? Yeah, yeah, really terrific mathematician. And this computer here will replace thousands of general-purpose computers. This is the part that's incredible. In fact, what's amazing is that the cables of connecting last generation general purpose computers, the cables of connecting them, cost more than the price of one of these computers. The amount of energy that we save is incredible. Megawatts and megawatts and megawatts. Because of this, we made it possible for the computer to write software by itself. It is so insanely fast. Now the software can write. The computer can write its own software. And we call that artificial intelligence.\n\nJensen also highlighted earlier in the talk with CNBC's Jim Cramer that a Blackwell chip can cost as much as $40,000 and that the research and development of the first generation of chips stood at a whopping $10 billion. NVIDIA is currently valued at $2.28 trillion, making the multi billion dollar spend a drop in its massive market capitalization. The shares have gained 248% over the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 Information Technology index's 53% gain over the past year by a wide margin.\n\nSo, with the dynamics of the global technology industry shifting, we decided to take a look at the top tech stocks in terms of net profit that hedge funds are buying. A couple of notable picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most profitable tech stocks to invest in, we ranked all technology companies by their trailing twelve month net income and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these most profitable tech stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n16 Most Profitable Tech Stocks To Invest In\n\n16.

        "title": "13 Hot Stocks to Invest in According to Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 hot stocks to invest in according to Wall Street analysts. If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the latest news, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Hot Stocks to Invest in According to Wall Street Analysts.\n\nJust like in 2023 and 2022, the stock market of 2024 is focused on the Federal Reserve. Now that investors are finished with the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence stocks, and are happy with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s latest supply and pricing details for the Blackwell artificial intelligence processors, they can now turn their focus back on what the Fed might or might not do later this year.\n\nThis macro trend can very well decide which stocks are hot or not. This is because high interest rates mean that high growth firms find it difficult to raise capital and the opportunity costs for investors to pile their money into speculative investments also go up. One of the strongest examples of this trend is stocks in the clean energy sector. Before the coronavirus pandemic, clean energy was one of the hottest sectors in the world with investors rushing in hand over fist. However, now that interest rates are high, clean energy stocks are in a bear market if we consider the 12-month performance of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. The index of clean energy stocks is down by nearly 27% over the past twelve months, and it is one of the strongest examples of potentially hot stocks if the Federal Reserve changes its course of action on interest rates.\n\nSo much so that investors have discovered that by betting on clean energy stocks, they can end up 'playing' the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. What this means is that if markets decide that the Fed will cut interest rates, then stocks such as those in the clean energy sector will see their prices appreciate on the back of bullish bets such as easy money being available for financing pricey projects such as wind power plants and solar farms.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor hot stocks, which are typically seeing higher trading volume and volatility than other stocks, a timely investment decision can yield benefits. In fact, we don't have to look too far to see how this has played out on the market. One of the hottest stocks of 2023 has been NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the Santa Clara, California based semiconductor designer whose graphics processing unit (GPU) chips are at the forefront of the global shift to advanced data analysis and computing techniques collectively dubbed as artificial intelligence.\n\nNVIDIA's shares are up by a stunning 627% since the last bottom of the semiconductor industry in the third quarter of 2022. Back then, the stock was trading for $120, meaning that the current trading price of $907 is beyond what most NVIDIA investors might have imagined would have been possible with their shares. Yet, even though NVIDIA's triple digit percentage share price appreciation does make it one of the hottest stocks of the past year or so, there are countless other examples of equities making similar jumps but in small time periods.\n\nTwo recent examples of such hot stocks are Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) and Elevation Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELEV). These are penny stocks that trade for roughly the same price ($4.34 - $4.64), and the stocks are up by 648% and 588% respectively, year to date. Unsurprisingly perhaps, both belong to the biotechnology sector, which is another area of the stock market that is highly sensitive to interest rates. The former is a biotechnology firm founded by professors from the illustrious Brown University, and the stock is up by 163% since Ocean Biomedical, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCEA) announced that its joint venture firm had made progress related to a Hepatitis B treatment. This treatment is particularly special, as according to the firm, it is the first human data from a genetically modified T-Cell vaccine.\n\nThe second hot stock, Elevation Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELEV), has also beaten NVIDIA's share price appreciation over the past year and a half, year to date in 2024. Elevation's shares popped in February end when it announced that its treatment that stops tumors from turning into cancer will now also include Japanese patients in its sample.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at what hot stocks are also finding favor among analysts. A couple of notable picks are Arch Capital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACGL), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR). 13 Hot Stocks to Invest in According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nA fireworks display, reflecting the company's success in the global trading market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top hot stocks according to analysts, we ranked the 30 best performing stocks of the S&P 500 year to date by their average analyst share price target percentage upside.\n\nFor these best hot stocks according to analysts, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Hot Stocks to Invest in According to Wall Street Analysts\n\n13.

        "content": "(0:30) - Is Now Still A Good Time To Invest Into Nvidia (5:00) - Learning From Nvidia And Its Partners Performance: Is There Still Room To Grow? (25:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, VRT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #395 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss if there is any value left in NVIDIA after its big rally of the last year.\n\nIs NVIDIA expensive now or is it a bargain stock thanks to its big growth trajectory?\n\nThe Case for Buying NVIDIA Right Now\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) shares are up 254% in the last year. It has also been one of the hottest stocks in 2024, gaining 91% during that time.\n\nWith NVIDIA trading at new all-time highs, why jump in now?\n\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 38.8. While that is not in the traditional value stock range, which is normally under 15, that is cheap for NVIDIA, which has often traded above 40x over the last 5 years.\n\nNVIDIA’s trajectory changed a year ago, as the demand for AI surged. It has beat, and raised, its earnings guidance each of the last four quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, NVIDIA saw record quarterly revenue up 265% year-over-year, to $22.1 billion.\n\nEarnings growth is equally as impressive. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see earnings jump another 84% in fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA’s Partners Also Expected to See Strong Growth\n\nSkeptical about NVIDIA’s rapid growth? Tracey takes a look at two of its data center partners to see what their sales and earnings trajectory looks like.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also in the AI trade. It’s hard to believe, but the stock has been even hotter than NVIDIA’s.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer are up 259% year-to-date and 823% over the last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut its sales and earnings consensus estimates are also tracking NVIDIA’s. Super Micro Computer’s sales in fiscal 2024 are expected to jump 103.5% year-over-year to $14.5 billion. The earnings are expected to rise 83.8%.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\n2. Vertiv Holding Co. (VRT)\n\nVertiv is another partner company with NVIDIA on the data center side of the AI trade. Shares have jumped 69% year-to-date and over the last year are up 531%.\n\nVertiv is also seeing big growth from AI. It has been beating, and raising earnings guidance, for the last several quarters. Vertiv’s earnings are now expected to jump 32.8% in 2024.\n\nSales are rising, but not as quickly asat  NVIDIA or Super Micro Computer. The Zacks sales consensus is looking for growth of 11.2% this year.\n\nVertiv is also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.\n\nIs NVIDIA Too Hot to Handle?\n\nIt’s difficult to buy a stock at, or near, a new all-time high. But NVIDIA’s shares have made new highs many times over the last 5 years, as shares have surged 2000%.\n\nFundamentals matter as much as the chart. And NVIDIA has strong fundamentals right now, including sales and earnings growth.\n\nShould NVIDIA be on Your Short List?\n\nTune into this week’s video podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT in her own personal portfolio and in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Nvidia (NVDA) is a Great Choice",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if NVDA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor NVDA, shares are up 7.35% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 1.5% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 16.21% compares favorably with the industry's 5.04% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Nvidia have increased 89.72% over the past quarter, and have gained 234.46% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.15% and 33.78%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to NVDA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. NVDA is currently averaging 61,106,484 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NVDA.\n\nOver the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NVDA's consensus estimate, increasing from $19.95 to $23.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that NVDA is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Nvidia on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Be in 5 Years? A Year 4 Update to My 2020 Predictions",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been hot over the short and long terms. Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader have returned a whopping 241% in just one year, and 21,320% over the 10-year period through March 27. (For context, the S&P 500 index returned 34% and 242%, respectively, over these periods.)\n\nGiven these amazing performances, it's natural to wonder if it's too late to invest in Nvidia stock. A tool that can be useful in helping you make investing decisions is the outlining of where you think a company's business will be in the future. Concentrate on the business; don't focus on the stock. Over the longer term, the stock will perform well if the business is performing well.\n\nIn March 2020, I outlined where I thought Nvidia's business would be in five years, or in March 2025. This article is a Year 4 update of those predictions.\n\n1. CEO Jensen Huang will still be leading the company\n\nStatus at Year 4: On target.\n\nIn March 2020, I wrote that \"as long as [Huang] stays healthy, the odds seem in favor of his still being at Nvidia's helm in five years.\" For context, co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang turned 61 earlier this year, according to public records.\n\nMany CEOs who are very wealthy retire early. But as I said in 2020, \"One only needs to listen to the company's quarterly earnings calls to know that this is a guy who just loves his work.\" Four years later, it's still evident that Huang is intellectually energized by his work.\n\n2. Nvidia will still be the leading supplier of graphics cards for computer gaming\n\nStatus at Year 4: On target -- and Nvidia has increased its market share.\n\nHere's a snippet from my March 2020 article:\n\nNvidia dominates the market for discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the key component in graphics cards for desktop computer gaming. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company controlled 68.9% of this market...\n\nNvidia has not only remained the leader in this category, but has increased its market share over the last four years. In the fourth quarter of 2023, it had an 80% share of the desktop discrete GPU market, compared with Advanced Micro Devices' 19% share, according to Jon Peddie Research. Intel, which entered this market in Q3 2022, had a 1% share.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. The global gaming market will continue its robust growth\n\nStatus at Year 4: On target.\n\nThe global video gaming market grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 13% during the four-year period ended in 2023, according to Statista. Its market size was about $250 billion in 2023.\n\n4. Nvidia's GPUs will still be the gold standard for AI training\n\nStatus at Year 4: On target -- and Nvidia has increased its market share.\n\nIn March 2020, I wrote, \"Nvidia is sitting in the catbird seat when it comes to profiting from this humongous [artificial intelligence] growth trend.\"\n\nThis topic is a huge one and deserves its own article. Suffice it to say here that Nvidia's dominance in the overall AI chip market has increased over the last four years. Moreover, the market size itself has been rapidly growing, thanks in large part to the strong demand for chips to enable generative AI capabilities. Generative AI, which is the tech behind OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, \"enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs,\" in the words of Nvidia.\n\n5. The legalization of driverless vehicles will turbocharge its auto platform's growth\n\nStatus at Year 4: My timeline will likely be too optimistic.\n\nThis topic also deserves its own article. In short, I still fully believe in this prediction, but my timeline will likely be too optimistic, so I get at least a partial \"ding\" in this category. In March 2020, I wrote:\n\nIn 2025, fully autonomous vehicles should be legal -- or very close to being so -- across the United States. Nvidia is well positioned to majorly profit from [this event]. It's inked partnerships with major players, [and I listed a bunch of auto industry companies].\n\n6. The X factor\n\nStatus at Year 4: Achieved.\n\nIn March 2020, I wrote, \"Nvidia is incredibly innovative, so there seems a great chance that the company will introduce at least one major new technology that takes nearly everyone by surprise.\"\n\nThis prediction has already come true. Nvidia has launched a handful of major new technologies that have likely surprised almost everyone. One example is its Omniverse platform, which enables enterprises to create their own metaverses. Data by YCharts.\n\n7. And Nvidia's stock price in 2025?\n\nStatus at Year 4: Even with one year left to 2025, it seems safe to say that my \"solidly outperform the market\" prediction in the below quote will hold true.\n\nHere's what I wrote in March 2020:\n\nIt's impossible to predict a company's stock price in five years because so many unknowns ... can have a huge influence on the market in general. That said, given the projections made in this article, I feel very comfortable predicting that Nvidia stock will solidly outperform the market over the next half decade. [Emphasis mine]\n\nAs the above chart shows, Nvidia stock has returned 1,210% in the just over four-year period since my March 2020 predictions article. The S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index have returned 81% and 89%, respectively, over this period.\n\nBased upon this four-year update to my 2020 predictions, I feel confident that Nvidia stock will solidly outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget SoundHound AI: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Since artificial intelligence's (AI)  burst in popularity early last year, investors have been captivated by the potential for AI stocks to go parabolic. Take SoundHound AI for example. Since reports emerged in mid-February that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) owned a stake in the company, its stock has exploded higher, soaring as much as 295% in the weeks that followed.\n\nHowever, investors should be careful, as following the herd can be costly. SoundHound AI has fallen out of favor with at least one formerly bullish analyst and has been the target of a short report that raises several valid concerns. Furthermore, SoundHound AI sells for 18 times next year's sales and, despite its impressive growth, has yet to generate a profit.\n\nThat's not to say this investment won't end up being a winner, but given the risky nature of this company, I would suggest investors forget SoundHound AI stock and look at these two AI leaders instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhen it comes to AI, there's a compelling argument that no other company is better positioned to ride the AI wave than Nvidia itself. The company adapted its technology to accelerate AI models years ago and is the undisputed leader in powering machine learning algorithms, with an estimated 95% market share, according to New Street Research.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia already had a wealth of experience when generative AI burst on the scene early last year. The company adapted its processors to provide the computational horsepower needed to run AI systems, and sales were off to the races.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion, fueling adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that soared 486% to $5.16. This marked the third consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth -- and it likely won't be the last. For the current quarter, management is forecasting record revenue of $24 billion, up 234% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are other reasons to believe Nvidia's growth spurt will continue. A great deal of AI processing and workloads take place in the cloud, and Nvidia has an edge there as well. The company has a market share estimated at 95% of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used in the data center space, according to CFRA equity analyst Angelo Zino.\n\nThe buildout of data centers capable of AI processing has already begun. CEO Jensen Huang suggests that the spending necessary to bring data centers up to par will double to $2 trillion over the next several years.\n\nNvidia isn't exactly cheap at 38 times forward earnings but has earned the premium thanks to its triple-digit growth.\n\nRather than buy the stock that Nvidia bought, why not just buy Nvidia itself?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nAnother company that's already reaping the benefits of the accelerating adoption of generative AI is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly referred to as Supermicro. The company also plays a big part in the processing of AI, developing the servers robust enough to handle the AI workload.\n\nThe company partners with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, to ensure its servers are optimized to work with their latest and most robust processors. Furthermore, these collaborations ensure that Supermicro has a steady supply of AI-centric chips to power its servers.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Supermicro produced net sales of $3.66 billion, which surged 103% year over year, driving adjusted EPS of $5.59, up 71%. Management was clear that its record revenue was the result of strong demand for rack-scale systems used for AI.\n\nThere are those who believe that Supermicro is taking share from its rivals. Barclays analyst George Wang posits that Supermicro \"has 7% market share globally, implying further share gains ahead are likely.\" He goes on to suggest that Supermicro is stealing share from Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\n\nFurthermore, the aforementioned data center upgrade cycle benefits Supermicro as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has calculated that the AI server market will grow 75% annually over the next three years, calling the resulting buildout \"unprecedented.\"\n\nSupermicro's stock has surged, up 842% over the past year (as of this writing), yet is still remarkably cheap at less than 3 times next year's sales.\n\nGiven its bargain-basement valuation and history of profits, Supermicro is a far better AI stock than SoundHound AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Biotech Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers in the Making: March Edition",
        "content": "Last year was a tough one for biotech stocks. The Securities and Exchange Commission reported 41 bankruptcies following the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle, making it difficult to finance debt.\n\nYet, by the end of the year, the biotech sector started to recover. Over one year, BlackRock’s iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) is now up 10%, but down -1.3% year-to-date. Due to negative market sentiment, some biotech stocks are more discounted than others.\n\nBut which biotech stocks have sounder fundamentals?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) the CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCRISPR (NASDAQ:CRSP), which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats is a gene-editing tool adapted from bacterial defense to apply as molecular scissors.\n\nBy cutting DNA fragments at certain points, CRISPR tech can potentially correct faulty genes and eliminate conditions stemming from them. In January, the company announced the FDA approval of gene-edited cell therapy CASGEVY for treating patients who require regular blood transfusions to stay alive.\n\nFor 2024, CRISPR Therapeutics plans to advance clinical trials across oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders. In the full-year 2023 filing, the company reported $260.4 million in net cash used in operating activities compared to $495.7 million the year prior, attributed to Vertex payments.\n\nWhile the company’s total revenue remained relatively flat at ~$370 million, it had a $153.6 million net loss, a 76% decrease from the net loss in 2022. Overall, CRISPR Therapeutics will not need additional funding for the next two years. Twenty-eight Nasdaq analysts view CRSP’s average price target at $86.22 vs the current $71.61 per share.\n\nOwing to the wide development spectrum of gene-editing therapies, the high estimate for CRSP stock is $199, while the low forecast is $30 per share. Year-to-date, CRSP stock is up 8.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nModerna (MRNA) Mobile phone with logo of American pharmaceutical company Moderna Inc. (MRNA) on screen in front of website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is one of the biotech stocks that was tightly wound up during the C19 vaccines rollout. Within the last year, the aptly-named MRNA stock has been down 28% but only 6.3% year-to-date, suggesting a rally from the bottom. Although tied with Pfizer for the vaccine rollout, it is yet to be shown that government-granted immunity will be torn down.\n\nMuch is expected of Moderna’s cancer vaccines outside of respiratory infections, using the tweaked mRNA delivery for the immune response to fight cancer cells. In the last few decades, there has been a significantly higher uptick of cancer in adults younger than 50.\n\nLearning from the scaled-up response to C19 in 2021, Moderna will likely be a key player in this response, making it one of the biotech stocks to watch for. In the latest Q4 2023 filing, Moderna reported a net loss of $4.7 billion for the full year vs the $8.4 billion net income in 2022.\n\nYet, the company surprised investors in Q4 by reporting positive $0.55 earnings per share (EPS) vs expected negative $0.78. With the launch of RSV vaccines for the elderly and cancer mRNA deployment in the future, 21 analysts polled by Nasdaq place the average MRNA price target at $129.27 vs the current $105.\n\nThis is the case with all biotech stocks. The range for highs and lows is high owing to uncertain development and approvals. The high estimate for MRNA shares is $310, while the low estimate is $61 per share.\n\nBio-Techne (TECH) biotech stocks bio-techne\n\nBio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) broke even on a one-year timetable at -1.3% returns but is down -6.8% year-to-date similar to MRNA. The company is a global supplier of high-precision diagnostics, clinical products, reagents, and analytical instruments used throughout the biotech sector.\n\nIn other words, Bio-Techne is for the biotech stocks that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is for companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Last Friday, the company gained EU IVDR certification for its latest leukemia diagnostics. Previously, in 2022, Forbes listed Bio-Techne on the Best Employers for Diversity list, signaling compliance with the ESG framework.\n\nIn the latest Q2 FY24 earnings, Bio-Techne reported $272.6 million in net sales, with an organic revenue decline of 2% YoY. Of the last four quarters, the company beat EPS estimates only in Q2 ‘23. However, with an 18% increase in operations cash flow at $142.5 million, Bio-Techne is well positioned to carry the biotech revival.\n\nBased on 12 analyst insights pulled by Nasdaq, the average TECH price target is $81.5 vs the current $71.50. Because Bio-Techne is a stable biotech company, the high estimate is $95, while the low forecast is $65 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Brilliant \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "OK, I know what you're thinking.\n\nForget Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)? The company is the undisputed leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock since early last year. Furthermore, Nvidia generated triple-digit year-over-year growth for three successive quarters and is forecasting another one for the current quarter. I've been bullish on Nvidia for a long time.\n\nYou're absolutely right on every one of those counts. And no, I haven't changed my mind. I'm still as bullish on Nvidia as ever. Here's the thing: The stock is selling for 80 times earnings and 39 times sales, and despite its growth trajectory, some investors won't even consider a stock with a valuation of that magnitude, even if the forward multiples of 38 times earnings and 18 times sales are more favorable.\n\nFor investors who have absolutely no intention of buying Nvidia at this level, I offer two alternatives from among the other six stocks in the Magnificent Seven: of Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla.\n\nThese stocks still have significant upside but with more reasonable valuations. Furthermore, while Wall Street loves Nvidia, they love Amazon and Microsoft even more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven Buy No. 1: Amazon\n\nIt's easy to see why Wall Street has a soft spot for Amazon. The company revolutionized digital retail, turning a humble online bookstore into an e-commerce juggernaut. Amazon controlled roughly 38% of the e-commerce market last year, according to online data provider Statista. For context, that's more than the next 14 digital retailers combined. The improving economy will no doubt boost its fortunes over the coming year and beyond.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the undisputed leader in the cloud infrastructure space it pioneered, with 31% of the market, according to market analyst Canalys. In response to the accelerating demand for generative AI, Amazon beefed up its cloud offerings, providing the company with a compelling opportunity for future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet's not forget Amazon's digital advertising business. The company was already the third largest online advertiser, behind just Google and Meta Platforms -- and that was before Amazon added advertisements to its Prime Video that will surely boost its revenue.\n\nInvestors might be surprised to find that, of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon is the hands-down favorite among Wall Street analysts, not Nvidia. Of the 47 analysts who cover Amazon, 91% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommends selling. Only 55% rate Nvidia stock a buy, with the rest moving to hold or sell based on valuation concerns.\n\nWhen it comes to Amazon, Mizuho analyst James Lee is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has a buy rating and $230 price target on the stock, which suggests roughly 30% upside. The analyst cites improving revenue for AWS and operating efficiency gains for Amazon's e-commerce business as fueling his positive take.\n\nGiven the multiple drivers for future growth, it's easy to see why Amazon is a favorite among Wall Street analysts. Furthermore, at less than 3 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a bargain.\n\nMagnificent Seven Buy No. 2: Microsoft\n\nIt's not difficult to see the appeal of Microsoft. It's best known for its ubiquitous Windows operating system and its leading suite of business productivity software, Office, which provides the company with a strong foundation upon which to build its future.\n\nMicrosoft Azure is the No. 2 Cloud provider, with 26% of the market, and growth recently accelerated to 30% year over year in the most recent quarter, outpacing AWS and Google Cloud at 13% and 26%, respectively. Helping fuel those market share gains was the company's quick move into generative AI and its suite of AI-fueled digital assistants dubbed Copilot.\n\nThese moves increased demand for Azure. In its fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended Dec. 31, the company noted that 6 percentage points of its cloud growth was the result of growing demand for AI services.\n\nMicrosoft is also more highly rated on Wall Street than Nvidia. Of the 34 analysts who offered opinions in March, 79% rate the stock a buy or strong buy, also well ahead of the GPU specialist.\n\nAnalysts at Truist are Microsoft's biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street. They have a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $600, which represents 42% upside for investors. The analysts cite Microsoft's early implementation of generative AI and see additional demand for Azure and Copilot as driving future growth.\n\nMicrosoft's early moves in AI and strong legacy businesses help illustrate why the stock is preferred on Wall Street. Furthermore, at less than 36 times forward earnings, Microsoft is selling at a slight premium to the multiple of 28 for the S&P 500. However, given its robust growth and future prospects, Microsoft is deserving of its premium -- and it's still cheaper than Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's Blackwell Chip Is Here. How Will the Red-Hot \"Magnificent Seven\" Company's New GPU Affect the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Landscape?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent GPU Technology Conference (GTC) took the wraps off Blackwell -- the company's next-generation chip platform. Named after mathematician, statistician, and pioneering game theorist David Blackwell, the new graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware is designed to deliver unprecedented processing power for generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nMade possible by a roughly $10 billion research and development budget, the first GB200 Blackwell processors are expected to deliver a major leap forward compared to the company's existing Hopper H100 GPUs. Nvidia expects to begin shipping the first generation of Blackwell chips later this year. A single GB200 GPU is expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000, and CEO Jensen Huang believes the new processor will quickly become the most successful product in the company's history.\n\nWhat does the upcoming release of Blackwell mean for Nvidia's stock? And how will this incredibly powerful new GPU reshape the AI landscape? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia gears up to build an unbeatable AI ecosystem\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $2.4 trillion, Nvidia now ranks as the third-most valuable of the Magnificent Seven companies. The AI leader's stock soared 259% over the last year as skyrocketing demand for its GPUs powered incredible sales and earnings growth. Now, the company has a new processor on the horizon that looks poised to deliver incredible tech breakthroughs.\n\nNvidia's GB200 is expected to be roughly four times as fast as its H100 GPUs, which are currently top of the line and favored for powering today's most advanced AI applications. Given the dramatic performance improvements delivered by the first generation of Blackwell chips, it's reasonable to expect that these new processors will pave the way for dramatic new advancements in AI technologies.\n\nNvidia already said that Blackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud-services provider. It's also seeing strong demand from AI-focused companies, telecom providers, and a range of other technology businesses. Heralding the arrival of what looks to be another breakthrough moment for artificial intelligence, Blackwell's unveiling was paired with endorsements from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and other high-profile tech leaders and luminaries.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut crucially, Blackwell is part of a much larger ecosystem strategy. Check out this quote from Nvidia's Jensen Huang:\n\nBlackwell is both a chip at the heart of the system, but it's really a platform. It's basically a computer system. What Nvidia does for a living is not build the chip. We build an entire supercomputer, from the chip to the system to the interconnects, the NVLinks, the networking, but very importantly the software.\n\nNvidia will also be using its next-generation GPUs to advance its position and ambitions in the software space. Leading AI developers already rely on Nvidia's CUDA software to create applications that are powered by the company's processors, and the appeal of the high-performance Blackwell processors should help ensure that customers continue to use its software.\n\nThe strategy extends even further. During a meeting at GTC, Huang had this to say: \"You can build chips to make software run better, but you can't create a new market without software. What makes us unique is that we're the only chip company I believe that will create its own market.\"\n\nWith the release of the GB200, Nvidia appears to be on track to open the door for the creation of new categories of AI software applications. In turn, the launch, scaling, and continued evolution of such software could create even more demand for its ultrahigh-end GPUs.\n\nAn alliance is forming to challenge Nvidia's AI dominance\n\nReuters reported on March 25 that companies including Alphabet, Qualcomm, and Intel are teaming up to create an organization aimed at stopping Nvidia from establishing an unassailably dominant position in AI. The group's UXL Foundation is aiming to create a software suite that will help run AI applications on a wider range of processors and reduce reliance on Nvidia's platforms.\n\nAccording to the report, the UXL Foundation is now looking to recruit Microsoft, Amazon, and other influential technology players. So while many of the biggest names in tech are excited about Blackwell's capabilities, there's understandably resistance to the broader AI space becoming overly reliant on Nvidia's ecosystem.\n\nTo some extent, the formation of the UXL Foundation speaks to just how strong Nvidia's competitive positioning is right now. The company commands roughly 90% of the market for the kinds of GPUs used for AI and other accelerated computing applications, and the launch of Blackwell will likely help it maintain or even expand its dominance. Paired with an expanding array of purpose-tailored software tools, Nvidia is on track to reshape the AI landscape -- and its competitors and potential rivals have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Is Down 12% From Its All-Time Highs. Time to Buy?",
        "content": "It's hard to proclaim any stock other than Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) as the stock of 2024 (so far). It has been an unbelievable investment and has gained more than 267% so far this year. However, the stock is cooling a bit, as that number used to be as high as 318%.\n\nSo, with Super Micro Computer sitting around 15% off from its all-time high, is now a second opportunity to hop into the stock?\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a leader in server design\n\nSuper Micro Computer is an investor's second chance at buying Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the stock that ruled 2023. While Nvidia sells the GPUs that make up data centers that can be used to create powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models, many companies don't have the expertise to assemble their own data centers to get the most use out of them.\n\nInstead, they turn to companies like Supermicro that specialize in server design. With Supermicro's expertise, customers can highly customize their server to meet any workload size or specialization, be it drug discovery, AI model training, or engineering simulations.\n\nBecause Supermicro is essentially one order down the value chain, it didn't see the benefits from growing AI demand until now. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Sept. 30, 2023), its revenue rose 14% year over year to $2.12 billion. But in Q2 (ending Dec. 31), its revenue rocketed 103% higher to $3.67 billion, confirming investors' suspicions that Super Micro Computer was slated for massive revenue growth due to AI demand.\n\nAlongside that massive quarter was a huge bump to its annual revenue forecast. In Q1, management's fiscal 2024 revenue guidance was $10 billion to $11 billion. However, thanks to strong Q2 results and impressive demand, management raised its 2024 guidance, forecasting $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion.\n\nThis massive guidance increase excited many investors and ignited Super Micro Computer's run-up.\n\nBut is it worth buying at its current price, even with the pullback?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock still trades at a hefty premium\n\nWhen a company rises that much, it's safe to assume the stock has gotten a bit expensive. While that's true, there's also another part to the story. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nSupermicro entered the year trading around 13 times forward earnings. The market should have known great quarters were coming due to its industry, so the first 100% return was essentially getting Supermicro to where it should have been trading all along.\n\nHowever, its current price tag of 45 times forward earnings seems a bit steep, especially when Nvidia is currently trading for 38 times forward earnings and has never traded for more than 51 times throughout the massive AI-fueled run-up.\n\nSupermicro also has much more competition than Nvidia, as it faces companies like Hewlett-Packard and IBM in the server business. In contrast, Nvidia essentially had the best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI.\n\nAs a result, I can't recommend Supermicro at this price. The company will likely continue to do well throughout this year, as it's slated to post strong growth thanks to server demand. But, the stock has already priced in massive success, making it difficult to grow meaningfully.\n\nIf you bought Super Micro Computer stock based on my Jan. 10 recommendation, congratulations -- you're up around 205%. But I think now is the time to take gains and move on, as there are plenty of other options in the market that will be easier to make money on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Is there any reason to mess around with investing? To take a flyer on a no-name stock? To gamble with your next egg? Or is it better to put your hard-earned money into top-rated stocks to buy?\n\nCount me in for the latter.\n\nGranted, there’s nothing wrong with investing a little money in a speculative choice. But if you’re serious about making money and investing your dollars in choices that give you the best opportunity to beat the market, you can’t do better than top-rated stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe rating system we’ll use is the Portfolio Grader, which makes identifying top-rated stocks to buy pretty easy. The Portfolio Grader evaluates every stock in the market based on momentum, earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and other factors. Top-rated stocks to buy get “A” ratings, which is what you’ll see on this list.\n\nAnd if you find a stock in your portfolio with a “D” or “F” grade, it’s time to sell it and pick up one of these top-rated stocks to buy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the king of top-rated stocks to buy for a year now. And why not? The semiconductor company makes most graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the most advanced artificial intelligence applications in the world.\n\nNVDA stock grew by 239% in 2023 as its valuation jumped to more than $2 trillion, making it the world’s third-most valuable publicly traded company. Revenues also jumped, from $26 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024. Earnings per share jumped from $1.74 to $11.93.\n\nAnd there’s plenty more to come. Even though other semiconductor companies are making inroads to compete with Nvidia’s chips, NVDA has a huge head start. And it now has tons of cash to help it maintain its advantage through research and development, expansion or acquisitions.\n\nOn top of that, the AI chip market will only grow, with projections coming in at a market value of $119.4 billion by 2027 — a 123.4% increase from 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock will continue to be a winner and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a technology company that’s long used AI to help it land government contracts.\n\nIt contracts with military and intelligence agencies to provide real-time data analysis that helps soldiers in the field and officers in the Pentagon to do their jobs.\n\nBut Palantir is also building out its commercial side. Revenue from commercial clients grew by 32% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, reaching $284 million.\n\nBy contrast, Palantir’s signature military revenue was $324 million but grew only 5%. The number will improve, especially since Palantir won a $178.4 million Army contract. It will build a system to provide the Army with deep-sensing capability enabled by AI and machine learning.\n\nPalantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform, or AIP, can be used for both defense and commercial clients. That bodes well for future growth.\n\nPLTR stock is up 44% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has grown so much that it makes Nvidia look like an underperforming company if that’s possible. SMCI stock is up 260% so far this year and 824% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe driving force behind Supermicro’s growth is tied to Nvidia and other companies that are working with AI. Super Micro develops storage and server solutions that can be custom-built for its clients. Its products are ideal for pairing the massive number of GPUs needed to run advanced AI and generative AI applications.\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $3.66 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year ago. Income of $295.9 million and $5.47 per share was a sharp increase from a year ago, when Supermicro brought in $176.1 million in revenue and $3.31 per share.\n\nSMCI stock is a great way to invest in AI while diversifying away from chipmakers. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a great comeback story. The owner of Facebook and Instagram saw its stock drop sharply in 2022 as it invested billions of dollars into CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse. That spending coincided with a drop in advertising that rocked META stock.\n\nBut over the last 12 months, Zuckerburg’s company turned its fortunes around. Meta began refocusing on growth and the bottom line, reducing head count and expenses while investing more in the core business. It launched its Threads app as a direct rival to X, the company formerly known as Twitter.\n\nAnd engagement grew as Meta counted 3.98 billion monthly users on its apps in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 6% from a year ago. Revenue also climbed by 25% in the last year, reaching $40.1 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nMeta is also heavily investing in AI, which it will use for public-facing features and to make its advertising more effective. It recently unveiled two new GPU clusters that Meta says are “a port of our larger road map for the future of AI.”\n\nMETA stock is up 40% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a top play in the retail sector. The Arkansas company is the biggest retail company in the world.\n\nWMT continues to see strong growth as it dominates both the grocery and the home goods sector with its ubiquitous supercenters.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter was $173.4 million, up 5.7% from a year ago. The jump was thanks to a 4% increase in sales driven by increased customer traffic.\n\nWalmart recorded $648.1 billion in revenue for the full year, up 6% from 2022. Income of $6.6 billion was a 32.2% increase from a year ago.\n\nWalmart remains popular because of its size and footprint. It has more than 10,800 locations. By its sheer size, Walmart can squeeze suppliers to get exclusive or reduced pricing that it can pass on to its customers to beat competitors.\n\nWalmart’s e-commerce sales also grew by 23% in 2023, reaching more than $100 billion for the year.\n\nWMT stock is up 15% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDorian LPG (LPG) Ship tanker gas LPG, Aerial view Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) tanker, Tanker ship logistic and transportation business oil and gas industry, Loading arm oil and gas offshore platforms.\n\nSource: Avigator Fortuner / Shutterstock.com\n\nDorian LPG (NYSE:LPG) isn’t as flashy as some of the other names on this list. But there’s nothing wrong with investing in the energy sector — particularly when you’re finding top-rated stocks to buy such as LPG.\n\nDorian LPG is a liquified petroleum gas shipping company that operates 26 modern very large gas carriers, or VLGCs, with a capacity of 2.1 million cubic meters.\n\nDorian’s ships move liquified petroleum around the world, taking to suppliers who in turn sell to customers who operate portable heaters, gas ovens, barbecue grills and gas fireplaces.\n\nDorian reported a time charter equivalent rate of $76,337 per operating day in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), which helped it earn revenues of $163.1 million. That was up from $103.3 million in the same period a year ago.\n\nLPG also offers an oversized dividend yield of 10.8%. The stock has increased 83% in the last 12 months and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) makes laptop and desktop computers, notebooks, and mobile devices. But the company also has ambitious AI plans, including a generative AI platform that helps its customers generate better predictions and analyze data.\n\nOrders for the company’s AI-optimized servers increased by 40% in the fourth quarter. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke says customers demand personal computers and servers with AI capabilities. “We have positioned ourselves well in AI,” he told analysts.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Feb. 2, 2024) was $22.3 billion, down 11% from a year ago. But analysts and investors are clearly betting that DELL will turn those numbers around this calendar year.\n\nDELL stock is up 200% in the last 12 months and 49% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, SMCI and LNG.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Thinks Nvidia Could End Up Like Cisco After the Dot-Com Crash. Here's the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That I'm More Worried About.",
        "content": "One of the most outspoken investors on Wall Street is Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest. Wood is best known for making big bets in emerging areas of technology and healthcare.\n\nIn a shareholder letter published earlier this month, she suggested that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) could end up like Cisco in the aftermath of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s.\n\nGiven the meteoric rise in Nvidia's stock price over the last year, it's reasonable to believe a pullback could be on the horizon. But calling for a crash akin to Cisco? That seems dramatic.\n\nInstead, I think a different \"Magnificent Seven\" stock could be at risk of falling out of favor with investors. Let's dig into why I see Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as much more likely to follow in Cisco's footsteps.\n\nSolving latent needs\n\nLatent needs are an interesting concept. Simply put, a latent need is a problem that people don't even realize they have.\n\nApple is the king of solving latent needs. With the iPod, iMac, iPhone, iPad, and AirPods, the company revolutionized personal computing, communications, and entertainment in ways that people didn't even realize were needed.\n\nThe company's long list of innovative hardware made it one of the most recognized brands around the world. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe artificial intelligence race is on\n\nAs investors salivate over all things related to artificial intelligence (AI), Apple is yet again remaining tight-lipped about its plans. I don't think this is the best move after some of the company's flops in recent history.\n\nGiven how quiet the company has been on the innovation front, I think overcommunicating might be an appropriate strategy right now. Sure, it just shipped its virtual reality (VR) headset, the Vision Pro. But for now, I think people are more intrigued by the idea of VR, rather than the actual use of the technology in their daily lives.\n\nAfter years of playing coy, news broke earlier this month that the company was abandoning its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. And big tech cohorts Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft all dominate cloud computing -- a movement that Apple missed entirely.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple only recently made headlines in the AI realm following its acquisition of a start-up called DarwinAI. While this deal was interesting, details surrounding how it plans to leverage DarwinAI are sparse.\n\nBy contrast, Nvidia is aggressively entering new AI markets that it can disrupt. For example, the company is an investor in humanoid robotics start-up Figure AI, as well as a partner with enterprise software platform Databricks.\n\nAmong mega-cap tech companies, Nvidia is emerging as the front-runner in AI. Demand is soaring for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia's revenue increased 126% year over year, while profits and free cash flow grew nearly sixfold. On the other hand, Apple's revenue has been in decline for a year as demand for luxury hardware devices has stalled against the backdrop of a tough economy.\n\nThe innovator's dilemma\n\nCisco is one of the most interesting case studies in recent business history. The company was hailed as a leading innovator during the early stages of the internet age. But after competitors began producing similar products, Cisco failed to pivot and move on. Given Nvidia's broad reach across the AI spectrum, I find Wood's comparison to Cisco lacking.\n\nSure, like Cisco back in the late 1990s, Nvidia stock soared to unprecedented levels. But I think the company's momentum is just getting started. The long-term narrative surrounding AI is encouraging, and right now the chipmaker appears to be the engine powering all sorts of applications.\n\nBy contrast, Apple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 -- higher than both Meta Platforms and Alphabet as of the time of this writing. It's tough to justify this premium when the company appears to be at a crossroads. It isn't growing, demand for its products is in decline, it abandoned EV's, and it doesn't appear to have any tangible strategy related to AI.\n\nCould competition ultimately pose a threat to Nvidia? It probably will. But this is why I find the company's investments in robotics and software to be savvy moves. It is clearly exploring markets beyond its core chip business, which will hopefully prove fruitful in the long run.\n\nGiven the amount of unknowns surrounding Apple, I see the company as an enigma right now. As an investor, I'm not concerned about Nvidia's prospects. But given the lack of innovation from Apple for several years, I think there is a real possibility the company could end up in a situation similar to that of Cisco at some point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "GRAPHIC-How the US stock market rocketed through the first quarter",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is off to a soaring start in 2024, as optimism over the economy and interest rate cuts has combined with exuberance about the business opportunity in artificial intelligence to stir up a potent cocktail for equities.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 has gained 10% so far this year with one trading day left in the first quarter, building on a surge that started at the end of 2023. The S&P 500 in late January hit its first record high in two years and hasn't looked back, setting more than a dozen highs without a significant pullback so far this year, on pace for its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite in late February also registered its first record high since November 2021.\n\nKey to this year's gains has been confidence from investors that the economy is set for a \"soft landing\", in which inflation moderates but the economy avoids a severe downturn.\n\nSixty-two percent of fund managers saw a soft landing as the most likely outcome for the economy in the next 12 months, while only 11% projected a \"hard landing\", according to BofA Global Research's latest monthly survey published earlier in March.\n\nA dovish Federal Reserve meeting earlier this month, in which the central bank kept its view of three interest rate cuts this year while upgrading its economic outlook, has also encouraged many investors.\n\nStocks have been able to defy a rise in Treasury yields, after rising yields were a pressure point for equities in 2023. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was last around 4.2%, up from 3.86% at the end of last year.\n\n\"As Q2 kicks off, we still see a more supportive near-term backdrop for risk-taking....,\" strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute, which is overweight U.S. stocks, said in a note this week. \"We think upbeat risk appetite can broaden out beyond tech as more sectors adopt AI, and as market confidence is buoyed by recent Fed messaging and broadly falling inflation.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch optimism has helped drive up stock valuations. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has climbed to about 21, its highest level in more than two years, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nThe stock market continues to be propelled by some of the megacap companies that led the way in 2023.\n\nBut after all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech and growth stocks posted huge gains in 2023, this year has seen them go separate ways.\n\nNvidia continues to shine, surging over 80% so far this year fueled by its gold-standard chips for AI. Meta Platforms is another big winner on the year, jumping about 40% with the Facebook parent issuing its first dividend in February.\n\nOther megacaps have not fared so well. Apple shares have slipped 10%, with the iPhone maker hurt by pressure on its China business and from antitrust regulators. Tesla has tumbled about 28%, hit by worries about electric vehicle demand.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven were responsible for 40% of the S&P 500’s year-to-date gain as of late last week, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That compares with a share of over 60% last year for the megacap group.\n\nOther stocks have helped pick up the slack this year, indicating the rally is broadening.\n\nTech and communication services -- two sectors that house a combined five of the Magnificent Seven -- are the top S&P 500 sectors so far this year. But energy , financials and industrials are also outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nRecent performance is \"providing early signs that investors are beginning to look for opportunities outside Big Tech and in anticipation of lower interest rates later this year,\" Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said in a market comment on Monday.\n\nInvestors have also been fixated to start the year on which companies stand to benefit from increasing use of AI.\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for AI enthusiasm, but a clutch of chipmakers and other tech stocks have also registered massive gains, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings. In the latest sign of AI fervor, shares of chip firm Astera Labs have more than doubled since their initial public offering a week ago.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Megan Davies and Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on top of the world over the last year as it has cornered the market on artificial intelligence (AI) chips, with its stock up more than 247% since last March.\n\nAs demand for AI services soared, so has the need for graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary for training and running AI models. Meanwhile, Nvidia has held a leading market share in GPUs for years, perfectly positioning it to immediately begin supplying its chips to AI developers everywhere.\n\nConsequently, Nvidia's earnings have skyrocketed as it achieved a majority market share in the AI GPU market while competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have scrambled to catch up.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations, rising 20% in the last month alone. Given the massive potential of AI and Nvidia's position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.\n\nSo, here are two reasons to buy Nvidia stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Getting a head start in artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 reignited interest in AI and highlighted just how far the technology had come. Companies from countless industries began pivoting their businesses toward the budding arena as it became clear that AI could bolster a wide variety of businesses, from consumer tech to autonomous vehicles, e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\n\nData from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit close to $200 billion last year and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. For reference, that projection would see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade. As a result, there seems to be no end in sight to the soaring demand for AI GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, last year, Nvidia's head start in the market saw it achieve an estimated 90% market share in AI chips, leading to soaring earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed the company further ahead, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy.\n\n2. Nvidia's stock is trading at its best value in months\n\nLast year, Nvidia became the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $1 trillion. In fact, its market cap is currently more than $2 trillion, with Nvidia the world's third most valuable company, only after Microsoft and Apple.\n\nNvidia has come a long way in a short time. Yet its stock has actually increased in value over the last 12 months. NVDA Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThe chart above shows that Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months.\n\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nThis, in addition to Nvidia's potent position in a burgeoning industry and significant cash reserves, makes the company's stock worth considering right now for a long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 25, 2024\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "title": "Alphabet and Amazon Stocks Surge to All-Time Highs: Buy These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stars Now or Regret It Later",
        "content": "The inflation panic took the wind out of Wall Street's sails, especially where it crosses Silicon Valley in a proverbial sense. The stocks of tech titans Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) took a beating as investors backed away from growth-oriented ideas.\n\nAmazon's shares fell as much as 57% from its pre-panic record price. The Google parent's price drop stopped at 46%. Only now, more than two years later, are they sniffing at fresh all-time highs again.\n\nI don't think this is the last hurrah from two tired comeback stories. Instead, I see Alphabet and Amazon as the two best buys in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group right now, with tremendous returns on the long-term horizon. You should consider grabbing some of these top-quality stocks while they're still relatively affordable.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet's big AI bets\n\nFirst, I'd like to point out that Amazon and Alphabet have plenty of irons in the artificial intelligence (AI) fires. They may not be as deeply and directly involved in the frenzy for generative AI and large language models (LLMs) as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), but you're looking at two of the leading providers of cloud-based computing services.\n\nGoogle Cloud and Amazon Web Services play significant roles in the back-end of everyone else's AI ambitions, crunching the required numbers in their global data center networks. They also offer their own AI tools, led by the ChatGPT-like Google Gemini platform and the Amazon Lex chatbot. You may not be familiar with Lex, but it's basically the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa, made available for any developer in need of a conversationsl natural language system. How committed to AI innovation are Google and Amazon? Well, both companies use the latest and greatest AI acceleration hardware from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), but that's not all. The Cloud TPU and AWS Inferentia chips are proprietary AI accelerator chips designed by Google's and Amazon's own engineers, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd they are heavy users of AI tools in their daily work, too. You'll find AI behind the scenes of many consumer-facing services, from travel routes in Google Maps and Amazon's automated warehouse management to YouTube's video recommendation engine and Alexa's helpful chatter.\n\nThese stocks aren't expensive, even at all-time highs\n\nSo I'm not saying that Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks should have tripled over the last year, like Nvidia. But their rebound from the rock-bottom pricing of the inflation crisis was slower than they deserved. I can't believe it took this long just to get back to prices last seen in November 2021.\n\nAnd they're priced to keep on moving, too.\n\nShares of Amazon are changing hands at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.2 times sales. Alphabet's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) clocks in at 6.1. In a world where Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) commands a double-digit P/S ratio and Nvidia has soared to 39 times sales, these figures strike me as big market-maker mistakes.\n\nWhy Amazon and Alphabet aren't skyrocketing (yet)\n\nOf course, Wall Street had its reasons to keep Alphabet and Amazon under wraps while most of their \"Magnificent Seven\" peers soared.\n\nThe digital advertising market fell into a deep recession in 2022. Inflationary pressure is no joke -- consumers held on to their wallets with both hands while everybody's cost of doing business rose. That's not a great environment for launching extravagant marketing campaigns. The economic pressure has subsided in recent quarters but I'm still not talking about a full-fledged return to optimal health. So Alphabet's ad-based business has seen slower growth than usual, and the stock arguably deserves a bit of a discount under these circumstances.\n\nThe same market reality also held back Amazon's retail sales. The inflation crunch started knee-deep in the all-important holiday season of 2021. The e-commerce veteran had to cut costs, slow down its spending on the delivery infrastructure, and absorb two years of low-grade growth. Again, I see why risk-averse investors would stay away from Amazon against that backdrop.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet should soar soon enough\n\nAmazon and Alphabet, with their undaunted investments in AI and cloud computing, are not just surviving the storm but blazing their own paths through it.\n\nThe key takeaway? Investors should try to tune out the market noise and focus on the fundamentals. These tech giants look undervalued today, but that doesn't mean you should consider selling your shares to find better alternatives. On the contrary, the modest pricing is an open invitation to grab fistfuls of Alphabet and Amazon shares at a reasonable price.\n\nIn the end, no downturn lasts forever. This pair of \"Magnificent Seven\" beasts is prepared to truly soar when the American and global economy gets back on its feet.\n\nThe companies that drive tomorrow's innovations will deliver the most enduring returns. That's what Amazon and Alphabet do, and I can't wait to see how they will fare in the current bull market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence benchmarking group MLCommons on Wednesday released a fresh set of tests and results that rate the speed at which top-of-the-line hardware can run AI applications and respond to users.\n\nThe two new benchmarks added by MLCommons measure the speed at which the AI chips and systems can generate responses from the powerful AI models packed with data. The results roughly demonstrate to how quickly an AI application such as ChatGPT can deliver a response to a user query.\n\nOne of the new benchmarks added the capability to measure the speediness of a question-and-answer scenario for large language models. Called Llama 2, it includes 70 billion parameters and was developed by Meta Platforms.\n\nMLCommons officials also added a second text-to-image generator to the suite of benchmarking tools, called MLPerf, based on Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL model.\n\nServers powered by Nvidia's H100 chips built by the likes of Alphabet's Google, Supermicro and Nvidia itself handily won both new benchmarks on raw performance. Several server builders submitted designs based on the company's less powerful L40S chip.\n\nServer builder Krai submitted a design for the image generation benchmark with a Qualcomm AI chip that draws significant less power than Nvidia's cutting edge processors.\n\nIntel also submitted a design based on its Gaudi2 accelerator chips. The company described the results as \"solid.\"\n\nRaw performance is not the only measure that is critical when deploying AI applications. Advanced AI chips suck up enormous amounts of energy and one of the most significant challenges for AI companies is deploying chip that deliver an optimal amount of performance for a minimal amount of energy.\n\nMLCommons has a separate benchmark category for measuring power consumption.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Rising to the Challenge: This Aspiring \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock is the One to Watch in 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been setting the standard for market-defining growth investments for more than a year now. Led by Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the designer of specialized chips for accelerated processing of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, these seven megacaps have gained an average of 85% in 52 weeks.\n\nBut stock groupings like the \"Magnificent Seven\" are always subject to change. Some of the current members aren't pulling their weight and could be up for replacement someday soon. Apple is only up by 10% over the same period, while Tesla actually fell 11% lower.\n\nAt the same time, a handful of stocks are bubbling up from below. In particular, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) looks ready to take Apple's or Tesla's spot in the \"Magnificent Seven\" society fairly soon.\n\nHere's why I think AMD belongs in the \"Magnificent Seven\" discussion in 2024.\n\nThe shifting sands of AI supremacy\n\nNvidia may look like the undisputed ruler of the AI-chip hill so far, but the company's position is far from guaranteed.\n\nFor example, some of the world's largest and most powerful supercomputers are hard at work training the next generation of eye-opening AI systems. Nvidia's A100 or H100 accelerators are found in five of the 10 beefiest supercomputers nowadays.\n\nAt the same time, AMD's Instinct MI250X accelerator chips power two systems on that top-10 list -- including the dominant performer. In other words, system builders chasing extreme performance aren't strictly limited to Nvidia solutions.\n\nBoth companies are rolling out new generations of their AI accelerator lines right now; you should see their names in the next few versions of the elite-level supercomputer rankings. So far, performance benchmarks for the H200 and Instinct MI300X accelerators are limited to tests performed by Nvidia and AMD themselves, and the companies criticize each other for handpicking favorable benchmarks or parameters. Nothing new under the sun, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's fair to say that AMD offers comparable raw performance, which can turn into a massive advantage if its pricing is significantly lower. And then you have to consider the power requirements of each solution. Anyone can win performance comparisons by throwing more hardware at the problem, but the AI-building users of these muscular systems may pick hardware based on expected electric bills, cooling systems, and other real-world practicalities.\n\nAnd AMD has a history of putting up a good fight on those terms. I can't wait to see the actual wattage measurements for Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI300X accelerators.\n\nAMD's spirited bid for AI accelerator leadership\n\nSo AMD isn't sitting on its hands, letting Nvidia snag every AI-training system contract without a fight. AMD's current solutions come with more and faster memory while Nvidia's generally claim the raw number-crunching crown, but you can find realistic use cases for either one. And again, I'm looking forward to the next round of AI accelerator upgrades finding end-market customers in 2024.\n\nIn all fairness, AMD is more than a few steps behind at the moment. The company recorded a bit more than $400 million in data center graphics processing unit (GPU) sales in the fourth quarter of 2023. Nvidia doesn't specifically break out its AI accelerator sales in financial reports, but the company's overall data center revenues quintupled to $18.4 billion in the same reporting period.\n\nSo AMD has some catching up to do, but the company wields a mighty AI accelerator design and relies on the same third-party manufacturing solutions as Nvidia. If the balance of AI power shifts away from Nvidia and toward AMD this year, people might start including the runner-up AI chip expert instead of Tesla in their \"Magnificent Seven\" discussions.\n\nThis dashing challenge from AMD is the main reason I'm not buying Nvidia stock right now. Instead, I recently cashed in some Nvidia profits and reinvested it in an undervalued growth stock instead. AMD's stock is also a little rich for my blood right now, but the company is a serious challenger to Nvidia's AI supremacy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

Nearly half the stocks on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index have jumped at least 10% already this year, pushing the gauge’s price to sales ratio to its highest level in at least two decades.\n\n“The trick is recognizing who’s really monetizing” artificial intelligence, said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management LLC.\n\nRead more: Micron Sees Biggest Rally Since 2011 After AI Boosts Outlook\n\nThe gains underscore a trend that’s been brewing in the AI space, as investors seek out stocks that can possibly replicate the eyepopping returns of Nvidia — which remains the only game in town when it comes to the market for processors that power AI workloads.\n\nBut many other components are involved, including memory chips, servers and networking components. Not to mention the equipment used to manufacture the chips themselves.\n\n“It’s getting more competitive,” said Brian Mulberry, a client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc. “There’s other ways that you can access the excitement and energy in the sector.”\n\nMicron shares are up by about 30% in the last month, outpacing Nvidia Corp.’s 17% gain. The memory chipmaker has been on a tear since reporting earnings that included a strong sales forecast signaling high demand for AI software.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell jumped to a record high in early March after demand for its information technology equipment used in AI work drove sales and profit above Wall Street expectations.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, a maker of servers, is up 18% this month after it was added to the S&P 500 Index. The company, which reports earnings May 2, will have to live up to expectations that it’s grown revenue more than 200% in the quarter to keep its rally going.\n\nStill, while the rally has broadened, some chipmakers attempting to catch up with Nvidia such as Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have been under additional pressure as they continue to lag the industry leader. Broadcom slumped earlier in March after earnings disappointed, while AMD’s revenue forecast in January was downbeat. It has recently been weighed down by a report that China will limit use of its chips.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Traders Find Reasons to Worry Beyond Sky-High Stock Price\n\nAnd with Nvidia still facing sky-high expectations, for some bulls it may be time to identify the next big winner in the AI wave.\n\n“There’s every reason to continue to believe that Nvidia will go higher, but it’s not going to have another 100% return form here,” said Mulberry. “Looking ahead three years, they might actually get a better return on investment.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nShares in video game retailer Gamestop Corp. were poised for the biggest decline in nine months after one of the original meme stocks reported a plunge in revenue. The drop comes after the stock benefited from a run-up on hopes the Federal Reserve would likely cut interest rates this year.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nIt’s taken about 25 years, but Silicon Valley finally feels like the old-school Silicon Valley again. Apple Inc. plans to kick off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10, when the company is expected to unveil its long-anticipated artificial intelligence strategy. Meta Platforms Inc. policy chief Nick Clegg warned US government officials that limiting companies from sharing certain artificial intelligence technologies publicly could harm American influence over the relatively new and evolving global AI industry. Dell cut 13,000 employees over the last fiscal year, a steeper reduction in headcount than initially announced. The crypto sector suffered one of its biggest security incidents this year after a hacker swiped $63 million from a blockchain-based game. As many as 8 million UK workers are at risk of losing their jobs to artificial intelligence with current government policy, the Institute for Public Policy Research warned.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nBraze Sprinklr Verint Vnet Group\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Hong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn’t Classified Tesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue In a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are Thriving\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best momentum ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on momentum investing and the stock market outlook, head over to 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\n\nWhat is Momentum Investing?\n\nMomentum investing refers to a strategy that increases portfolio exposure to stocks with robust performance while lowering exposure to those with weaker performance. This approach revolves around buying stocks with upward-trending prices and it has been historically backed by economic theory and empirical evidence. Typically targeting a 12-month timeframe, momentum strategies consistently record positive returns and add diversity to investment portfolios. According to BlackRock, the concept of momentum can be best grasped through behavioral finance theories. It stems from investors' behavioral tendencies, where individual actions reinforce market trends. Moreover, momentum rewards may offset the risk of short-term underperformance that some investors avoid. Despite occasional short-term setbacks, like those seen in 2001, 2009, and 2023, momentum consistently offers lasting benefits. Both risk-based and behavioral-based explanations play a role in its persistence, supporting the belief that momentum will remain a viable strategy in the future.\n\nMomentum Gaining Momentum\n\nThe renewed interest in Bitcoin and the stock market suggests that there might be a big bubble forming. While gold's record contradicts this notion to some extent, hinting at genuine caution driven by concerns over unsustainable fiscal spending, signs of things getting too heated are still there. According to a recent Bloomberg report, when looking closely at how stocks in the S&P 500 index are moving, there is a similar pattern to what happened during the big bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s. People are doing really well by purchasing stocks that have been doing well lately and investing in companies with growing earnings, putting momentum trading and growth investing in the spotlight. These strategies have been doing better than value investing. The current market rally seems to follow these patterns, especially with momentum trading making a strong comeback. Notably, the emergence of the Magnificent Seven as the prevailing investing theme in early 2023 led to a challenging period for momentum trading. However, the current situation differs, with momentum gaining momentum once again.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January 2024, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders participated in CNBC’s“Last Call” to discuss the markets. Sonders noted that when benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Dow hit record highs, it drives the momentum higher – at least for a while when the market ignores earnings and market fundamentals, focusing on performance only. Similarly, Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, joinedCNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on March 8, 2024. Siegel talked about momentum investing trending these days, but he also said that in his experience, trending stocks might see a slump of a few days before getting back on an upwards trajectory. However, by then, most momentum investors have already pulled out of their holdings. The investors then quickly hop onto the trades they just sold to reap the benefits of the ongoing market rally. He noted that individuals need ‘nerves of steel’ for momentum investing. Siegel observed that momentum followers usually do not care about a company’s valuation, its management, or its operational efficiency. They just look at current performance charts and jump on, leading select companies to skyrocket, sometimes even without proper fundamentals supporting the growth. Siegel stated that momentum investors believe in ‘making the trend your friend’ and they are confident that they can ‘jump off the train before it falls off the cliff’.\n\nHowever, on March 26, 2024, Liz Young, SoFi head of investment strategy, appeared on 'Closing Bell' and said that momentum in equities is fading. Breaking down her statement, she highlighted that from October to December 2023, momentum and high beta led the markets. Heading into 2024, momentum was still leading but slightly slowing down, with investor focus shifting to low volatility and quality stocks. Young observed that in March, low volatility, quality, value, and dividends are leading the rally. In terms of the momentum behind the market rally itself, Young commented that the velocity and fervor is fading but the rally is not about to be over entirely. There is room for stocks to continue skyrocketing. Although, the rebalance at the end of Q1 2024 could pose a risk to momentum followers.\n\nSome of the top momentum stocks to buy include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, we discuss the best momentum ETFs in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best momentum ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of March 26, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy\n\nA view of the hustle and bustle of trading activity on a busy trading floor.\n\nBest Momentum ETFs To Buy\n\n10. Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 74.06%\n\nInvesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) is based on the Dorsey Wright Technical Leaders Index, comprising about 100 US companies from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. It utilizes a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC to select firms showing strong relative strength characteristics. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP) expense ratio came in at 0.62%. The fund was launched on March 1, 2007. It ranks 10th on our list of the best momentum ETFs.\n\nO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the top holdings of Invesco Dorsey Wright Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:PDP). It is a retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. On February 7, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $9.26, beating market estimates by $0.05, and a revenue of $3.83 billion, missing Street consensus by $30 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY), compared to 45 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of the best momentum stocks to invest in.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) was also a bottom contributor to portfolio performance. The Company reported +11% sales growth for the quarter, driven by a +17% increase in sales to professional service providers, leading to +12% growth in operating income and +17% increase in earnings per share. The Company – true to its long capital allocation culture – has aggressively bought back shares over the past 12 months. O’Reilly Automotive’s professional sales segment continues to dramatically outpace its publicly traded competitors. The Company has a mostly singular focus on the United States, whereas several of its competitors have diverted their attention away from the large and fragmented U.S. professional market, toward non-U.S. or non-automotive markets. In the short-term, investors are focused on the mild weather that has unfolded during the late fall and early winter of 2023. Mild weather often leads to temporary slowdowns in sales growth for auto parts, but we would look to take advantage of that because O’Reilly’s long-term competitive positioning and extraordinary returns on capital are well-entrenched.”\n\n9. Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 76.65%\n\nInvesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS) tracks the Dorsey Wright SmallCap Technical Leaders Index, which selects approximately 200 companies based on their market performance and relative strength characteristics according to a proprietary methodology by Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC. These companies are chosen from the NASDAQ US Benchmark Index. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS)’s expense ratio came in at 0.60%. It is one of the best momentum ETFs to buy.\n\nModine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) is the largest holding of Invesco DWA SmallCap Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:DWAS). The company specializes in providing engineered heat transfer systems and components for OEM vehicular applications. On March 19, Oppenheimer assigned an Outperform rating to Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) and set a price target of $105. Analyst Noah Kaye highlighted Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD)’s expansion into data centers and diversification as drivers for potential positive earnings revisions. Additionally, Kaye noted the company's involvement in scaling electric vehicles and the potential for mergers and acquisitions in climate solutions as further catalysts for growth.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 28 hedge funds were bullish on Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD), compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nCarillon Chartwell Small Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) was another strong performer. Modine’s performance technologies segment is experiencing high demand as it provides thermal solutions for electronic vehicle (EV) and hybrid vehicle manufacturers. The company also has focused on growth opportunities in the data-center market, selling data center cooling solutions needed for energy intensive artificial intelligence (AI) projects.”\n\n8. Fidelity Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE:FDMO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 78.85%\n\nFidelity Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE:FDMO) ranks 8th on our list of the best momentum ETFs. Fidelity Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE:FDMO) aims to replicate the performance of the Fidelity U.S. Momentum Factor Index before fees and expenses. This index is tailored to mirror the performance of large and mid-cap US companies showing positive momentum signals. As of December 31, 2023, the ETF has net assets of $161.4 million and an expense ratio of 0.15%, along with a portfolio of 130 stocks.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest holding of Fidelity Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE:FDMO). Despite reports of weaker demand in China, Apple's iPhone builds remained stable, while competitors Samsung and Huawei saw increases in the first quarter of 2024, surpassing TD Cowen's projections as of March 26. However, TD Cowen expects Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to produce 48 million iPhone units in Q1 2024, marking a 14% year-over-year decrease, with a further decline to 39 million units in Q2, representing a 7% drop compared to the previous year.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 905.56 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”\n\n7. Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 88.24%\n\nInvesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM) tracks the S&P 600 High Momentum Value Index, which comprises 120 securities from the S&P SmallCap 600 Index with the highest combined \"value scores\" and \"momentum scores\". Constituents of the index are weighted based on their value scores, with higher scores receiving greater weights. As of March 25, 2024, Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM)’s expense ratio stood at 0.36%. It is one of the best momentum ETFs to buy.\n\nKelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) is the top holding of Invesco S&P SmallCap Value with Momentum ETF (NYSE:XSVM). Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) offers workforce solutions across different industries through its five segments – Professional & Industrial, Science, Engineering & Technology, Education, Outsourcing & Consulting, and International. On February 15, Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.93 and a revenue of $1.23 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.37 and $10 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 14 hedge funds were bullish on Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA), compared to 10 funds in the last quarter.\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) is one of the top stocks for momentum investors.\n\nHere is what Palm Valley Capital Management has to say about Kelly Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:KELYA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“We acquired four new positions during the quarter—two of these were recycled. The Fund bought back Kelly Services (NASDAQ:KELYA), a prior holding, and established a new weighting in ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN). Both companies serve the staffing industry. Staffing is cyclical, and we expect results for these companies to deteriorate in a recession, even though margins haven’t fully recovered yet from the lockdowns. In our judgment, during previous downturns, their operating performance was acceptable for a cyclical trough. We believe the valuations for Kelly and Manpower are becoming increasingly compelling. Kelly trades at a 46% discount to tangible book value. The company’s net assets are primarily supported by a mountain of receivables. Neither Kelly nor Manpower experienced significant credit losses during the last recession. ManpowerGroup’s $4 billion Enterprise Value is 6.7x its five-year average operating income before amortization, which includes a trough in 2020. Manpower is based in the U.S., but it earns the majority of revenues from Europe. We think the firm’s European exposure has placed it in the doghouse among investors, given the unique risks facing those economies. Manpower’s translated results are also weighed down by the rocketing U.S. dollar…” (Click here to see the full text)\n\n6. Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 26: 90.11%\n\nVanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO) employs a rules-based quantitative model to assess US common stocks, focusing on those with robust recent performance. The fund's portfolio encompasses a range of stocks across different market capitalizations, market sectors, and industry groups. Its benchmark is the Russell 3000 Index. Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO) is one of the best momentum ETFs to monitor. As of March 25, 2024, the fund’s expense ratio came in at 0.13%, along with net assets of $452.1 million and a portfolio of 574 stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the largest holding of Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF ETF Shares (BATS:VFMO). On March 18, Mizuho Securities added Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as a top pick, maintaining a Buy rating and a $575 price target on the shares. Analyst James Lee predicts stron\n\ng revenue growth for the company in fiscal 2024, driven by improvements in Reels monetization, geographic expansion, Amazon partnership with Shops, and optimized video placements. Long-term investments in WhatsApp, generative AI, and Llama could also lead to a significant increase in revenue per user.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 242 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), compared to 234 funds in the last quarter.\n\nSequoia Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Two additional trims, in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Carmax, were more substantive in nature. When Meta’s stock declined in 2022, we judged it to be significantly mispriced and held our ground through the bottom. We trimmed the position serially last year as the stock soared because we were wary of holding a large position exposed to significant regulatory risks, particularly in Europe. We are comfortable owning Meta at today’s much-reduced weighting and current valuation. The smaller position size reflects our updated assessment of the balance of long-term risk versus reward.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n20 States That Produce the Most Renewable Energy in the US 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2024 14 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None. 10 Best Momentum ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "2 Stocks That Can Double Again in 2024",
        "content": "There are just 17 U.S. exchange-listed companies with market caps greater than $1 billion that have more than doubled in 2024. Most of them won't double again. Market sentiment will rotate elsewhere, and some of them will fall out of favor.\n\nLet's focus on the winners with legs. I think two of them -- SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG) -- have the ingredients to potentially double again before the end of this year. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. SoundHound AI: Up 174%\n\nThis is the second year in a row that SoundHound AI has gotten off to a hot start after the ball drops in Times Square. A leader in conversational intelligence, SoundHound doubled in 2023 by Feb. 6. It gave back most of those gains by the end of the year. This time around, it got there by Feb. 26. Can it sustain the early gain in 2024?\n\nYes, the AI at the end of its name stands for artificial intelligence. The voice recognition specialist operates a platform that gives its customers AI-enhanced tools for speech recognition, transcription, and computer-generated speech, delivering a better conversational experience. Revenue growth is potent, with back-to-back years of 47% jumps. It's starting to pick up the pace. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRevenue soared 80% in SoundHound's latest quarter. Its guidance calls for $63 million to $77 million in revenue this year, a 53% improvement at the midpoint. It recently initiated its outlook for 2025, looking to top $100 million next year. In short, it sees revenue climbing at least 43% in 2025.\n\nSoundHound has been too ambitious in the past. It was initially targeting a 50% top-line surge for 2023, and it fell just shy of its forecast. The bottom line is another story worth watching. Analysts see at least another two years of losses, but SoundHound's operating and net loss narrowed in 2023 following restructuring and other cost-cutting measures. Wall Street pros see the deficit continuing to narrow this year and again in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wasn't SoundHound's fourth quarter that sent the stock soaring last month. Just two weeks before its financial update, AI kingmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)disclosed a small position in SoundCloud. Is Nvidia planning to buy it whole, or is it just impressed enough with SoundHound's voice AI technology to keep it close? The situation is a good one for SoundHound investors either way, but investors also need to be realistic: This was just a small $3.7 million investment by the gargantuan Nvidia. SoundHound shares have responded enough to increase the company's market cap by more than $1.1 billion this young year. The stock may seem susceptible at this point, but don't be surprised if it surges when AI stocks heat up again.\n\n2. Sweetgreen: Up 116%\n\nLet's talk greens, and not just the green that Sweetgreen investors are seeing this year. The fast-growing chain selling premium salads and warm bowls is thriving. Telecommuters have returned to the office, and with that comes the need for prepared meals and the ability to pay up for a quality lunch.\n\nSweetgreen saw its revenue climb 29% in its latest quarter. Opening new eateries is the key top-line driver, but that's not cannibalizing existing locations. Same-store sales still rose 6% in the quarter.\n\nIts latest financial update may not seem like enough of a catalyst for this year's big move higher. The bottom line is still problematic, and Sweetgreen has posted larger-than-expected losses in its last three quarters. Its guidance for 2024 is encouraging, and Sweetgreen expects to finally post positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year. However, the key to understanding the stock's recent ascent begins by focusing on the starting line.\n\nSweetgreen went public at $28 in 2021, peaking north of $50 in its first few minutes of trading. Sweetgreen kept growing, but the stock kept shrinking. The stock began this year at $11.30. It has more than doubled so far this year, but it's still a broken IPO. The shares have now quadrupled from the all-time low from 12 months ago, but it's still below its $28 price tag as a debutante.\n\nIt can keep building on this momentum. Sweetgreen is a better company now than it was when it went public in late 2021. It shouldn't be less valuable. If it can keep expanding briskly, posting positive comps, and improving restaurant-level operating margin, it can double again from here. If so, then the salad days may finally be here for Sweetgreen.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The broader index has scaled up nearly 30% since its closing low on Oct 27 and surpassed its all-time high last week.\n\nSkeptics have, thus, started to question whether all the positive news is already priced in the market. Many of them believe that the S&P 500 is due for a pullback, thanks to the over-extended rally, while most of the stocks listed in the index have become expensive.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 has, time and again, registered gains in the rest of the year following a solid first quarter. Jefferies noted that since 1970, whenever the S&P 500 has notched average gains of 2.5% in the first quarter, it has tended to beat its average second-quarter gain of nearly 2.6% by 60 basis points, or 0.6%. And if the S&P 500 can gain more than 10% in the first quarter, the second quarter gains are even more encouraging, averaging 3.3%.\n\nFurthermore, chief investment strategist Sam Stovall at the CFRA said that strong first-quarter performance since 1945, or the end of the Second World War, has always resulted in superb full-year gains. This time around, the stock market is well-poised to continue its winning streak, banking on AI optimism and the Federal Reserve’s assurance of three interest rate cuts later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh-growth players, including tech stocks, are witnessing their shares move upward by leaps and bounds as AI has resulted in several technological headways. AI integration has led to an increase in labor productivity and financial growth for countless tech firms (read more: 3 Solid AI Stocks Worth a Look for the Rest of the Year).\n\nThe Fed, meanwhile, has kept interest rates unaltered in its latest policy meeting and has reiterated that it’s sticking with its prediction of a series of interest rate cuts soon. Rate cuts no doubt bode well for the economy vis-à-vis the stock market as it increases consumer spending and reduces borrowing costs.\n\nConsumers, anyhow, remained resilient on the back of a strong labor market despite sticky inflationary pressure and decreasing pandemic savings (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain on Signs of Household Spending Resilience).\n\nThus, with fears of the recession on the ebb and the stock market expected to continue its growth trajectory, it’s judicious for astute investors to place bets on stocks that not only gained traction in the first quarter but also are well-poised to scale northward along with the broader market.\n\nThese stocks are American Eagle Outfitters, Abercrombie & Fitch, Cimpress, Dianthus Therapeutics, Inc. and NVIDIA Corporation.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's top 12 stocks picks. To skip our detailed analysis of Druckenmiller’s hedge fund and his recent movements in the market, go directly to read Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller, a billionaire and hedge fund manager, gained fame for his bet against the British pound while managing George Soros' Quantum Fund in 1992. Together, they reportedly amassed a $1 billion profit from the transactions. Druckenmiller also operated his own hedge fund from 1981 to 2010, delivering an average annual return of 30% for clients. Currently, he oversees capital through the Duquesne Family Office, primarily catering to a select group of clients. The investment arm employs a diversified strategy, targeting multiple industries such as technology, financial services, and consumer discretionary sectors. With a net worth exceeding $6 billion, Druckenmiller is widely regarded for his guidance and perspectives on the market's trajectory.\n\nRecently, the billionaire investor was seen making significant adjustments to the investment portfolio of his investment fund management firm. According to filings, Druckenmiller reduced holdings in traditional tech companies while adding new positions in artificial intelligence (AI) and gold-related shares. Notably, Duquesne sold Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares for $112 million during the fourth quarter after acquiring them in Q3 2023. In contrast, Druckenmiller, having expressed optimism about gold, made relatively modest investments in two gold companies: Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), the largest gold extraction corporation, and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), another major gold mining company, with 1.76 million and 474,000 shares respectively.\n\nDuquesne's concentration on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been in the works for at least a year, as the office acquired a combined $430 million in both companies in early 2023. The bullish sentiment towards Microsoft is further fueled by its AI initiatives, with the company integrating the technology into its cloud and software services.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith these details in mind, let’s take a look at some of the top stock picks in Stanley Druckenmiller’s portfolio. Some notable names in this list include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Top 12 Stock Picks\n\nStanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the following 12 stocks from Stanley Druckenmiller’s stock portfolio as of Q4 2023. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment towards each stock, which was assessed from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the last quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of Duquesne Capital's stake value in each holding.\n\nHedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n12. KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 47\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $64.1 million\n\nKBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR), previously known as Kellogg Brown & Root, is a United States-based company specializing in science, technology, and engineering services. Operating across diverse sectors including aerospace, defense, industrial, and intelligence, KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR) serves various markets. Formed in 1998 following Halliburton's acquisition of Dresser Industries, the company emerged from the merger of M.W. Kellogg and Halliburton's construction subsidiary, Brown & Root.\n\nDuring last year’s December quarter, 47 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database had held a stake in the company. The largest KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR) hedge fund shareholder is Alex Duran and Scott Hendrickson’s Permian Investment Partners as it owns 2.7 million shares that are worth $153 million. That same quarter, Druckenmiller increased his stake in the company by 130%, boosting his stake in KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR) to $64.1 million.\n\nMuch like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Stanley Druckenmiller loves KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR).\n\n11. UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $74.88 million\n\nUBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) is a worldwide financial institution providing financial guidance and solutions to private, institutional, and corporate clients. The company operates through four divisions: Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management, and Investment Bank. On February 6, UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) announced a proposed dividend of $0.70 per share, representing a 27% increase from the previous year's ordinary dividend. Shareholders as of May 2 will receive the dividend, payable on May 3.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 35 hedge funds were bullish on UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS), compared to 33 funds in the last quarter. Cevian Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 43.7 million shares worth $1.35 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) is a name we opportunistically purchased following the banking crisis earlier in the year. UBS benefited from buying its largest local competitor, Credit Suisse, for an 80% discount from where it was trading before the crisis. We bought after the deal, believing the market’s myopic focus on short-term integration risks failed to properly value the attractive set of assets. While the stock has done well since then, we still believe it is underappreciating the long-term return potential of the business.”\n\n10. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $91.87 million\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), headquartered in Irving, Texas, is a prominent integrated retail electricity and power generation company serving customers, businesses, and communities across the United States, spanning from California to Maine. Renowned for its leadership in the energy transformation sector, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of energy.\n\nOn March 1, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Energy Harbor Corp. This strategic move enhances Vistra's position in the integrated zero-carbon generation and retail electricity market by adding approximately 4,000 megawatts of 24/7 nuclear generation capacity and expanding its customer base by approximately 1 million retail customers.\n\nBy the end of 2023’s fourth quarter, 56 out of the 933 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey were the firm’s investors. Stanley Druckenmiller owned approximately $92 million worth of VST shares as of the end of 2023\n\n9. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 92\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $93.94 million\n\nEstablished in 1892 and based in Boston, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stands as a prominent American multinational conglomerate. Operating across diverse sectors such as aerospace, power, renewable energy, digital industry, additive manufacturing, and venture capital and finance.\n\nOn March 11, investment advisory firm Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) stock and raised the price target to $177 from $156.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2021, Insider Monkey's database indicated that 92 hedge funds held stakes in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), totaling $12.2 billion. This reflects an increase from the previous quarter, where 76 hedge funds held stakes valued at $10.3 billion.\n\n8. News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $99.3 million\n\nNews Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS), commonly known as News Corp, is a major American mass media and publishing company headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was established on June 28, 2013, through the spin-off of the media assets of the original News Corporation, which became 21st Century Fox.\n\nThe Dow Jones segment of the media conglomerate, home to renowned financial publications including The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and MarketWatch, generated $584 million in revenue for the December quarter. This marked a 4% increase from the same quarter in 2022, driven by heightened demand for the segment's bundled subscription offerings.\n\nDuring 2023’s fourth quarter, 17 out of the 933 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey were News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWS)’s shareholders. The firm’s largest hedge fund shareholder is Donald Yacktman’s Yacktman Asset Management through its $410 million stake.\n\n7. Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 75\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $111.1 million\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), an American multinational corporation, specializes in providing critical infrastructure and services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments. On February 21, the company released its fourth-quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share for the period were reported at $0.56, exceeding estimates by $0.03. However, revenue for the quarter saw a 12.7% year-over-year increase, reaching $1.87 billion, falling short of estimates by $0.03.\n\nAs of Q4 2023, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) was one of the top picks in Stanley Druckenmiller's portfolio. A total of 75 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held its shares, valued at $3.1 billion.\n\nClearBridge SMID Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Within IT, AI trends continue to positively impact order trends at data center and technology hardware companies to the benefit of companies like Monolithic Power Systems, our top-performing holding during the quarter. Enthusiasm supplying power management for Nvidia’s AI GPUs supported both strong 2023 performance and a robust future outlook. This strong demand also translated into positive performance for industrials holding Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), a leader in power and thermal management and related tools and systems used by data centers. However, we continue to monitor the sustainability of such trends, as well as their valuations, on a case-by-case basis. As a result, we trimmed the position size of both of these investments, following strong stock performance.”\n\n6. Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:STX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nDuquesne Capital’s Q4 2023 Investment Value: $180.65 million\n\nSeagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:STX) is an American data storage company with roots tracing back to 1978 when it was established as Shugart Technology, officially commencing operations in 1979. Since 2010, the company has been headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, while maintaining operational headquarters in Fremont, California, United States.\n\nIn late January, Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:STX) projected its third-quarter revenue in line with analysts' expectations, signaling optimism amid the ongoing recovery in the personal computer (PC) and cloud markets. This recovery is anticipated to drive demand for Seagate's data storage products. With the introduction of artificial intelligence-powered PCs this year and a gradually stabilizing economy, there is anticipation that the post-pandemic slump experienced by data-storage solution providers will come to an end. Seagate forecasts revenue for the quarter ending March 31 to be around $1.65 billion, plus or minus $150 million, aligning closely with analysts' estimates of $1.64 billion.\n\nDuquesne Capital still retains Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:STX) in its portfolio, holding approximately 2.1 million shares, as per its latest 13F filing. Overall, 38 hedge funds held positions in the company as of the quarter.\n\nSeagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:STX) joins the ranks of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) as one of Stanley Druckemiller's top stock picks.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution 14 Best Climate Change Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds 12 Best Biotech Penny Stocks to Invest In\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "If There Were a \"Magnificent Seven\" Purely for AI Stocks, These Would Be My Top Picks",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" includes some of the largest tech-oriented companies. But not every Magnificent Seven component could be considered a true artificial intelligence (AI) play.\n\nIf there were a new Magnificent Seven purely for AI stocks, then I would keep Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), but swap out Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla for Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), and Deere (NYSE: DE).\n\nHere's why these seven companies are all excellent ways to invest in AI from various industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe poster child of the AI craze, Nvidia's growth is mostly due to sales to data centers. Faster and more secure processing power is needed to support complex AI solutions. And that's exactly what Nvidia is giving the industry.\n\nThe greatest risk to Nvidia is a slowdown in demand from its data center business. Operating income from its compute and networking segment (led by data centers) increased more than sixfold between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\n\nIf demand slows, the growth could shrink as fast as it rose. However, an extreme slowdown is unlikely if AI investments pay off for Nvidia's customers.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms plans to spend $10 billion on Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2024. To quote Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the Q4 fiscal 2024 earnings call:\n\nCompanies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation, and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.\n\nMeta is leveraging AI to boost user engagement, improve its algorithm, and better align ads to interested users. Instagram has become arguably the most valuable digital real estate in the world, and will likely stay that way thanks to Meta's AI investments.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nThe third and final Magnificent Seven stock that also deserves to be in the AI Magnificent Seven is Microsoft. The company's results show how AI can improve performance and accelerate growth even from established solutions.\n\nMicrosoft Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot, Azure AI, and more are some of the many ways Microsoft uses AI to improve solutions without breaking what already works.\n\nMicrosoft makes so much money that it can invest in AI, fund its long-term growth, and still have plenty of cash to buy back stock and raise its dividend. The company is positioned to continue monetizing AI across business-to-business and business-to-consumer platforms.\n\n4. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAMD often traded in tandem with Nvidia, but the company is actually quite different. For one, AMD isn't growing as fast -- yet. However, optimistic investors believe it can unlock explosive growth by competing with Nvidia in the GPU market for AI applications and CPUs for AI-enabled PCs.\n\nIn 2023, data center revenue grew just 7.5% year over year and made up less than 29% of total revenue. So while AMD's growth is expected to happen, Nvidia's growth is occurring right now.\n\nAMD will have to deliver to justify its lofty valuation, but it's certainly one of the most innovative and exciting AI plays out there for risk-tolerant investors.\n\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, commonly known as TSMC, is perhaps the safest way to invest in the AI-fueled semiconductor space.\n\nTSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, and others. It's a similar dynamic to Apple, which designs its products but relies on its suppliers for materials, manufacturing, and assembly.\n\nWhile these suppliers are usually low-margin, high-volume businesses, TSMC fabs handle some of the most complex and precise workflows in the world. TSMC is compensated accordingly, with an operating margin that has mostly ranged from 35% to 50% over the last decade -- far higher than your typical manufacturer.\n\nIn this vein, TSMC wins as long as chip demand goes up. It doesn't matter if AMD takes market share from Nvidia, so long as the industry is growing.\n\nTSMC is not nearly as expensive as other top chip stocks, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.7. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n6. Adobe\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Adobe's growth was slowing. Subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) business models are great for their consistent revenue. However, innovation and product improvements are needed to retain and grow the customer base, as well as justify price increases. AI has opened the door to some of Adobe's biggest leaps in years.\n\nAbout a year ago, Adobe released Firefly, its generative AI tool for Creative Cloud, and many other products. The impact is already visible in Adobe's numbers, but the company is spending a lot of money to roll out these tools, which is straining profits.\n\nAdobe is in customer acquisition mode, hoping to boost Firefly users and grow engagement as quickly as possible. It's a good long-term strategy that focuses on where Adobe could be several years from now, not on where it is today. Patient investors may want to consider buying Adobe now, with the understanding that Wall Street may sell the stock if Adobe puts up weak quarterly results.\n\n7. Deere\n\nYou may be wondering how we went from hypergrowth chip stocks to a tractor company. Well, part of the reason was to spice up the list with something outside the tech sector. Deere is a sleeper AI play -- and has been for some time now.\n\nDeere released its Smart Industrial strategy in 2022. And it's already having an impact on its results. The company is betting that farms will become increasingly automated in the future. Examples would include automated crop spacing, how much fertilizer to use and where, and even a fully autonomous tractor.\n\nBuzzwords aside, the idea is to use technology to lower costs and boost crop yield. It doesn't really matter how it's packaged, so long as these tools are boosting business for Deere's customers.\n\nAI can benefit farm sustainability and efficiency, and Deere is one of the easiest ways to invest in that trend.\n\nInvest in AI in a way that's right for you\n\nFrom obvious plays like Nvidia to a well-known legacy brand like Deere, companies across industries are investing in AI to accelerate growth. Every industry is up for disruption. Some changes will happen gradually. Others could happen sooner than expected.\n\nThe key is investing in what you understand and with a long-term mindset.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Lewis Kaufman is, depending on who you ask, a phony or a genius.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Trump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Japan Steps Closer to Intervention as Yen Hits Lowest Since 1990 Vital Baltimore Bridge Collapses After Being Struck by Ship\n\nFirst, the genius part. Kaufman has come up with a formula for generating double-digit annual returns in emerging-market stocks, a rare feat in a market that has gone nowhere for years.\n\nThe phony critique: He’s done it largely by loading up the fund he manages at Artisan Partners — the Artisan Developing World Fund — with high-flying US tech stocks.\n\nTo his detractors, this is absurd. What do Nvidia and Snowflake and Crowdstrike have to do with emerging markets? He just jammed them into the fund, they contend, to goose returns and push his fund’s performance to No. 1 in emerging markets. “It’s disingenuous at best,” says Kevin Harper, chief investment officer at Almanack Investment Partners.\n\nTo Kaufman and his backers, this is merely the idle chatter of envious rivals and other industry types who haven’t spent enough time to understand what he’s doing. Nvidia and Snowflake and Crowdstrike are indeed emerging-market stocks, Kaufman argues, if you expand your definition to include those companies that get a chunk of their revenue in developing nations. Investing in only stocks that fit the classic, narrower definition of emerging-market companies, he says, has led to such poor returns — the benchmark MSCI index is essentially unchanged over the past 17 years — that a broader approach is needed.\n\n“We’re not trying to avoid emerging markets,” Kaufman says. “We’re trying to embrace them, and we’re trying to do it in a thoughtful and creative way.”\n\nThoughtful and creative means that, as of the last public filing, more than 40% of the fund’s $3 billion was invested in US-based companies. It’s not just tech stocks. It’s also names like Coca-Cola and Visa and Estee Lauder. Throw in European stocks and the percent of Kaufman’s portfolio invested in companies based in developed nations comes to more than 50%. The median number for rival emerging-market funds is 5%, according to Morningstar Direct.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this underscores the hands-off approach that regulators have long taken when it comes to the selection of fund names. For years, asset managers could pretty much just choose whatever name they wanted, regardless of the makeup of the assets they held.\n\nThat began to change in 2001, when the SEC first rolled out guidelines on the use of names. Unsatisfied with industry compliance and concerned by the wave of funds purporting to be focused on ESG hitting the market, the SEC stiffened those rules last year. The changes will bolster requirements that mutual funds and ETFs put at least 80% of their money in the kind of assets suggested by their name.\n\nA spokesman for Artisan said it’s too soon to gauge the impact the new rules will have on Kaufman’s fund.\n\nInvestors, in any event, have proven a bit cool to his approach. While his fund outperformed all other large emerging-market stock funds over the past five years, it lured almost no new money — on a net basis — during that time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTo Bill Rocco, a senior research analyst at Morningstar, the unusual nature of the fund is at least partially responsible for the lack of inflows. Rocco likes Kaufman as a stock picker — he’s a “good investor” — but finds the fund to be “a weird fit” for the category.\n\n“This is not your grandmother’s emerging-market fund,” says Rocco. “Giving good managers a little more flexibility is good” but at some point “you cross a threshold where you’re not really that kind of fund anymore.”\n\nKaufman, 48, started on Wall Street in the 1990s. He did stints at Citigroup and Morgan Stanley before moving on to Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where in 2009, he launched his first emerging-markets fund. He quickly started loading it up with stocks based outside of the developing world, bringing the percentage at times to over 20%, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nThat move paid off as the economic boom that had swept across emerging markets in the 2000s fizzled. After five years, the Thornburg Developing World Fund was up 56% — compared with 9% for the benchmark emerging-market index — and Kaufman was attracting attention.\n\nAmong those watching: Eric Colson, the CEO of Artisan Partners, a boutique investment firm based in Milwaukee. In 2015, he hired Kaufman.\n\nColson says the “uniqueness” of Kaufman’s portfolio was a big lure back then and that he remains a firm believer in it today. “Lewis represents how creative perspective and degrees of freedom can have a positive impact on investment outcomes,” Colson said in a statement.\n\nKaufman likes to refer to the non-emerging market companies in his portfolio as passport companies, a nod to how they’re able to set up operations in developing nations to tap into rising demand. “We just invest in companies that are economically tied to emerging markets,” he says. “Some of those are based in emerging markets and some of them aren’t.”\n\nDevesh Shah is a big fan of this approach.\n\nA retired partner at Goldman Sachs who now writes for the Mutual Fund Observer, Shah says investors have to choose whether they “want to be pure” about their definition of emerging-market stocks — and sacrifice potential returns in the process — or “trust the fund manager.” Shah’s chosen to trust Kaufman. He began investing in the Artisan fund last year.\n\nEven by Kaufman’s standards, the current tilt in his portfolio to passport companies is pronounced. As recently as 2019, they had made up less than 25% of his holdings. That percentage soared during the pandemic as he tapped into the tech-stock rally. His fund gained 82% in 2020, sunk the next two years and then sharply rebounded over the past 15 months.\n\nAmong the criticisms lobbed at Kaufman is that it’s a stretch to think of the likes of Nvidia, Snowflake and Crowdstrike as plays on emerging-market growth. Each of the companies gets more than half of its revenue in the US alone. In Snowflake’s case, it’s almost 80%. Another chunk of their revenue then comes from Europe.\n\nHarper, the CIO at Almanack, a wealth-management firm based outside Philadelphia, notes that most investors already have lots of exposure to tech stocks in their portfolios. So why give them even more of those stocks in their emerging-market fund, he asks.\n\nHarper got worked up as he voiced publicly what many others in the industry whispered in private: Kaufman’s strategy, while perfectly legal, is misleading. “It’s insane,” he says. Everyone else in the market is trying to generate returns by picking the right developing-nation stocks, and Kaufman should do the same.\n\nKaufman’s volatile returns have actually been more correlated with MSCI’s global gauge of growth stocks than the emerging-market benchmark. When measured against growth funds, his returns look ordinary. Over the past five years, the fund would have ranked 202nd among the 323 biggest growth funds in the US, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nKaufman is unfazed by the volatility. It just comes with the territory, he says, when seeking outsize returns.\n\nWhat’s more, he says all the focus on his tech-stock holdings ignores the fact that he’s been trimming those positions. He sold almost 80% of the Nvidia shares he held last year and more than 40% of both the Netflix and Airbnb shares. He plowed some of that cash into less volatile US stocks and some of it into shares in India, one of only five developing countries his fund is investing in. (The others are Argentina, Brazil, China and Singapore.)\n\nHis holdings of Indian stocks quadrupled to 12% of the portfolio in February from 3% at the end of 2022. And yet, in a sign of just how unconventional the fund is, that’s still well below the country’s 18% weighting in the MSCI benchmark index.\n\n“Tracking a number doesn’t necessarily tell the story,” Kaufman says. “I run an emerging markets fund. I want stores of value for when times get tough.”\n\n--With assistance from Lydia Beyoud.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley Hong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn’t Classified Tesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue Jokes, Pop Music and Radical Honesty: How TikTok Is Changing Home Sales\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Growth stocks allow investors to outperform the market in the long run. These assets often exhibit high revenue growth and have captivating growth opportunities. Some growth-oriented corporations aren’t profitable quite yet, which poses more risks but can lead to a higher potential upside.\n\nWhile speculating on those types of growth stocks can lead to high returns, it’s less risky to focus on growth stocks that have already proven their business models. These corporations generate positive earnings instead of relying on shareholder dilution and capital from other sources to make ends meet. Investors looking for promising growth stocks for the next bull run may want to consider these picks.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) isn’t a tech company or a flashy name you will see in the news. It offers business supplies and services for many companies. Some of Cintas’ products include uniforms, floor care, restroom supplies and safety products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company serves more than one million businesses in the United States and Canada. Despite the largest customer pool, Cintas still has a large addressable market that includes 16 million businesses in North America. Cintas isn’t likely to get the entire pie, but it can gain market share and raise prices to increase shareholder value.\n\nThe company has been using its capital to make acquisitions, strategic capital expenditures and to reward investors. The corporation has raised its dividend each year since 1983 and does regular stock buybacks. Cintas reported another solid quarter which featured 9.3% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth and 15.5% YoY net income growth.\n\nCintas stock is up by 45% over the past year and has gained 211% over the past 5 years. It is a promising long-term dividend growth stock with a $64 billion market cap.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s dividend and efforts to cut costs have reinvigorated its growth and helped the stock get out of a rut. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the social media leader by a wide margin. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are the big players within the Meta Platforms umbrella.\n\nThose social networks and their advertising revenue helped the stock gain 146% over the past year. Impressive net profit margin expansion has resulted in a 33 P/E ratio and contributed to a 43% year-to-date gain for the stock.\n\nFourth quarter results highlighted the company’s resurgence. Revenue increased by 25% YoY while net income more than tripled during that timeframe. Each platform is attracting more daily active users. Meta Platforms knows how to get people’s attention and increase the average amount of time people spend on social media. People who spend more time on social networks end up seeing more advertisements which helps Meta Platform’s financials.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills.

Net income increased by 769% YoY, demonstrating higher profit margins.\n\nRevenue and net income growth both outpaced the stock’s 254% gain over the past year. The stock has minted millionaires thanks to its nearly 2,000% gain over the past five years. The stock is even starting strong in 2024 thanks to a 93% year-to-date gain.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia May Be in a Bubble, but These 3 AI Stocks Have Never Been Cheaper",
        "content": "Wall Street is a stomping ground for innovation. Since the advent of the internet three decades ago, there have been a long list of next-big-thing trends and innovations that have come down the line, including genome decoding, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, just to name a few. However, none of these trends offers the game-changing potential that artificial intelligence (AI) has brought to the table.\n\nWith AI, businesses are using software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. Machine learning gives these systems and software the ability to evolve over time and become more effective at their tasks, as well as potentially learn new tasks. The broad-ranging utility of AI is what compelled the researchers at PwC to estimate that it could add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia stock has soared, thanks to AI, but may be in a bubble\n\nThough there are dozens of publicly traded companies set to benefit from the AI revolution, none have enjoyed a more direct boost than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. With Nvidia meaningfully increasing production of its core AI-GPUs, it's unlikely the company will cede much in the way of data center market share -- at least in the first-half of the year.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), Nvidia's data center sales more than tripled to $47.5 billion. While innovation did the talking, Nvidia's biggest \"weapon\" has been its pricing power. Enterprise demand for high-powered GPUs has swamped supply, which has allowed Nvidia to rapidly increase the selling price of its units.\n\nUnfortunately, this fairy tale story for Nvidia may come to an end sooner than later if history has anything to say about it.\n\nOver the past 30 years, there hasn't been a single next-big-thing trend that didn't involve an early stage bubble. History has shown that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption/uptake of a new technology, trend, or innovation. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there's more to be concerned about than just historic correlations. There's the real potential for Nvidia to cannibalize its own gross margin as it expands production of its prized GPUs and newly introduced Blackwell chip. GPU scarcity was the core driver of data center sales growth in fiscal 2024. As external competitors enter the space and Nvidia ups its own output, this scarcity will dwindle and, more than likely, erode some of its gross margin.\n\nWorse yet, Nvidia's four largest customers by sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own. These \"Magnificent Seven\" components are either going to lessen their reliance on Nvidia in future years or entirely replace its infrastructure in in-house data centers.\n\nAll of these factors suggest that Nvidia's stock may be in a bubble.\n\nForget Nvidia: These AI stocks have never been cheaper\n\nBut this doesn't mean all artificial intelligence stocks are in a bubble or at risk of a collapse if history rhymes, once more. Three AI stocks, which have never been cheaper on the basis of forward-year earnings and share a common trait, appear to be much smarter buys for investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe first AI stock that looks like a phenomenal value when placed side-by-side with the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia, is none other than China's leading e-commerce platform Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nMost investors are familiar with Alibaba because it's an online retail juggernaut in the world's No. 2 economy by GDP. Estimates from the International Trade Association in 2023 pegged Taobao and Tmall as controlling close to 51% of China's e-commerce market share, on a combined basis. The country's burgeoning middle class suggests e-commerce can provide superior growth rates for years to come.\n\nBut what investors might not know about Alibaba is that its cloud infrastructure service platform, Alibaba Cloud, accounted for more than a third of China's cloud infrastructure service spend during the first quarter of 2023. Alibaba Cloud is leaning on generative AI solutions to assist businesses in building applications that can improve customer interactions. Enterprise cloud spending in China is still in its very early innings.\n\nDespite being the undisputed e-commerce and cloud infrastructure service leader in China, Alibaba's valuation has never been this cheap. Backing out the roughly $92 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments Alibaba closed out 2023 with, shares of the company are trading at less than 5 times consensus forward-year earnings. Even factoring in the regulatory risk factors that come with putting your money to work in China, Alibaba looks like a screaming bargain.\n\nJD.com\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that's historically cheap and would make for a smarter buy than Nvidia is China's No. 2 e-commerce player, JD.com(NASDAQ: JD). That's right, a second China stock!\n\nAs I pointed out with Alibaba, online retail sales in China are still early in their ramp phase, which is fantastic news for the entire industry. But JD.com holds an advantage that might make it an even more attractive buy than Alibaba. Whereas China's leading e-commerce company relies heavily on third-party sellers, JD is predominantly a direct-to-consumer (DTC) retailer. Like Amazon, it controls the inventory and logistics required to get purchased products to consumers. Having more control over the DTC process should lead to superior margins over the long run.\n\nWhile JD.com isn't anywhere near close to the same level as Alibaba when it comes to AI dominance, it did debut large language model ChatRhino last year. The goal for JD with ChatRhino is to help businesses shorten innovation timelines and quickly resolve supply chain issues across a variety of industries. ChatRhino was in development two years prior to its launch and has the potential to lift JD's growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, JD was sitting on a treasure chest of $22.7 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and various investments. JD is valued at less than 8 times forward earnings, and more than half of its market cap is derived from its net cash balance. All risk appears to be baked into JD's stock at its current valuation.\n\nBaidu\n\nThe third AI company that's never been cheaper at a time when Nvidia stock appears to be in a bubble is China's leading internet search engine Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). In case you haven't noticed, the trait these stocks all share is that they're based in the world's No. 2 economy (China).\n\nBaidu's foundational segment has long been its internet search engine. Although Alphabet's internet search engine Google dominates globally, Baidu is the kingpin within China. It held a 60% share of internet search in China in February, and has, with few exceptions, sustained a 60% to 85% share of domestic internet search dating back nine years. If businesses want to target Chinese consumers with their message(s), there's a high probability they're going to use Baidu.\n\nMore importantly, Baidu is also a key player in China's rapidly growing cloud infrastructure service arena. During the March-ended quarter in 2023, Baidu's AI Cloud had grabbed an 8% share of spending, which ranked fourth in the country behind Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.\n\nFurther, Baidu is the worldwide leader in intelligent driving. Subsidiary Apollo Go has completed more than 5 million autonomous rides on public roads since its inception.\n\nRounding things out, Baidu stock is dirt cheap. Shares can be purchased right now for about 8 times forward-year earnings. But this doesn't factor in the company's more than $28 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and various investments. The risk-versus-reward profile overwhelmingly favors upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Its flagship H100 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) played a major role in helping it deliver this outstanding growth.\n\nThe waiting periods for buyers to obtain the H100 were as long as eight to 11 months at one point last year. However, the company's aggressive focus on boosting chip supply allowed it to eventually bring the waiting period down to three to four months. With robust demand for the H100 and limited supplies of rival options, Nvidia controls a whopping 98% of the data center GPU market, according to a report by Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nThe semiconductor bellwether is now looking to take things up a notch with newly announced AI GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture. These chips will be available later in 2024, and Nvidia is promising massive performance gains at significantly lower power consumption levels.\n\nMore specifically, Nvidia says that its Blackwell chips will allow customers \"to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\" The company is expecting major cloud computing providers to adopt these chips, and is confident that the Blackwell platform will help it grab a bigger share of the data center GPU market, which it estimates is worth $250 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo even though Nvidia's data center revenue rose by a massive 217% to $47.5 billion in its recently ended fiscal 2024, it still has a lot of room to grow in this space. Some analysts estimate that Nvidia could generate a whopping $300 billion in annual revenue from sales of AI chips alone by 2027.\n\nA new and more powerful chip will allow customers to train even bigger large language models (LLMs) and help deliver real-time generative AI applications while consuming significantly less electricity. What's more, the price of a single B200 Blackwell chip will be in the range of $30,000 to $40,000, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. That would be in line with the price of the current H100 processor, suggesting that Nvidia is focused on maintaining its share of this lucrative market with competitive pricing.\n\nAll this explains why Wall Street firms have been raising their price targets on Nvidia stock. Goldman Sachs has raised its Nvidia price target to $1,000 from $875, and Bernstein's is similar. Wells Fargo now has a $970 price target on Nvidia, up from $840 previously.\n\nHow much upside can the stock deliver in the coming year?\n\nNvidia's latest product announcement has led analysts to boost their expectations for the company. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNvidia delivered $60.9 billion in revenue in the previous fiscal year. The chart above indicates that analysts believe its top line is on track to increase by more than 2.5 times in the space of just three years. And they've increased their earnings growth expectations as well. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIf Nvidia can hit almost $25 per share in earnings in its fiscal 2025, which has just begun, its bottom line will nearly double from fiscal 2024's $12.96 per share. Nvidia is currently trading at 75 times earnings. While that's higher than its five-year average multiple of 64, Nvidia's outstanding growth justifies that valuation.\n\nAssuming that a year from now, Nvidia is trading at a relatively discounted 50 times earnings, and has hit $25 per share in earnings, its stock price would be $1,250 -- a 33% increase from current levels. That would exceed the Street-high price target. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia delivering even bigger gains, as the market could reward it with a higher earnings multiple thanks to the terrific growth it has been delivering.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

My name is Mandeep, and I'll be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the TD SYNNEX First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) \r\nAt this time, for opening remarks, I would like to pass the call over to Liz Morali, Head of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.\n\nLiz Morali\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call.

Hume\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong start to the fiscal year with an improving IT spending environment, generating record margins, EPS at the upper end of our expectations, healthy free cash flow and continued strong capital returns to shareholders. \r\nAcross the organization, we are poised to capitalize on a stabilizing demand environment for our core business while continuing to advance our strategy to expand our capabilities in strategic technology areas. \r\nImportantly, we believe that the IT spending environment will continue to improve throughout the year and believe we will return to positive year-over-year gross billings growth next quarter, bolstered in part by the introduction and growth of infrastructure, components and services to support escalating AI-enabled workloads and applications. \r\nWe remain committed to returning excess free cash flow beyond dividends and M&A to shareholders via share repurchases, while also managing our leverage ratio. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a new additional $2 billion share repurchase authorization. \r\nFor our first fiscal quarter, revenue and gross billings were largely in line with our guidance ranges, with the backdrop of a recovering market and continued progress on our strategic portfolio diversification and global line card expansion efforts. \r\nFrom a regional perspective, trends in our markets played out as we had expected. In the Americas, we saw improving year-over-year trends in PCs and a record quarter in Latin America. Europe similarly experienced positive momentum in the PC market but faced challenging year-over-year comparisons in Advanced Solutions, given last year's record performance. Asia Pacific, Japan continued to experience year-over-year growth in constant currency fueled by strength in Advanced Solutions across multiple countries, including emerging markets. \r\nLooking at our results by technology. Within Endpoint Solutions, as anticipated, we saw a slight growth on a year-over-year basis in PCs. We anticipate seeing continued improvement in the PC market as 2024 progresses, aligned with what several OEMs and industry participants have described as a second half weighted spending pattern. We believe this will be driven by several factors, including the new midyear launches of AI-enabled PCs, more customary refresh cycles associated with aged devices and operating system upgrades. This should also drive increased demand for some of our other PC-adjacent categories like peripherals and endpoint software. \r\nStrength in the PC market was offset by softness in demand for mobile devices and some components, which weighed down our results overall in Endpoint Solutions. \r\nConsistent with expectations, Advanced Solutions' year-over-year comparisons were challenged, given the elevated demand and backlog drawdown dynamics we saw in the first half of 2023. Regardless, we had a solid quarter in Advanced Solutions. In addition, we see the beginnings of AI offerings emerging in the portfolio. As an example, we had a very successful launch of Microsoft Copilot, where we enabled more than 2,000 partners with our launch campaign. Overall, we are well positioned to take advantage of the fast-growing AI market. \r\nOur strategic vendor partnerships and enablement programs are helping us to create industry-leading aggregated solutions and serve as a destination for AI solutions in the channel. Momentum is clearly evident in building in this area. \r\nLast month, we announced an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA in North America, where we are distributing their full line of products, including GPUs, helping users and partners to access AI-augmented applications, model training and development, professional graphics, engineering and digital twin applications. We were also honored to be recognized last week by the NVIDIA Partner Network as the Distribution Partner of the Year in the Americas and look forward to our continued partnership. \r\nAdditionally, we showcased our next-generation AI life cycle solutions from Hyve at NVIDIA's GTC AI Conference in San Jose last week. These products are tailored to the demands of AI data centers, hybrid cloud and edge deployments and include the design of liquid-cooled servers and racks. \r\nBeyond these accomplishments, we continue to execute on our goals to expand in the strategic technology areas and increase the value we bring to our partners. In our strategic technology areas, we experienced solid year-over-year growth in data, AI, IoT, cloud and security. Including Hyve, these technologies represented 23% of our total gross billings in Q1. \r\nUnderpinning these strong results are a multitude of programs and offerings designed to help our partners. To highlight a couple, first, we launched TD SYNNEX Cloud Labs as a solution aimed at accelerating the go-to-market process for our vendors. This virtualized environment facilitates proof-of-concept demonstrations that are flexible, scalable and cost efficient. This helps our vendors to bring solutions to market faster and more effectively. \r\nSecond, we continue to invest in our StreamOne platform, adding several new application programming interfaces, or APIs, and launched new professional services automation, or PSA connectors, particularly used by managed service providers and which provide an increased ease and synchronization of products, customers and order changes. We believe now more than ever that our organization is well positioned across both our core and strategic technology portfolios. The challenged market environment over the past year has provided us an opportunity to showcase the strength and resilience of our business model, portfolio and capabilities. \r\nDespite the headwinds in the market, we've pivoted to areas of growth and improved our business and margin mix towards strategic technologies and have also generated significant free cash flow, the majority of which we have returned to shareholders. We believe we have emerged even stronger from this period of market volatility and look forward to capitalizing on an improving IT spending environment, which we believe will allow us to deliver revenue growth, increased earnings per share and significant free cash flow generation, driving strong returns for our shareholders. \r\nI will now pass it over to Marshall so that he can provide additional details on our financial performance and outlook. Marshall?\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nThanks, Rich, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As Rich mentioned, we were encouraged to see an improving market environment with revenue and gross billings in line with our guided ranges. Additionally, our broad portfolio and progress on expanding in strategic technologies, allowed us to further improve our profitability with strong margins, healthy free cash flow, EPS growth at the upper end of our expectations and robust returns to shareholders. \r\nMoving to our fiscal first quarter performance. Fiscal Q1 total gross billings were $19.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year and in line with expectations, driven by a 7% decline in Endpoint Solutions and a 3% decline in Advanced Solutions. Net revenue was $14 billion, down 7.6% year-over-year. Gross-to net-revenue adjustments increased year-over-year due to the ongoing shift in our business mix and migration of a portion of Hyve's business to a consignment model. This negatively impacted our net revenue by 3% on a year-over-year basis but improved our gross margins by 23 basis points. \r\nAs we previously announced, starting this quarter, we are providing some enhanced data disclosures in our investor presentation. First, we are providing gross billings, net revenue and gross profit for the technology categories of Endpoint Solutions, which includes PCs, mobile devices, printers and peripherals; and Advanced Solutions, which includes cloud, servers, networking, storage, software and hyperscale infrastructure via our Hyve business. In addition, we are providing gross billings for our strategic technologies, which are cloud, security, data, AI, IoT and hyperscale infrastructure. Strategic technologies are primarily found in Advanced Solutions, but some categories are split into both Endpoint and Advanced Solutions. \r\nFor Q1, from a technology perspective, approximately 72% of Q1 gross billings were from hardware, 21% from software and 7% from services. As Rich mentioned, we were encouraged to see year-over-year growth in PCs as the market continues to stabilize. Non-GAAP gross profit was $1 billion and non-GAAP gross margin was 7.2%, up 52 basis points year-over-year due to a more profitable product mix and continued expansion in strategic technology areas, which also have higher gross-to-net adjustments. \r\nTotal adjusted SG&A expense was $581 million, up $13 million year-over-year as we continue to make balanced strategic investments supporting expected growth for the rest of fiscal '24. SG&A expense was down $11 million quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $425 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 3.04%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 11 basis points. Interest expense and finance charges were $76 million, $10 million worse than our outlook due to higher-than-expected borrowings. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23% and in line with our forecast. Total non-GAAP net income was $266 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.99, at the upper end of our guidance range, driven primarily by outperformance on margins due to improved mix. \r\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1 billion and debt of $4 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 2.3x and net leverage was 1.7x, in line with our investment-grade credit rating. We are currently assessing our debt structure ahead of our upcoming $700 million senior note maturity in August of this year, and our current intention is to refinance some or all of that debt prior to its maturity. Accounts receivable totaled $8.9 billion, down from $10.3 billion in the prior quarter; and inventories totaled $7.1 billion, down slightly from the prior quarter. \r\nFor the first quarter, net working capital was $3.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion in quarter 4; and the cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 2 days from quarter 4. Cash from operations in the quarter was $385 million, and free cash flow was $344 million. We returned approximately 68% of free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter through $199 million of share repurchases and $36 million in dividend payments. \r\nAs Rich mentioned, with our newly announced share repurchase authorization of $2 billion, we now have $2.2 billion authorized for further share repurchases. For the current quarter, our Board of Directors has approved a dividend of $0.40 per common share, representing a 14% increase on a year-over-year basis, which will be payable on April 26, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 12, 2024. \r\nNow moving to our outlook for fiscal second quarter. We expect non-GAAP billings of $18.4 billion to $19.6 billion, representing a growth of 1.5% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $14.9 billion, flat on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint. Our guidance is based on a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.09. \r\nNon-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $219 million to $263 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.50 to $3 per diluted share based on weighted shares outstanding of approximately 86.8 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $75 million and includes approximately $3 million of onetime interest expense and accelerated deferred costs associated with our anticipated debt refinancing. \r\nLooking forward to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, we would expect interest expense of $70 million in quarter 3 and $75 million in quarter 4. These estimates include the impact of our anticipated debt refinancing and expected working capital requirements. From a gross billings perspective, we continue to expect mid- to high single-digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by further improvement in the market environment. \r\nWe expect to generate approximately $1.2 billion of free cash flow for the fiscal year and remain committed to our medium-term capital allocation target of returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via both dividends and share repurchases, while remaining opportunistic on buybacks depending on market conditions. \r\nIn closing, our financial profile is strong and our resilient business model has enabled us to weather the volatile market conditions over the past several quarters, while continuing to generate strong free cash flow and robust returns to shareholders. We are working closely with our OEMs and vendors across both traditional and emerging technology growth areas and are seeing the benefits of our efforts to deliver enhanced solutions to our customers, positioning us well to capitalize on improving market demand over the next several quarters. \r\nWe are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\n\nAdam Tyler Tindle\n\nI wanted to start on the comments on PC optimism for the back half of the year. And maybe the question would be how that might manifest itself in results. So I think if I was to look at the past couple of years, the earnings weighting from the first half to the second half tend to be like 48% first half, 52% second half. Wondering if this year might be a little bit north of that 52% in the back half, given that commentary in PCs.\r\nAnd then secondly, just an update on the cost optimization. I think you had identified $50 million a couple of quarters ago. Just an update on the timing and what's reflected in results now.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nAdam, it's Marshall. Thank you for the question. In regards to the historical relation of first half, second half and your observation of being 48%, 52%, I think that's still fairly reasonable for this year. It may be a little bit heavier in the second half based on how we're forecasting acceleration and growth related to ES and AS in the second half of the year. \r\nOn cost optimization, on the $50 million, that did translate and take care of itself through quarter 1 of '24. So where would the capture, that $50 million, and it's embedded in our run rates going forward.\n\nAdam Tyler Tindle\n\nGot it. Okay. Maybe just a follow-up on the share repurchase authorization. You knew I would ask one on that, and congratulations on it. I think that $2 billion, if I went through my notes, it was about double the last authorization. So could you just speak to the discussion on the size of the repurchase and how to think about timing of deployment? Realized the long-term framework, but I wonder if that allows you to be a little bit more opportunistic.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nYes. Thinking about our medium-term cash flow objective of reaching $1.2 billion -- or $1.5 billion in free cash flow, and then looking at our capital strategy in terms of returns, about 50% of our free cash flow we anticipate returning back to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends. So Adam, if you think about what that looks like per year, it's around $500 million to $525 million. \r\nSo thinking about the $2 billion authorization, the reauthorization gives us that adequate coverage. For the next 2 to 3 years, it does allow us to be opportunistic. And in Rich's prepared remarks, we did -- he did mention that in addition to our free cash flow and our M&A and our reinvestment back in the business and our dividends and our mindfulness of leverage, if we find after that, that we have discretionary free cash flow to put back into repurchases, we may choose to do so.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of George Wang with Barclays.\n\nDong Wang\n\nI'd be remiss not to ask questions about AI. So two parts. Firstly, maybe you can double-click on the kind of AI data center-related build-out with the hyperscalers, specifically the Hyve segment. Maybe you can talk a little bit more how that's progressing and what sort of outlook going forward for the next few quarters on the Hyve segment.\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nSure. This is Rich. I'm going to go a little bit more broadly. So when we think about AI as an opportunity for our business, we would anticipate that it's going to be a positive in every segment from the AI PC to a traditional infrastructure with infused AI capabilities, obviously, to the software portfolio, which we're already seeing today with deployments of Microsoft Copilot as an example. And then certainly, within our Hyve organization as well. \r\nAs you know, we've had traditional data center deployments, but we do see a mighty shift, if you will, towards AI-oriented build-out. So we would anticipate that moving forward. A good part of the mix in Hyve will shift into that AI sort of classification. So we're confident with regards to our organizational capabilities and really see it as a great opportunity as we move through the next 5-plus years.\n\nDong Wang\n\nOkay. Great. Just a quick follow-up on the AI PC. You kind of alluded to shipment starting from midyear. Just maybe you can give a little bit of color just in terms of your expectations for the ASP uplift associated with the AI PC. Also, how do you envision kind of the AI PC shipment to grow as a percentage of total of shipments within your portfolio? Maybe you can kind of give some color on those [potential].\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes, sure. So as we understand in the marketplace, the PC vendors will be emerging with their AI offering at the mid of this year into the back half of this year. Certainly, we would think that, that sort of element alone will be a net up as it relates to the ASPs for the PC segment. We anticipate AI-enabled offerings to be more expensive from an ASP perspective. \r\nAnd then in the last quarter, I had talked about AI PC is maybe being a single-digit percentage of the market -- of the total PC market in the back half of this year versus total PC but then growing quite mightily as we move through '25 and '26.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan.\n\nJoseph Lima Cardoso\n\nI guess just first one from me, just another quarter of gross margin expansion, really impressive. I think it's seven now in a row on a sequential basis, and that's despite expectations for mix to be a bit of a headwind. Can you maybe just dig into that a little bit further around the margin outperformance, particularly like what was the surprise this quarter? And then as we look forward, particularly with PCs expected to recover, like how should we think about the potential pressures there on the margin side for the remainder of the year? And like what are the potential offsets that maybe we were not thinking of? \r\nAnd then maybe I'll just throw in a quick follow-up. Can we just get an update around the new large customer in Hyve? I think there was a delay last quarter. Just curious in terms of how that ramp is tracking and how we should think about the ramp in magnitude through the course of fiscal '24?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nThanks for the question or questions. Let me try and unbundle them one at a time. When we think about our margin profile improving as we sort of have moved through time, I'd like to offer a couple of thoughts. So the first one is when we think about our management system, we have the sellers across the organization really sort of aligned on delivering profitability. So our -- the sales incentives that we have in place, the systems that we have in place really afford us the opportunity to make sure that the whole organization is focusing on what's important. \r\nThe second thought that I would give you, and we've been transparent and will continue to be so on this fact, as we move through time there, we're moving more towards products which are netting. So we get a natural uplift in the margin profile. I think Marshall, in his prepared remarks, said it was worth 23 basis points this past quarter. So that's something that exist because of the accounting situation. And it's another reason why we want everybody to be focused on gross billings as we move through time because we would anticipate that, that netting is going to continue moving forward. As you know, we've got a big focus on strategic technologies and a good lion's share of that portfolio just netted. \r\nThen on the customer question that you had overall -- or let me back up. I missed one. On the -- what we should anticipate going forward, yes, we've had the benefit of a heavier Advanced Solutions, and you can see in the segmented results that we had -- the pro forma results that we had included in the financial information that Advanced Solutions has a more attractive gross profit margin. \r\nSo we will see a remixing of the portfolio moving through time and almost by just the math, it would say that we'll trade off some margin as we have a heavier weight in the portfolio towards Endpoint Solutions. And obviously, the guidance that we provide going forward have an expectation relative to what that mix would be. And then lastly, the new customer at Hyve is up and ramping and things are executing as anticipated.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nJoe, I'd just add a little bit of color to where we saw some good news in the quarter, and you'll see this in our press release where we break down the regional results. Europe had quite a bit of strength in their OI margin and OI profile on a non-GAAP basis. You can see both Americas and Europe on a gross billing perspective were down about 5%, but the margin profile was quite strong. So there are some suppliers and partners that performed or outperformed our expectation and then strategic technologies in general performed well in the quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\n\nMatthew John Sheerin\n\nRich, I wanted to just follow up on the PC commentary. I'm hoping that you can help us understand which end markets are you seeing -- starting to see year-over-year strength and which ones are lagging, for instance, SMB versus public sector versus enterprise and how you see that playing out? \r\nAnd the second part on the domain front, on the Advanced Solutions, I know you're up against tough comps last quarter, this quarter. You had a lot of backlog that you worked down. And the concern is that this digestion period, and we're going to be in a tougher year-over-year comps for the next couple of quarters or so. So how do you see that playing out as well?\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nI'm going to go first. This is Marshall, Matt. Thanks for the questions. I'll handle the second question about demand and let Rich talk about the PC side of things. But on demand, you're right. We called out that quarter 1 was going to be a tough year-over-year comparison, specifically in Europe as there was quite a bit of backlog that did play through. Quarter 2, we start to see it lighten up a little bit. I think March might be the last big month. But April and May, I think we're going to see some better compares. \r\nSo I think that the backlog is at profile. I think it's been there for a few months, maybe even a couple of quarters now. So the digestion is through that. And I would say the growth rates and how they manifest themselves going forward, probably in Q2 and beyond, will be less impacted by backlog. \r\nWith that all said, I think as we start to see growth, I wouldn't be surprised to see some working capital needs as we get in front of some of the buys that we expect that we're going to need to ensure that our vendors and our customers are taking care of in the second half of the year.\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes, Matt, on the PC question, remember, we had a very modest growth in Q1. As we think about quarters 2, 3 and 4, we see that growth expanding as we had said in our previous dialogue. And I kind of see it as an all boats rising right now when I think about the different dimensions of commercial, SMB, public sector, retail. There is no one area that is sort of outpacing the other in a significant way, but rather sort of a rising tide across the portfolio. Now obviously, that might change moving forward, but that's kind of what we're seeing right now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nYou spent a lot of time on PCs. Maybe can we pivot to sort of the more AI-centric product categories going forward as well, server, storage and networking? How are you seeing the demand environment today? Obviously, a lot of companies have posted relatively soft results. And how do we think about that in the context of your second half billings commentary regarding mid-single digits to double-digit growth? \r\nAnd then I just have a follow-up question. On the model, should we expect sort of the same dynamic from a margin spread perspective on these products, if they are AI sort of centric or AI-enabled products versus where we are today from more of a traditional legacy data center footprint perspective?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes, sure. So obviously, early days in AI, but maybe I'll double back on some comments on where we see things emerging. So first of all, on Microsoft Copilot, on our launch week, we had more than 2,000 partners engaged. And if I fast forward the current day, that has more -- dramatically more than doubled. So that, I'll call it, the software category is off and running. We've got a -- had a great launch. There's a lot of market excitement around AI software and Copilot, in particular. \r\nThe second, we talked about being sort of a full-service distributor for NVIDIA, and we were fortunate to be named their distribution partner of the year in the Americas. So there is a component aspect that is beginning to emerge that is also quite interesting. \r\nThird, from some of the more traditional OEMs that focus within the server category, we see the emergence of some larger deployments, the larger than normal in all of the markets throughout the world. So this might be an end-user customer who has an oversized demand of servers with GPUs in them. So we see that beginning to emerge. \r\nAnd then, of course, as we said earlier, in our Hyve business which serves the hyperscalers, there's going to be a natural transition in that content, less traditional data center, more towards the AI sort of configured systems. So all of this is sort of building. \r\nAt the same time, I think that we're going to be very focused on making sure we provide clear definitions for how we think about AI and what counts when we articulate particular sales numbers, et cetera. So that's work to do in the coming quarter or 2, which we'll make sure we provide. \r\nThen the last part is more of a general statement in terms of what we've experienced in the past with new technologies. Typically, new technologies come into the channel with a higher-margin profile than our average. And that's largely because the OEMs or the vendors want to help lead us to where they -- what they think is strategically important. So they typically enhance the margin profile. They also recognize that within there, we're going to have to be building skills and capabilities and services, which have some incremental costs and expenses associated with them. \r\nSo at this point, it's early innings on AI. I can only talk about what we've seen in the past with new technologies. And that's kind of the way we think about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vincent Colicchio with Barrington Research.\n\nVincent Alexander Colicchio\n\nYes. Rich, most of my questions have been answered. Curious about your expectation for acquisition revenue synergies for the year. Has there been any change there?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes. Let me talk about the acquisition, and I'll let Marshall talk about the revenue synergies here in a moment. So from an acquisition perspective, we continue to work a wide and robust pipeline of areas that we are interested in. Ideally, we look for opportunities that will allow us to enhance or accelerate our strategic focus areas. \r\nWe've talked in the past about the fact that within Europe and Asia Pacific, Japan, our market position is a little bit lighter than it is within North America, in particular. So those are attractive areas to us as well. \r\nWe're patient. We look for the right match, and it could come in the form of what we -- what the market sometimes calls tuck-in acquisitions. But we do see opportunities to improve our portfolio going forward. So Marshall, over to you.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nOn the revenue synergies, Vince, a few things to think about. So certainly, cross-selling is underway. As you know, the common platform in North America or in Americas regarding CIS is predominantly completed, so that's very helpful. It's difficult for us to quantify this early in the cycle. But certainly, we're seeing TAM associated with the vendors and customers who were complementary to emerge, begin to show benefit and gain traction. So we're seeing a lot of expansion in these complementary vendors, but it's still somewhat early to isolate and call that out. \r\nWhat we will do is as we can see that margin -- or excuse me, that market expansion grow in those vendors, we'll speak to it where it's meaningful. \r\nI think the other thing to keep in mind, too, is with our global footprint, we are starting to see complementary vendors and vendors that were coming across both organizations, utilize the global footprint to expand beyond what they currently had with the separate entities.\n\nVincent Alexander Colicchio\n\nAnd then maybe one more. How rapidly do you expect the expanded relationship with NVIDIA to ramp?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nIt's really hard to tell. Obviously, it's an area that is very robust in the market. So we would intend, as we always do, to get our fair share, if not more. We feel really good about what we have to offer in terms of our capabilities and our specialization within those spaces. And we're optimistic that this is going to be a great market for the foreseeable future.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nJust two for me. First, thank you for the new disclosures on endpoint and advanced. My question was around the gross margins. Are the 5% and 9% a good way to think about the gross margins for those respective categories? Are there certain things that you would call out that might cause that gross margin to deviate? And do you have any qualitative color on the year-over-year performance on gross profit? And then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nMike, this is Marshall. Yes. Certainly, we're happy to provide these disclosures. Keep in mind that, that's on a net basis. So there's quite a bit of netting that happened certainly in the AS portfolio. There's a little bit in the ES. When you think about it on a gross basis, it's more around 6% gross margin for AS and 4%. We tried to show gross relationships from a billing perspective just because it ignores and removes the netting down. \r\nAs we think about the portfolio and specific into quarter 1, we were quite surprised about the strength of our margins on a gross billings perspective. And we talked about some of the reasons why that's the case. \r\nAs we go forward, and we talked about this in our prepared remarks, as ES continues to show signs of acceleration and expectation that, that should continue in Q2 and beyond, that should have some gross margin headwinds or some reductions in the area of, call it, 15 bps, maybe 20 bps that is on gross margin and also on op margin when you compare it to gross billings. So I know we're throwing gross and net around there a lot. \r\nBut takeaway is that Endpoint Solutions in quarter 2 probably has a little bit of a mix shift that should dampen some of our gross margin attributes. The last thing I'd say about that, Mike, is that, as you know, when we look at our margin profile, we also look at our return on working capital in both AS and ES support investments we make and the returns are quite healthy. They just have different attributes. \r\nIf you think about AS, it's a little bit of a lighter inventory touch because a lot of it is dropshipped into the customer site. Endpoint is a little bit heavier on the shelf, so we have to make sure that our working capital dynamics are supportive of that. Net-net, both makes sense but it does play out a little bit to a decline in our margin profile as we head into Q2 into the second half of the year.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nGreat. That's very clear. And then as a quick follow-up, I also really appreciate the disclosures around billings by category. Any kind of high-level thoughts around long-term mix or midterm mix of billings by product category? And just as a point of clarification, does the netting kind of solely fit in software and services? Or does it come through other categories as well?\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nYes, I'll start. So broadly stating across the portfolio circle, everything has a little bit of netting AS, of course, has more than ES, but even ES has some netting to it.\r\nIf you think about the categories that we've called out, software continued to show, call it, decent at or better than growth attribute. Services certainly is growing year-on-year. I'd say the rest of those categories is where we're seeing the decline, and I'll call it the supporting of the reduction in the year-on-year decline in revenue growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\n\nRuplu Bhattacharya\n\nThank you for the additional disclosures on billings and margins by product category. My first question is on billings. It looks like for Endpoint Solutions, billings were down 7% year-on-year. Was this as per your expectations? If PCs improved, were other items in this category down meaningfully from a billings standpoint? \r\nAnd Marshall, I think you had expected first half of '24 billings to be flat year-on-year. Looks like it's going to be down 1.5% to 2% year-on-year. So the question is, has anything changed on your expectation for full year billings? And should we still expect netted down items to impact 25%, 26% for the full year?\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nI'll address the second question first and then let Rich talk about the billings and the AS features. So you're right, that's pretty close. We were still within our range of outcomes for quarter 1, but towards the lower end of that. So with that outcome, if you think about what we guided, we're roughly about 2% below the midpoint of expectations. And playing that through to quarter 1, we're about 2% below what we originally thought. So you played that out for the first half, yes, it's about 1% to 2% overall decline in revenue, but still pretty close to where we had expected. So I wouldn't call it any meaningful shift. \r\nNow it's a matter of just how the recovery plays out. Quite possible we could end up catching up to that. But certainly, the expectation for the second half growth attributes for ES and AS, we still feel quite confident about.\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nSo Ruplu, within the category, the other segments would be mobile, components and peripherals, they were down. And I would tell you that relative to our expectation, some of the softness versus the midpoint manifested itself in mobile and components.\n\nRuplu Bhattacharya\n\nOkay. You also talked about starting to see AI-related demand. I guess my question to you would be, do you think spending on AI-related items like AI servers, could have a cannibalizing impact on some of the non-AI-related products? Have you -- I mean what's your thought on that? I mean do you think that AI is a separate category and a separate spend? Or do you think the overall spend remains the same and one cannibalizes the other?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nSo this is a personal opinion, and I need to characterize it is that AI will not be just the total increment up on the IT TAM. I believe that there are trade-offs that are made when new technologies emerge. Budgets don't immediately increment to handle this new category. \r\nI think that there can be some trade-off, Ruplu, between AI infrastructure and other components of infrastructure. Cannibalization is a very strong word, so I wouldn't state that, but I'd leave it at logical trade-offs. Everybody needs to run their enterprises, and they need to make sure that they have an up-to-date and solid infrastructure to support that business. \r\nAnd then in addition to that, taking a look at new value props associated within their enterprises for AI productivity. And that's the way I would think about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\n\nAnanda Prosad Baruah\n\nI guess, Rich, what's your view or what do you see as the potential for the AI participation to foundational impact the company's revenue growth rate in coming years? And can you even, I guess as a part of that context, speak to the potential for ASP mix-up from Hyve since I think in a lot of cases, those servers can be meaningfully more expensive than traditional cloud servers. But also hearing your enthusiasm around the NVIDIA relationship, the GPU TAM for NVIDIA is pretty tremendous also. I mean I would have thought maybe just the GenAI AI-enabled PC, ASP uplift did impact you guys. But it sounds like you're working a handful of angles here sort of as well. So just would love your thoughts there.\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes. So again, it's a personal judgment because it is early innings, but I think you're right, Ananda. When we think about this AI category, and we start to superimpose it on the traditional segments of IT, it's -- I think it's fair to conclude, at least at this point, that the configurations are going to be richer. By definition, the cost of some of the GPUs, which are in market are fairly material. And so therefore -- and by the way, when we think about a configuration to support an AI server to use that as an example, it generally is richer in market today. \r\nSo look, I agree with you. I think the AI PC, the infrastructure categories of AI will all provide an increment within the ASP for some period of time. And the same would be true for software. If you take a look at traditional software that was in market, now the AI-enabled versions, the ASP, if we use that word for software, is higher. So I think that as that whole AI category provides some growth in market, it is fair to say that relative to the legacy things that they've been characterized where they'll clearly help with higher-level ASPs.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\n\nKeith Michael Housum\n\nI appreciate the detail as well with endpoint devices and Advanced Solutions. As we look at the gross billing split, roughly 40-60 this quarter, can you give us a little bit of historical perspective, how does that usually range, I guess, as we kind of think about the business? Is it historically has been more of a 50-50 mix? Or is it then more trending to where we're at now? And how can we expect that this trend over the next year or 2?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes. I'm going to offer a thought while Marshall in the background is calculating in his mind how to respond to your question. So if you take a look at our balanced end-to-end portfolio where we show our different segments, when we were on this call about a year ago, we were talking about PCs being low 20%, right, of our portfolio. Now it sits at 16%. So there will be some recovery in that particular category, for sure, as we move through time. And this is why what Marshall talks about sort of a bit of a remixing of the margin and the portfolio as we move to the back half of the year. \r\nMy own personal speculation is that it's not going to sit at 16%. It probably is going to increment based on the recovery within that category. And so therefore, there will be some rebalancing of the endpoint and advanced in total. But Marshall, maybe you can provide that.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nYes. Keith, I just want to make sure, the question was how does AS and ES mix going forward?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes. Total.\n\nKeith Michael Housum\n\nYes. It's 40-60. Historically, has it been 50-50? And can it go up at 70-30? Or is it usually pretty range bound?\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nYes. So it's definitely region dependent. If you think about Americas, they tend to be a little bit more heavily weighted toward AS. Europe, a little bit more weighted toward ES. Again, that's kind of a historical commentary. APJ tends to be kind of down the middle, sometimes they're a little bit more heavier weighted to AS. So it does depend on the region, and it does depend on the trend. But currently, the mix is a little bit more in favor of AS today.\n\nKeith Michael Housum\n\nBut we shouldn't expect ES to get to like 60%, even at the higher PCs, right?\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nReally hard to tell, Keith. A lot of it is dependent on just acceleration and how we think -- how the second half will play. Our take is we like both, and we know that our vendors and customers need both and we have solutions both in many different ways to all our customer base. So kind of it all matters.\n\nKeith Michael Housum\n\nOkay. If I can just ask one more follow-up question. You guys used the word stable as well as improving when referring to the IT market demand. I don't want to parse words too closely, but it's kind of what we do, right? So as you kind of look at the rest of the year and you talk about improving demand, I guess, what sort of 2 or 3 factors that give you confidence that the market really truly is improving?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nWell, I think first is if you take a look at our sequential sort of year-on-year declines, they've been narrowing as we've moved through the last couple of quarters. That would be number one. \r\nNumber two is obviously, we are going to start to lap on those tough compares where there was a lot of backlog rundown that propped up AS last year, and we get to wrap on the PC category. So I would just say that the cycles sort of provide an opportunity or catch up. \r\nThird would be AI, as we talked earlier, is going to offer new demand in the market that hopefully we'll be able to take advantage of moving forward. And so those are some of the thoughts. \r\nI would tell you that there still is some volatility relative to our expectations in categories. Obviously, when we take a look at Q1, it was a little bit softer than we thought at the midpoint. And gross billings and revenue came towards the lower end of our expectations. So I feel comfortable that the market is going to continue to improve moving forward. So -- but I'm sure there'll be some shorts and longs along the way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAshish Sabadra\n\nJust to follow up on a few questions that were asked before around the demand. I was thinking about more from a spending environment, like how much of the mid- to high single-digit gross billing growth in the back half of the year is contingent upon the IT spending increasing versus some of the company-specific dynamics, some of those which you laid out earlier in response to earlier questions, but also the headwind from the consignment model coming off possibly by third quarter of this year? So how much of it is potentially you winning a greater wallet share of the IT spend versus the IT spend actually improving as we get through the year?\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes. So first, again, I'm going to repeat a comment that I had stated earlier. As we think about our future and having potentially a larger percentage or portfolio of things which are netted, gross billings are what we track and think about when we think about our productivity, et cetera. So that's an important feature. \r\nSecond is our stated strategy has always been to grow a little bit greater than the market. So we would anticipate that as we move forward, that we can maintain that sort of objective and hopefully be successful executing against it. So we're -- the net of the question is we hope to outgrow the market to some degree in the back half of the year.\n\nMarshall W. Witt\n\nAnd I would just add to that, Ashish, to Rich's comment about gross billings being a really important data point for us and your comment about consignment, we expect that gross versus net, which is highly correlated to our Advanced Solutions and strategic portfolio will probably continue. And so with that, it's very difficult to gauge accurately where net revenue may play out. \r\nWe certainly report to it, both a meaningful GAAP number, but the gross billings is why we continue to make that a focus point for us in terms of its growth rate and its relationships to SG&A and op income, et cetera.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.\n\nRichard T. Hume\n\nYes. First, thanks for everyone joining today. We really appreciate your interest in TD SYNNEX. We're proud of the quarter that we had just delivered, and I want to say thank you to our coworkers across the world who really made it a reality. They are on the ground every day executing and are focused on making sure that they provide the best service to our primary stakeholders of customers and vendors. So thanks to all of our coworkers. And I wish you all a great day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a nice day.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Billionaire Investor Stan Druckenmiller and Insiders Are Piling Into These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaire Investor Stan Druckenmiller and Insiders Are Piling Into These 5 Stocks.\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the most revered investors in the Wall Street. Druckenmiller, worth over $9 billion, is going long on AI as he believes AI could be as big and transformative as the internet. In June last year, the billionaire said that he does not believe AI is a bubble and that’s why AI was dominating his long portfolio. Druckenmiller almost always thinks long term and that’s the open secret behind his success. Earlier this year, in an interview with How Leaders Lead with David Novak, Druckenmiller advised investors never to invest in the present and instead keep the next 18-24 months in mind and try to imagine how the world would be in the future. These thoughts are reflected in the billionaire’s portfolio as well. Duquesne Capital, which Druckenmiller founded in 1981, bought a new position in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the last quarter of 2022, buying over 582,000 shares. Back then the contemporary generative AI boom was just getting started. Nvidia was trading at around $146 as of December 30, 2022. Today the stock is hovering around $926. As of the end of the last quarter of 2023 Duquesne Capital had a $306 million stake in the GPU company.  Nvidia is among the top picks of the fund, in addition to other big names like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).\n\nDruckenmiller Avoids \"Lazy Longs\"\n\nDruckenmiller isn’t a huge fan of portfolio diversification. He said during the interview that if you really believe in a company, you’d take “massive” positions in it instead of putting your money in hundreds of companies. He said legendary investors like Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and George Soros invest in a handful of companies they really like and believe in. Druckenmiller said instead of having “lazy longs” in your portfolio, if you put your money in just a few companies, you won’t get careless in the investing game.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we decided to see which stocks in Druckenmiller's portfolio are also seeing buying activity from corporate insiders. For that we scanned Druckenmiller's Q4'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks that saw insider buying activity over the past few months. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Abcellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake: $3,767,000\n\nCanadian biotechnology company Abcellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) ranks 11th in our list of the stocks billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller and insiders are buying. John Montalbano, a director at Abcellera Biologics Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ABCL) board, bought 10,000 shares of Abcellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) on November 8, 2023, at $4.46 per share. The transaction came just two days after the director had bought 20,000 shares of Abcellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) at $4.64 per share. Since the November 6 transaction till date the stock has gained about 2.68%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, billionaire Druckenmiller had a $3.8 million stake in Abcellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) via his hedge fund. A total of 15 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Abcellera Biologics Inc. (NASDAQ:ABCL) as of the end of last year.\n\nIn addition to ABCL, Druckenmiller also likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).\n\n10. Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake: $4,933,000\n\nCharles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW) is one of the stocks in billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s portfolio that saw insider buying. On August 17, Charles A. Ruffel, a director at the financial services company, loaded up on 833 shares of Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW) at $60.55 per share. Since then the stock has gained about 20%.\n\nSequoia Fund stated the following regarding The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“By way of example, consider the following holdings: Rolls Royce, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Elevance Health, Credit Acceptance, Capital One Financial, Liberty Broadband, and Ashtead. Each of these companies trades for a low double-digit, or lower, multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings per share, yet each of them is capable of compounding earnings per share at a double-digit rate. At year-end 2023, these holdings accounted for almost a third of the Fund’s capital. Additions in 2023 included Liberty Broadband, Charles Schwab, Elevance, and Capital One Financial.\n\nCharles Schwab is notable because the business and the stock both had a challenging year. The regional banking panic in the spring of 2023 created an opportunity for us to add to our position below $50 per share. Rising interest rates have impacted the business in ways both predictable and unpredictable, but the net result has been a crimping of earnings that will likely persist for another year or two. Critically, we do not believe any of these transitory dynamics pose, or ever posed, any existential risk to the business. Further, Schwab’s enviable, high-return franchise remains, in our view, entirely intact. If we are right on both these counts, we should generate an attractive return from the current stock price across a range of long-term interest rate scenarios.\n\nShares in Charles Schwab returned -16% last year, making it the Fund’s worst-performing stock. By holding steady in the down market of 2022, it was one of the Fund’s best-performing stocks that year. This reversal in stock performance reflects a realization that rising interest rates are not an unalloyed good for Schwab in the short run…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n9. Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake: $10,010,000\n\nLive entertainment and media company Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) ranks ninth in our list of the stocks both insiders and Stanley Druckenmiller were piling into.\n\nOn March 4, Sphere Entertainment Co.'s (NYSE:SPHR) CEO James L. Dolan snapped up 76,079 shares of Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) at $47.19 per share. Since then the stock has gained about 4% in value.\n\nDruckenmiller also likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).\n\nMcIntyre Partnerships stated the following regarding Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In addition, two long-held investments, GTX and MSGE/SPHR, had positive news during the year and were significant contributors to our overall gains. For MSGE/SPHR, the split of the two businesses proved to be a significant catalyst, with the combined company rallying ~75% last year. After the spin in the spring, I rotated the bulk of our investment from MSGE to Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR), as I thought MSGE was trading at a reasonable valuation while SPHR remained deeply discounted. Since then, SPHR has completed construction of the Las Vegas Sphere, which opened to broadly positive reviews, and SPHR has appreciated further. However, we have substantially reduced our investment in SPHR. I was comfortable owning MSGE in significant size due to its unlevered ownership of the Madison Square Garden arena, an iconic venue with stable cash flows and modest growth. After the split, SPHR has no ownership of the arena and is instead a riskier growth company, with significant upside potential but also higher odds of a miss. As a result, we retain a smaller position in SPHR. Looking forward, I remain bullish on the Las Vegas Sphere and believe additional sphere developments could be a significant catalyst, offset somewhat by my worries regarding refinancing the MSGN loan while SPHR is still bearing a great number of front-end loaded growth expenses.”\n\n8. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake: $10,220,000\n\nAmy Banse, who is a director at Adobe Inc's (NASDAQ:ADBE) board, bought just 40 shares of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) on June 21, 2023, at $492 per share. The director also bought 15 shares of Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) on January 5 this year at $567.03 per share. Since her first transaction Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares have gained about 4.6%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller had a $10.2 million stake in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE). The stock is a new arrival in the billionaire’s portfolio.\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n7. Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake: $20,073,000\n\nSara Grootwassink Lewis, a director at Freeport-McMoRan Inc's (NYSE:FCX) board, snapped up 4,000 shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) on May 12, 2023. Since then Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) shares have gained about 28%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX), a significant increase from 73 funds in the previous quarter.\n\n6. Option Care Health Inc. (NASDAQ:OPCH)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Stake: $49,060,000\n\nHarry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr. is a board member at home infusion therapy services company Option Care Health Inc. (NASDAQ:OPCH). The director bought 35,000 shares of Option Care Health Inc. (NASDAQ:OPCH) on February 26 at $31.55 per share. Since then through March 25 the stock has gained about 4.5%.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Billionaire Investor Stan Druckenmiller and Insiders Are Piling Into These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n12 Cheapest Stocks in Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2024 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Love These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "The Uranium Bull Market Is Just Getting Started",
        "content": "Last year I interviewed several thought leaders about uranium, and I have to say that I’m a fan from a long-term perspective as the quest for cleaner fuel alternatives intensifies. A single uranium pellet outperforms traditional energy sources in electricity generation. We simply can’t move toward a green future without uranium.\n\nNow of course, I don’t recommend holding physical uranium in your basement. Might be a bit of a hazard honestly.\n\nBut what about holding uranium companies as true investments? There are several great companies out there, and the macroeconomic tailwind should push the entire industry higher over time. Nations are grappling with the need to reduce carbon emissions and navigate the energy crisis exacerbated by geopolitical tensions. The operational landscape of nuclear reactors is expanding, with 438 reactors currently active and 58 under construction. This growth is predominantly led by countries like China and India, reflecting a significant pivot toward nuclear energy in the global energy mix.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupply-side bottlenecks, however, such as the time required to restart idled mines and access to essential materials, present challenges. These factors, along with geopolitical considerations, have pushed uranium prices higher, with them nearly doubling over the past year and rendering previously unprofitable mines viable once again.\n\nMarket analysts forecast an average supply deficit of 35 million pounds per year over the next decade due to the lengthy lead time for new mines, which can be up to 15 years. When you combine this with the demand for uranium, it’s a powerful story. The World Nuclear Association estimates that uranium demand will rise from 65,650 metric tons in 2023 to nearly 130,000 metric tons by 2040.\n\nCameco Set to Shine in a Uranium Bull Market\n\nCameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is the biggest player here currently. You can tell that by looking at popular uranium mining ETFs like Global X Uranium ETF (NYSEARCA:URA) where CCJ makes up over 21% of the fund. The company has a market capitalization of $18.13 billion, and I think there’s a lot of room to grow. Why? Because frankly I don’t see any way to live in the AI future without a ton more electricity, which uranium can supply, and which Cameco would benefit from in terms of demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nCameco’s strategic positioning in the uranium sector is robust and undeniable. The company’s extensive mineral reserves and diversified supply sources, alongside its significant role in the nuclear fuel cycle, underscore its potential as a strategic investment in the face of increasing populations, electrification, decarbonization, and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nThe compound effects of a global shift toward sustainable energy, augmented by geopolitical dynamics and the challenging supply-demand equation, set the stage for a promising future for uranium investments. Cameco long term has the potential to be uranium’s equivalent of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), and while the stock has done well, it still looks to me like a compelling long-term allocation. It may not be Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but it sure is needed to power all those Nvidia chips over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Gayed did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "SK Hynix plans to invest approximately $4 billion to establish an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, marking a significant step towards bolstering America’s semiconductor industry. This investment aligns with the Biden administration’s goals to reestablish the U.S. as a semiconductor powerhouse.\n\nLocated near Purdue University, known for its extensive semiconductor and microelectronics-engineering programs, the facility will likely generate between 800 – 1,000 jobs, with a combination of state and federal incentives expected to support the project’s financing, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nAlso Read:South Korea’s Semiconductor Surge: Samsung and SK Hynix Shatter Records with Unprecedented Production and Shipment Growth\n\nOperations will likely begin in 2028, contingent upon SK Hynix’s board approval.\n\nAs a significant player in the global semiconductor market, SK Hynix’s decision to expand its operations in the U.S. reflects the company’s success in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) sector, where it serves as the exclusive partner to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) for its most advanced graphic-processor units.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia bagged HBM supply for 2024 GPUs with billion-dollar payments to SK Hynix and Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU).\n\nMeanwhile, geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China intensified as the former slapped a semiconductor embargo on the Asian counterpart, restricting the import of niche artificial intelligence technology from the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nRecent reports indicated China retaliated with new guidelines to eliminate U.S. microprocessors from Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD in government computers and servers, favoring domestic technology.\n\nAlso Read:Samsung Takes Steps To Revamp Chip Manufacturing To Align With Nvidia’s AI Requirements: Report (UPDATED)\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Nvidia Supplier SK Hynix to Launch $4B Semiconductor Facility in Indiana, Aims to Revitalize US Semiconductor Manufacturing originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence furor gripping the stock market has the shares of chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. soaring, making them increasingly crucial to the broader S&P 500 Index rally. But the stocks are no longer cheap, adding a new level risk to further gains in the broad equities benchmark.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People Trump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Vital Baltimore Bridge Collapses After Being Struck by Ship After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction\n\n“We like large-cap chip stocks, but their multiples are way too expensive right now, which will leave the broader US stock market even more susceptible to a selloff,” Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital, said in a phone interview.\n\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index is priced around eight times sales, the highest in at least two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500, by contrast, is priced around 3 times sales. Relative to the broader benchmark, the chip index is higher than it was during the dot-com peak in 2000.\n\nNvidia, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. account for about a third of the benchmark’s gain this year, as traditional leaders like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have lagged behind. That’s given chipmakers, which now make up more than 10% of the S&P 500’s weighting, an unprecedented amount of sway over the index.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, with regular boom and bust cycles. Chipmakers have struggled to meet short-term swings in demand with long-term levels of production capacity, which can cause periods of oversupply and shortages. At the moment, the industry is in a boom as companies rush to buy chips to bolster AI computing power. But it’s unclear how long that will last.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Of course, the outlook on chip stocks is positive, but they’re kind of like a toddler that’s getting hand-me-down clothes,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, whose firm is neutral on tech, with just minor exposure toward chip shares. “It’s going to take awhile for them to grow into the assumptions that are already being priced into these stocks.”\n\nNvidia’s revenue is projected to rise 81% in its current fiscal year, but just two years ago its sales were flat. Micron’s revenue dropped by nearly half from fiscal 2022 to 2023, when the maker of memory chips lost more than $5 billion. AMD, whose rally has been based on unproven expectations for its AI chip, lost money as recently as 2016.\n\nThat kind of volatility is a far cry from the usual technology darlings, like Apple, whose steady sales and profitability have made it a popular destination for investors seeking reliable capital returns and safety.\n\nMeanwhile, the stocks keep getting more expensive. Lofty valuations are a key reason Miramar’s Wasserman trimmed exposure to Broadcom in recent weeks, opting to book profits since the stock had ballooned in the firm’s portfolio.\n\n“Traders think these stocks are just going to keep going up forever,” Wasserman said. “Nvidia and Broadcom are great companies, but at some point this gets ridiculous. Traders need to take a step back and ask themselves ‘what is my risk versus reward for these chip stocks at their current prices?’”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China AI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn’t Classified Jokes, Pop Music and Radical Honesty: How TikTok Is Changing Home Sales Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "The Blockchain Bull Run: 3 Stocks You Need to Grab for Life-Changing Gains",
        "content": "The blockchain bull run is on. Surging crypto prices, from Bitcoin (BTC-USD) to a series of altcoins, have reignited investor interest in many digital assets. From blue-chip blockchain stocks central to the crypto movement to the most speculative meme coins, investors of all stripes are looking at assets many may have never thought would be on their radar.\n\nOf course, there are a myriad of ways investors can gain exposure to this high-growth movement. Investing directly in cryptocurrencies is certainly the most straightforward path. Then, there’s the option to buy spot and futures-based ETFs, made possible by recent SEC approvals. Or, one can choose to invest in crypto-related stocks.\n\nThese three companies may fit the profile of investors looking to strike it rich in this crypto bull market. Be warned — investing in these stocks carries higher than average risk. However, these blockchain stocks may be worth looking for for those willing to stomach the volatility.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) offers exposure to the growing crypto market without picking individual altcoins. Despite ongoing SEC disputes, COIN stock more than tripled over the past year, driven partly by surging crypto valuations. Transaction volumes have surged as crypto prices took off. And given that’s where Coinbase earns the vast majority of its revenue and profits, it’s been game on for this crypto stock.\n\nJMP analyst Devin Ryan reiterated a Market Outperform rating for setting a $300 target. Ryan recognized Coinbase’s growth potential beyond a cryptocurrency exchange. He noted rising spot-trading volumes, indicating growth opportunities as the market matures.\n\nIn other positive news around this centralized crypto exchange, Coinbase Derivatives, a branch of the U.S.-based exchange Coinbase, plans to launch cash-settled futures for Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), Litecoin (LTC-USD) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) by April 1. Based on Dogecoin’s persistent popularity, the move awaits approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe self-certification method allows Coinbase Derivatives to proceed pending regulatory compliance. As more tokens get added to this centralized exchange and the project expands its business lines to futures contracts and other derivatives, investors could benefit (as long as this surge continues).\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. MARA stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) is a leading Bitcoin miner focused on generating revenue by turning its massive hoard of computing power into Bitcoin. Like other Bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital’s price performance has been volatile in recent years, generally moving alongside Bitcoin’s price movements. However, a recent decoupling between the two, tied to Bitcoin’s upcoming halving, has caused some investors serious concern.\n\nThat’s because mining rewards will be cut in half in roughly three weeks. Thus disrupting Marathon Digital’s entire business model (at least from a margin perspective) unless Bitcoin doubles in value and quick.\n\nMany Bitcoin bulls believe this to be the case. If such a surge materializes, MARA stock may be very attractively valued at current levels. The company has strengthened its cryptocurrency mining presence with a $87.3 million acquisition of a 200-megawatt Bitcoin mining data center in Garden City, Texas, emphasizing sustainability and operational control.\n\nThis marks its second major expansion in four months, increasing self-owned and operated megawatts to 54% and aligning with its strategy to reduce costs by approximately 20% at the site. If margins improve alongside Bitcoin prices, this speculative stock could take off in the coming months. It’s a gamble but one many Bitcoin maxis may be willing to make.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt this point, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is truly the semiconductor and AI chip king, and the company is not stopping anywhere in the competition.\n\nAt its GPU Technology Conference, Nvidia unveiled the GB200 chip, powering the Blackwell B200 GPU, surpassing the H100 AI chip with significant performance and efficiency enhancements. With 208 billion transistors, the B200 GPU delivers 20 petaflops of FP4, outperforming the H100 by 30 times in LLM inference workloads while reducing energy consumption by 25-fold. In GPT-3 LLM benchmarks, the GB200 performs seven times faster than the H100. Training a model with 1.8 trillion parameters requires only 2,000 Blackwell GPUs, consuming just 4 megawatts, compared to 8,000 Hopper GPUs and 15 megawatts.\n\nSuch chips will likely play a key role in driving the future of AI applications both in the conventional sense and on-chain. Several blockchain-based AI projects are popping up, ready to take advantage of the incredible surge in interest in this space.\n\nAs the backbone of everything AI, investors can gain indirect exposure to growing AI application development in the crypto world by buying this stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is leaving no stone unturned to bolster its generative AI capabilities on the back of its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which has been its key growth driver. Shares of Amazon have gained 83.3% over a year.\r\n\r\nThe latest partnership with a South Korean AI startup called Upstage is a testament to the same.\r\n\r\nAs part of the deal, Upstage launched its small language model (SLM) called SOLAR MINI on AWS. It has also selected AWS to train SOLAR MINI with the help of Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nSOLAR MINI is capable of performing various language tasks in Korean and English. The tasks include understanding, summarizing, translating and predicting new content.\r\n\r\nThe model eliminates the requirement of training generative AI models from scratch, thus enabling customers to get started with generative AI seamlessly.\r\n\r\nAs SLMs are lightweight compared with LLMs, SOLAR MINI is well-equipped to run the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions at lower costs, given a training dataset of 10.7 billion parameters.\r\n\r\nNotably, SOLAR MINI is available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart and AWS Marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe underlined collaboration is expected to aid AWS in gaining strong traction among enterprises of all sizes across various industries like entertainment, healthcare, research, e-commerce and education.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon’s Growing Generative AI Efforts\n\nIn addition to the Upstage deal, AWS recently extended its collaboration with NVIDIA NVDA to power its portfolio with the generative AI technology.\r\n\r\nThe NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform, which was introduced at GTC 2024, will be available on AWS. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAWS strives to enable customers to explore new generative AI capabilities by delivering secured and advanced infrastructure, software and services. In this regard, AWS will offer NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs. AWS also intends to provide Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, backed by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU.\r\n\r\nApart from this, AWS offers Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nThe company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.\r\n\r\nAWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAWS’s solidifying prospects in this promising market are expected to continue aiding its performance. Moreover, its expanding portfolio will drive its customer momentum, which, in turn, will likely aid its dominant position in the cloud computing market, wherein companies like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google are also gaining steam.\r\n\r\nAmazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of the total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Stocks may have slipped on Mar 25 to begin a shortened final week of the first quarter but the S&P 500 is on track to post a price gain of almost 10%. The broader index has scaled up nearly 30% since its closing low on Oct 27 and surpassed its all-time high last week.\n\nSkeptics have, thus, started to question whether all the positive news is already priced in the market. Many of them believe that the S&P 500 is due for a pullback, thanks to the over-extended rally, while most of the stocks listed in the index have become expensive.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 has, time and again, registered gains in the rest of the year following a solid first quarter. Jefferies noted that since 1970, whenever the S&P 500 has notched average gains of 2.5% in the first quarter, it has tended to beat its average second-quarter gain of nearly 2.6% by 60 basis points, or 0.6%. And if the S&P 500 can gain more than 10% in the first quarter, the second quarter gains are even more encouraging, averaging 3.3%.\n\nFurthermore, chief investment strategist Sam Stovall at the CFRA said that strong first-quarter performance since 1945, or the end of the Second World War, has always resulted in superb full-year gains. This time around, the stock market is well-poised to continue its winning streak, banking on AI optimism and the Federal Reserve’s assurance of three interest rate cuts later this year.\n\nHigh-growth players, including tech stocks, are witnessing their shares move upward by leaps and bounds as AI has resulted in several technological headways. AI integration has led to an increase in labor productivity and financial growth for countless tech firms (read more: 3 Solid AI Stocks Worth a Look for the Rest of the Year).\n\nThe Fed, meanwhile, has kept interest rates unaltered in its latest policy meeting and has reiterated that it’s sticking with its prediction of a series of interest rate cuts soon. Rate cuts no doubt bode well for the economy vis-à-vis the stock market as it increases consumer spending and reduces borrowing costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumers, anyhow, remained resilient on the back of a strong labor market despite sticky inflationary pressure and decreasing pandemic savings (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain on Signs of Household Spending Resilience).\n\nThus, with fears of the recession on the ebb and the stock market expected to continue its growth trajectory, it’s judicious for astute investors to place bets on stocks that not only gained traction in the first quarter but also are well-poised to scale northward along with the broader market.\n\nThese stocks are American Eagle Outfitters AEO, Abercrombie & Fitch ANF, Cimpress CMPR, Dianthus Therapeutics, Inc.

        "title": "Vertiv Holdings and JinkoSolar have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 26, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Vertiv Holdings Co VRT as the Bull of the Day and JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. JKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on ARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR ARM, Li Auto LI and Vulcan Materials VMC.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nVertiv Holdings Co stock has doubled Nvidia over the last 12 months, driven by Wall Street’s insatiable appetite for AI-boosted growth.\n\nVertiv is not as flashy as Nvidia and other artificial intelligence darlings. Yet Vertiv’s portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services could grow steadily for decades because AI and other technological advancements require practically endless, always-available data.\n\nVertiv’s job is to keep the computing power needed to drive the modern, digitally connected economy running as smoothly as possible around the clock.\n\nVRT provides investors the opportunity to benefit from the AI-super cycle without picking artificial intelligence winners since Vertiv is a high-tech picks and shovels-type AI investment.\n\nVRT’s Pitch: The World Runs on Big Data\n\nThe rapid rise of cloud computing, AI, cryptocurrencies, and cutting-edge technologies yet to come all require an increasingly enormous amount of data and energy. Vertiv’s pitch to potential customers and Wall Street is straightforward and compelling: “The world depends on the data we power and cool.”\n\nVertiv’s portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services operates across data centers, communication networks, commercial and industrial facilities, and beyond. Vertiv’s product categories include critical power, thermal management, racks & enclosures, and monitoring & management.\n\nThe Ohio-based firm's services range from DC power and electrical reliability to safety and compliance. Vertiv’s clients include enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses across healthcare, telecom, tech, retail, education, and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertiv expects the push for greater energy efficiency across data centers will boost its liquid cooling technologies since more traditional air-cooling systems cannot as effectively cool new high-density racks jam-packed with CPUs and GPUs.\n\nVertiv is expanding inside the pre-fabricated/modular data industry, as data centers proliferate globally. Meanwhile, its micro data centers offer all-in-one solutions for power, cooling, monitoring, and racks.\n\nVRT in December agreed to acquire liquid cooling infrastructure solutions firm CoolTera, bolstering its ability to support the deployment of AI at scale. Plus, Vertiv partnered with AI chip superstar Nvidia ((NVDA) to help solve future data center efficiency and cooling challenges.\n\nThe firm’s nearly two dozen global manufacturing plants are helping it ramp up production. Vertiv said last year that its “existing footprint was built with the idea that future growth would need to be accommodated.”\n\nGrowth Outlook\n\nVertiv, which went public via a SPAC in early 2020, posted 14% revenue growth during its first two full years. VRT grew its revenue by 21% in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company's organic orders climbed by 23% in Q4 and it closed the year with a record backlog of $5.5 billion. CEO Giordano Albertazzi sees “tremendous opportunity ahead as the data center needs of AI drive additional market demand.”\n\nVertiv is projected to post 11% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and nearly 10% higher sales in FY25 to climb from $6.86 billion last year to $8.34 billion next year.\n\nVRT’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 33% and 24%, respectively. Vertiv is also boosting its adjusted free cash flow, which helps support the acceleration of its long-term capital deployment framework.\n\nVertiv’s post-Q4 release EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and mark the continuation of its improving bottom line outlook over the last year.\n\nVRT’s FY24 consensus EPS estimate has jumped 80% over the last year from $1.31 a share to its current $2.35 per share, while its FY25 figure has soared by 112% ($1.38 to $2.92 per share).\n\nPerformance, Technical Levels & Valuation\n\nVertiv shares have surged by 325% during the last three years to outpace the S&P 500’s 31% and the Zacks Technology sector’s 35%. VRT has skyrocketed roughly 530% during the last 12 months to double Nvidia and blow away Tech 48%.\n\nVertiv trades solidly above its 21-day and 50-day moving averages, driven by a 72% YTD climb. VRT might be overheated in terms of RSI levels, and some investors might want to wait for a pullback.\n\nThat said, playing the market-timing game is not easy and can prevent long-term investors from buying great stocks at prices that could look like steals down the road even if they prove a tad pricey in the near term.\n\nVertiv trades at a discount to its Computers - IT Services industry at 33.2X forward 12-month earnings vs. 36.1X. That is solid bang for your buck since VRT has climbed 325% in the last three years vs. its industry’s 12% run.\n\nVertiv’s PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 1.2. This represents a 60% discount vs. its industry, 36% value vs. the Zacks Tech sector, and an 8% discount to Nvidia.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWall Street is bullish on Vertiv, with nine of the 10 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.” VRT appears worth considering as a way to gain exposure to the never-ending growth of data and, of course, the AI age.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nJinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. is one of the largest solar panel manufacturers in the world. JinkoSolar shares have tumbled alongside most of the solar industry over the last few years amid higher interest rates, tough-to-compete-against periods of expansion, and other headwinds.\n\nJKS fell way short of our Q4 earnings estimate on March 20 and provided disappointing guidance.\n\nJinkoSolar Basics\n\nJinkoSolar makes various types of solar panels for different aspects of the market. The company sells residential rooftop solar panels, as well as high-performance systems for localized industrial and commercial energy production.\n\nJinkoSolar benefited greatly from the Chinese government’s efforts to boost solar panel production in the country. JinkoSolar’s vertically integrated manufacturing process has helped it lower the costs of producing complicated, high-tech PV panels.\n\nSolar went on a tear during Covid, spurred by government incentives, lower rates, and more. JKS expanded greatly since 2019, soaring from roughly $4.27 billion in sales to around $16.62 billion in fiscal 2023.\n\nStill, JKS posted adjusted fourth earnings of $1.21 a share, missing our estimate by 47%. Worse yet, JinkoSolar’s downbeat guidance forced analysts to slash their earnings outlooks.\n\nJinkoSolar’s first quarter consensus plummeted from +$2.10 a share before its March 20 release to a loss of -$0.44 per share. JinkoSolar’s FY24 consensus EPS estimate tumbled by 47%, with its FY25 outlook 30% lower.\n\nJinkoSolar’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. “As module prices fell more than expected in the fourth quarter and nearly 50% of our modules were sold to the Chinese market at lower prices, gross margin for the fourth quarter decreased significantly to 12.5% from 19.3% in the third quarter,” CEO Xiande Li said in prepared remarks.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJinkoSolar could be a long-term winner. The solar industry might be nearing a bottom because interest rates have likely peaked. Plus, solar is still projected to grow alongside the wider energy transition.\n\nThat said, JinkoSolar stock only performed well during the Covid boom. The stock is down 22% over the last 10 years. All in, it might be best for investors to stay away from JKS until it proves to Wall Street that a turnaround is on the horizon.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nGlobal Week Ahead: Two Big IPOs in Europe and the PCE in the U.S.\n\nIn the Global Week Ahead, inflation signals from the United States, Australia and Japan are a key focus, for bond and stock traders alike.\n\nThis follows a deluge of central bank meetings last week. Ones that included a historic Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike.\n\nThis week, Sweden's Riksbank could add to drama around who cuts rates. Now that Switzerland has kicked off easing among big central banks.\n\nFinally, Europe's IPO wheels are turning.\n\nNext are Reuter’s five world market themes, reordered for equity traders:\n\n(1) This Week, Two of the Biggest European IPO’s in the Last 12 Months Happen.\n\nThe launch of two of the biggest European initial public offerings (IPOs) of the last 12 months is in traders' sights.\n\nThe market wants some equity market success to unlock a vital cog in the financial system and spur more dealmaking.\n\nCVC's perfume retailer Douglas raised around 850 million euros ($922.93 million). It priced its shares at bottom of an indicated range. They plummeted more than 12% on their debut on Thursday.\n\nBut skincare company Galderma (GALD), opens new tab priced its 2.3 billion swiss franc ($2.56 billion) IPO at the top of an indicated price range and soared on its first day trading Friday.\n\nA good performance might help other companies follow suit, including CVC itself.\n\nThat should help release pressure building on private equity firms needing to exit investments, return capital and deploy funds.\n\n(2) On Friday, watch out for the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE). The Fed’s preferred inflation measure lands.\n\nA March 29th U.S. inflation reading is critical for markets after the Federal Reserve stuck with a view for rate cuts this year, even with a stronger economic outlook.\n\nThe February Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index is expected to show a +0.4% monthly increase, according to a Reuters poll. January's PCE index rose +0.3%, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in three years.\n\nThe Fed just upgraded its view on inflation - projecting that the PCE index excluding food and energy would rise at a +2.6% annual rate by year-end, compared with +2.4% in its December projections. It also lifted 2024 economic growth estimates.\n\nAny suggestion in the data that inflation is picking up could dash hopes that Fed easing will start soon, with a go-slow approach likely to continue.\n\n(3) What Other Moves Come from the World’s Central Banks?\n\nTraders love a bit of excitement, and there has been plenty lately - a BOJ rate hike and a surprise Swiss cut.\n\nThe Swiss move, plus the Bank of England (BoE)'s hint at easing, means it is game on for June rate cuts from other big central banks.\n\nData and central-bank speak in coming days will be watched closely.\n\nThe question is the U.S. Fed. It is sticking with a plan for three rate cuts for now, but strong data and sticky inflation could derail that.\n\nWhere does that leave investors? They favor government bonds in Europe and selling currencies where rate differentials with the Fed are opening up.\n\nNo surprise that the Swiss franc slumped after Thursday's SNB cut and even the buoyant U.K. pound took a knock from a dovish BoE.\n\n(4) In Asia-Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Sets Monetary Policy.\n\nJust as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) thought inflation was finally coming to heel and the time was ripe to tone down its tightening bias, blowout employment figures have delivered a nasty shock.\n\nThe RBA will likely watch Wednesday's inflation print for any upside surprises, given February's data will capture more price changes for a range of services - which has been declining at a slower pace than for goods.\n\nAcross Asia, any further easing of inflation in Singapore and neighboring Malaysia is unlikely to significantly sway policymakers, who are expected to keep monetary policy unchanged for some time.\n\nTokyo's consumer price figures caps off a data-light week for Japan on Friday. That may be met with less excitement given that the Bank of Japan, has finally now hiked rates for the first time in 17 years.\n\n(5) In Europe on Wednesday, Sweden’s Central Bank, the Riksbank, Sets Policy.\n\nSweden's central bank, the world's oldest, is expected to keep its key rate unchanged on March 27th. But it could announce that a cut, the first since it began tightening policy in spring 2022, is nearing.\n\nHeadline inflation has slowed to near the Riksbank's 2% target and growth has ground to a halt as households and businesses struggle with rates at over 15 year-highs.\n\nIn February, the central bank said rates had peaked and that it could even start to ease policy in the first half of 2024.\n\nRate-setters remain worried, however, about the risks of setbacks - particularly the chance of a weaker Swedish crown if the Riksbank gets out of step with the ECB and U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nAs a result, markets see a first rate cut in May or June.\n\nTop Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks\n\n(1) ARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR: This is a $133 stock in the Technology Services industry. The market cap is $135B. I see a Zacks Value score of F, a Zacks Growth score of C, and a Zacks Momentum score of F.\n\nArm Holdings plc (formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a British semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England.\n\nIts primary business is the design of central processing unit (CPU) cores.

The market cap is $35.9B. I see a Zacks Value score of D, a Zacks Growth score of C, and a Zacks Momentum score of A.\n\nVulcan Materials Company is engaged in the production, distribution and sale of construction aggregates and other construction materials in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nThe company has four operating segments: Aggregates, Concrete, Asphalt Mix and Calcium.\n\n• The Aggregates segment produces and sells aggregates like crushed stone, sand and gravel and other aggregates.

Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix.\r\n• The Concrete segment deals with the production and sale of ready-mix concrete in various US sates. This segment functions as a customer of the Aggregates segment, as aggregates are a major component in ready-mix concrete.\r\n• The Calcium segment produces calcium products for the animal feed, plastics and water treatment industries with high-quality calcium carbonate material.\n\nKey Global Macro\n\nFriday’s core PCE data, and Jerome Powell’s speech, are top market-moving events.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. new home sales for FEB should be 0.673M, rising from a prior month’s 0.661M.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. durable goods orders for FEB come out. Ex-defense orders should be up +1.0%, following a -7.3% prior monthly print in JAN.\n\nOn Wednesday, the influential Fed Governor Chris Waller speaks.\n\nOn Thursday, traders get to review the 2nd revision of U.S. Q1 real GDP growth.

        "title": "Nvidia Traders Find Reasons to Worry Beyond Sky-High Stock Price",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s runup since the start of 2023 has been so sudden and strong that even bullish investors are raising concerns about how much room its shares have left to run.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest People Trump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Vital Baltimore Bridge Collapses After Being Struck by Ship After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction US CEOs Extend China Stay on Last-Minute Invite to Meet Xi\n\nThat’s what a 550% gain since the start of last year will do to even the sturdiest of bull cases. While Nvidia’s profit and revenue growth are real, and sentiment on Wall Street remains overwhelmingly upbeat, runups of this magnitude tend to capture years of profit growth that haven’t yet been delivered. The stock has become one of the largest in the world, adding $2 trillion in value over the past 15 months.\n\nA move such as this pulls “forward many years of future returns in a very condensed period of time,” according to Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. Fundamentals take a back seat and trading becomes fraught, he added.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s head start in artificial intelligence chips looks formidable, there are reasons for caution beyond the basic math of share surges. Here are some of the main arguments:\n\nDemand\n\nNvidia is benefiting from an arms race among companies rushing to boost computing power to run AI workloads. The chipmaker’s revenue doubled in its last fiscal year and is projected to rise another 81% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWhile there are few signs that demand is slowing, the semiconductor industry is notorious for its boom and bust cycles. Throughout its five-decade history the business of chipmaking has consistently struggled to match long-term introductions of production capacity with short-term swings in demand, causing gluts and periods of shortages.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh-end chips such as Nvidia’s processors take in excess of a quarter to make and must be ordered from manufacturers months in advance. That makes forecasting a precarious game that companies haven’t always got right.\n\nRead More: Nvidia ‘Bubble’ Talk Spreads to ESG Investors Who Rode Highs\n\nAt the end of 2023, four firms — Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. — accounted for over a third of Nvidia’s revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain estimates. A slowdown in buying by these big data center owners would result in a revenue hit for Nvidia and a recalibration of growth estimates that would likely roil the stock.\n\n“Right now the demand is there for Nvidia, in terms of Microsoft and Alphabet and Amazon all wanting to build out their AI infrastructure,” said Jeffrey Muhlenkamp, portfolio manager at Muhlenkamp & Co., who doesn’t hold Nvidia on valuation concerns. “If they can’t turn that around and make that capex profitable, there won’t be a second round of spending.”\n\nBulls argue that this is just the first wave of buying for AI chips and that the next spending surge will come from other industries such as drug makers, shipbuilders and carmakers, as well as governments.\n\nCompetition\n\nWith Nvidia’s profit in fiscal 2024 hitting nearly $30 billion, the competition is rushing to get a piece of the action. Nvidia’s nearest rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. launched it’s AI-accelerator late last year and is forecasting revenue of as much as $3.5 billion this year from that area. Intel Corp. has its own range of AI chips and customers including Microsoft and Amazon’s AWS have their own internal chip design efforts.\n\n“Nvidia’s margins are so high it just begs for competitors to come in,” said Logan Purk, the Edward Jones analyst who cut his rating on Nvidia to hold from buy in November. “Nvidia has done a fabulous job establishing a moat, especially with its software business, but everyone wants a piece of this space.”\n\nRead More: Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nLast week, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang unveiled a new chip design - the successor to the firm’s all conquering H100 product. When asked about his competition, Huang stressed that he’s not just offering chips, he’s providing networking and all of the software needed to rapidly deploy AI data centers. Huang characterized Nvidia’s competition as having a mountain to climb and analysts largely agreed.\n\nPrice Action\n\nNvidia’s booming profits have kept a lid on its stock market valuation, but its price-to-profit ratio is on the rise again. The stock is trading at 37 times profits projected over the next 12 months, up from about 25 times at the start of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nLots of comparisons have been made between Nvidia’s rise and the dot-com era, when stocks like Cisco Systems Inc.’s soared on a similar thesis — buy the pick and shovel makers in a gold rush.\n\nOne of the biggest lessons from that bust was that even though an investor might be right about which companies will prevail, the price at which you pay for a stock is even more important.\n\nCisco’s annual profit has more than quadrupled since the stock peaked in 2000, but its shares are still down by nearly 40%.\n\n“Whenever there is a craze and people get excited, expectations always come in so high that they are bound to disappoint,” said Brad Lamensdorf, co-manager of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nFormer president Donald Trump’s social media startup is rising ahead of its first session as a publicly traded company after the most high-profile blank-check deal in years. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. gained as much as 30% in premarket trading Tuesday after completing a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. is calling off an initial public offering for its Cainiao logistics arm, shelving a much-anticipated debut that could have raised more than $1 billion. Adam Neumann and several partners submitted an offer to buy WeWork out of bankruptcy for more than $500 million, putting one of the tech world’s most controversial founders a step closer to regaining control of his long-troubled startup. Atos SE gave itself until the week of April 8 to present creditors with a refinancing framework as it aims to head off a looming repayment crisis. China’s efforts to counter the downbeat narrative about a structural slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy got a boost from enthusiastic endorsements from chief executives of top global companies. Carlyle Group Inc. is considering options for Indian information technology firm Hexaware Technologies Ltd., including an initial public offering that could raise $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nTD SYNNEX GDS Holdings Postmarket\n\nnCino Progress Software\n\n--With assistance from Ian King and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China Spies Can Rent Coworking Spaces With Cappuccino and Kombucha on Tap Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "title": "Could Micron Technology Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the market's hottest chip stocks. The chipmaker was originally known for making gaming GPUs, but the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market over the past few years drove more companies to purchase its high-end data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks.\n\nNvidia's rally of more than 2,000% over the past five years boosted its market cap to $2.4 trillion and minted a lot of millionaires. But it's also driving more investors to search for the next big chipmaker that could follow Nvidia's footsteps. Image source: Micron.\n\nCould that chipmaker be Micron(NASDAQ: MU), one of the world's top producers of DRAM and NAND memory chips? Let's review the key differences between Micron and Nvidia to see if Micron has a shot at replicating Nvidia's gains.\n\nThe key differences between Micron and Nvidia\n\nMicron designs its memory chips and manufactures them at its own foundries. That makes it different from Nvidia, which designs its chips but outsources its production to third-party foundries like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Micron operates that capital-intensive model at much lower margins than Nvidia. NVDA Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nMicron's memory chips also cost a lot less than Nvidia's GPUs, and it doesn't dominate its core markets in the same way as Nvidia. Micron is the world's third-largest supplier of DRAM chips and the fifth-largest supplier of NAND chips, but Nvidia is the leading producer of discrete GPUs by a wide margin. According to JPR, Nvidia controlled 80% of the market at the end of 2023, while AMD only held a 19% share.\n\nCompared to Nvidia, Micron operates in a more commoditized market, has less pricing power against its competitors, and is more exposed to cyclical downturns as the memory chip market goes through its boom-and-bust cycles. However, Micron still produces denser and more power-efficient DRAM and NAND chips than its two largest competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix. That technological edge helps Micron lock in producers of higher-end PCs, mobile devices, and servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow long will the next growth cycle last?\n\nMicron endured a rough slowdown over the past two years as personal computer (PC) shipments declined in a post-pandemic market, the 5G upgrade cycle ended, and the macro headwinds curbed its chip sales to the enterprise and industrial markets. The Chinese government also barred its key infrastructure providers from buying Micron's memory chips. All of those challenges offset its stronger growth in the automotive and AI markets.\n\nMicron's revenue grew 29% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in September 2020), but only rose 11% in fiscal 2022 and tumbled 49% in fiscal 2023. However, analysts expect its revenue to rise 56% in fiscal 2024 and 43% in fiscal 2025 as three tailwinds kick in. First, the PC and smartphone markets should gradually stabilize. Second, it should sell more chips to the enterprise, industrial, and automotive markets as the macro environment warms up again.\n\nLastly, the explosive growth of the generative AI market will drive more data centers to upgrade their memory chips alongside Nvidia's GPUs. During Micron's latest conference call, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the memory chip market was still in \"the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI\" and that those technologies would transform \"every aspect of business and society.\" As an example, Mehrotra predicted that AI-enabled phones would \"carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non-AI flagship phones today.\"\n\nBut another cyclical downturn is inevitable\n\nThat's a bright outlook, but Micron's new growth cycle will still likely end in a few years. That's because companies drive up memory prices by buying a lot of chips when a certain market -- like smartphones, cloud data centers, and AI -- runs hot.\n\nIn response, Micron and its peers usually ramp up their production of new chips to satisfy that demand. But once the hot market cools, the chip shortage quickly turns into a supply glut as companies are left with an excess inventory of chips. That's why Micron's chip sales fell in 2019 and 2022 -- and why they'll likely drop again once the AI market matures.\n\nThis next growth cycle could last a lot longer than previous ones, but it will eventually end in a downturn. Nvidia will also face a similar slowdown, but its cyclical declines have been much milder than Micron's over the past decade. That's because Nvidia's dominance of the discrete GPU market grants it more pricing power during market downturns -- while Micron remains heavily exposed to the price cuts at its larger competitors.\n\nCan Micron become the next Nvidia?\n\nMicron's stock trades at less than 4 times next year's sales, and it could run higher as its next growth cycle begins. If its valuations hold steady and it grows its revenue at a CAGR of 30% over the next five years, its stock could nearly quadruple. That would be an impressive gain, but it could end in a cyclical downturn and won't come close to replicating Nvidia's gains over the past five years. Simply put, Micron is still a promising semiconductor play -- but it's probably not the next Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Are Considerably Cheaper Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend has changed the corporate landscape more than the advent of the internet. However, the arrival of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution may give history a run for its money.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be delegated to humans. The incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to \"learn\" over time and become more proficient at their tasks, is what ultimately gives AI utility in practically every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock has soared thanks to the AI revolution\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In the span of a little over one year, it's become the foundational-infrastructure play in high-compute data centers. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for a greater-than 90% share of GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia is still in the process of ramping its production. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which should help ease supply chain issues for Nvidia and allow the company to meet more of its customers' orders.\n\nBut when things seem too good to be true on Wall Street, they usually are.\n\nIn addition to contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own to either complement or replace Nvidia's data-center infrastructure. Even if Nvidia is able to maintain some degree of advantage(s) over these in-house GPUs from its top customers, future orders from these four businesses are liable to taper.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia finds itself at risk of cannibalizing its own gross margin as it expands production. The reason data-center sales more than tripled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) is because of GPU scarcity. Demand was so strong for its A100 and H100 chips that the company was able to dramatically increase the price of these units. As Nvidia's GPU production, and that of its competition, increases, industrywide GPU scarcity and Nvidia's pricing power should wane.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the most damning factor of all might be Nvidia's valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget Nvidia: These two \"Magnificent Seven\" components are considerably cheaper\n\nThere are a number of ways to \"value\" stocks. While the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio works well for mature businesses, it doesn't do a particularly good job of valuing the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's largest and most influential businesses (listed in order of descending market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia  Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven businesses offer well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in their respective industries. They're also well known for reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth initiatives. That's why cash flow tends to be the best measure of value when analyzing Nvidia and its peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs of the closing bell on March 22, Nvidia was valued at just north of 30 times Wall Street's forward-year cash-flow estimates. That makes Nvidia the priciest stock within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe good news for investors is that two other Magnificent Seven components with artificial intelligence ties are historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking by opportunistic investors.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube, among other ventures.\n\nAccording to Wall Street's consensus cash-flow forecasts, Alphabet is expected to generate more than $11 in cash flow per share in 2025. Based on its closing price for March 22, this places Alphabet at roughly 13.5 times forward-year cash flow. Not only is this less than half the multiple Nvidia trades at, but it represents a roughly 24% discount to Alphabet's price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nThe operating segment that makes Alphabet tick is Google. In February, Google registered a 91.6% share of worldwide internet search, according to GlobalStats. It's sustained at least a 90% monthly share of global search dating back nine years. Being the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s), it suggests Google should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut it's Alphabet's cloud-infrastructure service platform, Google Cloud, which offers the most promise in terms of cash-flow growth. Google Cloud accounted for a 10% share of global cloud-infrastructure service spend during the September-ended quarter, and this segment delivered its first year of profits in 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also where Alphabet has many of its artificial intelligence tie-ins. It's allowing customers to use generative AI solutions to build applications within the cloud that can improve customer interactions and/or help businesses better target consumers with their advertising.\n\nEnterprise cloud spending looks to be in its early stages of ramping up, which suggests double-digit sales growth can continue for the higher-margin Google Cloud.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven member that's a considerably cheaper AI stock than Nvidia is none other than e-commerce titan Amazon.\n\nDespite hitting a fresh 52-week high last week, Amazon ended March 22 at a multiple of only 13 times Wall Street's estimated forward-year cash flow. This represents a 43% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period, and it's markedly lower then Nvidia's multiple-to-forward-year cash flow.\n\nMost consumers are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online retail platform. The company's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year, which was more than 31 percentage points above its next-closest competitor.\n\nBut dig beneath the surface and you'll find that online retail sales generate low margins and don't contribute much to Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Rather, the company's ancillary operating segments, which include Amazon Web Services (AWS), subscription services, and advertising services do most of the heavy lifting.\n\nWhereas Google Cloud accounts for 10% of global cloud-infrastructure service spending, AWS sits at the top of the pecking order with a 31% share, according to estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Similar to Alphabet, Amazon is deploying generative AI solutions in a multitude of ways within its cloud platform to allow users to build applications. On an annualized run-rate basis, AWS is generating nearly $97 billion in sales and is consistently responsible for most of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon's other ancillary segments aren't slouches, either. Luring more than 2 billion unique users to its website each month has fueled ad sales for Amazon. Likewise, it crossed above 200 million monthly worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of the National Football League for Thursday Night Football.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bull of the Day: Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT)",
        "content": "Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT) stock has doubled Nvidia over the last 12 months, driven by Wall Street’s insatiable appetite for AI-boosted growth.\n\nVertiv is not as flashy as Nvidia and other artificial intelligence darlings. Yet Vertiv’s portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services could grow steadily for decades because AI and other technological advancements require practically endless, always-available data.\n\nVertiv’s job is to keep the computing power needed to drive the modern, digitally connected economy running as smoothly as possible around the clock.\n\nVRT provides investors the opportunity to benefit from the AI-super cycle without picking artificial intelligence winners since Vertiv is a high-tech picks and shovels-type AI investment.\n\nVRT’s Pitch: The World Runs on Big Data\n\nThe rapid rise of cloud computing, AI, cryptocurrencies, and cutting-edge technologies yet to come all require an increasingly enormous amount of data and energy. Vertiv’s pitch to potential customers and Wall Street is straightforward and compelling: “The world depends on the data we power and cool.”\n\nVertiv’s portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services operates across data centers, communication networks, commercial and industrial facilities, and beyond. Vertiv’s product categories include critical power, thermal management, racks & enclosures, and monitoring & management.\n\nThe Ohio-based firm's services range from DC power and electrical reliability to safety and compliance. Vertiv’s clients include enterprises and small and medium-sized businesses across healthcare, telecom, tech, retail, education, and beyond.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv expects the push for greater energy efficiency across data centers will boost its liquid cooling technologies since more traditional air-cooling systems cannot as effectively cool new high-density racks jam-packed with CPUs and GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertiv is expanding inside the pre-fabricated/modular data industry, as data centers proliferate globally. Meanwhile, its micro data centers offer all-in-one solutions for power, cooling, monitoring, and racks.\n\nVRT in December agreed to acquire liquid cooling infrastructure solutions firm CoolTera, bolstering its ability to support the deployment of AI at scale. Plus, Vertiv partnered with AI chip superstar Nvidia (NVDA) to help solve future data center efficiency and cooling challenges.\n\nThe firm’s nearly two dozen global manufacturing plants are helping it ramp up production. Vertiv said last year that its “existing footprint was built with the idea that future growth would need to be accommodated.” Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Outlook\n\nVertiv, which went public via a SPAC in early 2020, posted 14% revenue growth during its first two full years. VRT grew its revenue by 21% in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company's organic orders climbed by 23% in Q4 and it closed the year with a record backlog of $5.5 billion. CEO Giordano Albertazzi sees “tremendous opportunity ahead as the data center needs of AI drive additional market demand.”\n\nVertiv is projected to post 11% revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and nearly 10% higher sales in FY25 to climb from $6.86 billion last year to $8.34 billion next year.\n\nVRT’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 33% and 24%, respectively. Vertiv is also boosting its adjusted free cash flow, which helps support the acceleration of its long-term capital deployment framework. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv’s post-Q4 release EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and mark the continuation of its improving bottom line outlook over the last year.\n\nVRT’s FY24 consensus EPS estimate has jumped 80% over the last year from $1.31 a share to its current $2.35 per share, while its FY25 figure has soared by 112% ($1.38 to $2.92 per share).\n\nPerformance, Technical Levels & Valuation\n\nVertiv shares have surged by 325% during the last three years to outpace the S&P 500’s 31% and the Zacks Technology sector’s 35%. VRT has skyrocketed roughly 530% during the last 12 months to double Nvidia and blow away Tech 48%.\n\nVertiv trades solidly above its 21-day and 50-day moving averages, driven by a 72% YTD climb. VRT might be overheated in terms of RSI levels, and some investors might want to wait for a pullback.\n\nThat said, playing the market-timing game is not easy and can prevent long-term investors from buying great stocks at prices that could look like steals down the road even if they prove a tad pricey in the near term. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVertiv trades at a discount to its Computers - IT Services industry at 33.2X forward 12-month earnings vs. 36.1X. That is solid bang for your buck since VRT has climbed 325% in the last three years vs. its industry’s 12% run.\n\nVertiv’s PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 1.2. This represents a 60% discount vs. its industry, 36% value vs. the Zacks Tech sector, and an 8% discount to Nvidia.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWall Street is bullish on Vertiv, with nine of the 10 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.” VRT appears worth considering as a way to gain exposure to the never-ending growth of data and, of course, the AI age.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investing in Innovation: 10 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best tech and disruptive ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the tech landscape, head over to Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nHigh inflation, rising interest rates, and global uncertainties, resulting in softer consumer spending, reduced product demand, market capitalization declines, and workforce reductions made headlines in 2022. These headwinds continued into 2023, with a slight decline in global tech spending and increasing layoffs. Nonetheless, economists are now less concerned about the risk of recession, with analysts optimistic about modest growth potential in the tech sector for 2024. Despite ongoing global and economic uncertainties, Deloittesuggests that it is time to refocus on innovation and growth. Their 2024 technology industry outlook identifies key trends and strategies expected to shape tech leaders' priorities, including (1) Aiming for a comeback with support from cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity technologies; (2) Balancing globalization with self-reliance to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical unrest, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory changes; (3) Preparing for growth opportunities with generative AI applications; and (4) Addressing regulatory challenges as governments worldwide assess the impacts of tech platforms on businesses and consumers.\n\nKen Englund, EY Americas TMT Leader, commented:\n\n“In 2023 the tech industry navigated global economic headwinds and geopolitical tensions, while building widespread expectation around the potential of AI. The opportunity for the year ahead is clear. By putting AI at the center of their strategies, tech businesses could leapfrog competitors who were previously ahead, not only by accelerating their transformation journeys but also repositioning operations to capitalize on rapidly emerging technologies and business models.”\n\nSimilarly, Olivier Wolf, EY-Parthenon Global TMT Leader, siad:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Notwithstanding regulatory hurdles associated with AI deals, huge potential remains. The platform nature of today’s tech businesses means there will be many attractive companies with business models based on existing AI ecosystems. The optimal way to expand will be through a blend of small- to medium-sized acquisitions, corporate investments and partnerships, that will help companies access intellectual property and the skills needed to develop new propositions quickly.”\n\nIn 2024, the technology market offers numerous promising opportunities, including the rapid expansion of the Asia Pacific region, high demand for software, the potential of generative AI, and the increasing focus on green and digital innovation. Economic conditions are expected to improve with lower energy prices, stabilizing supply chains, and decreasing inflation. Forresterforecasts global tech spending to reach $4.7 trillion in 2024, marking a 5.3% growth compared to 2023's 3.5%. The IMF's World Economic Outlook highlights the Asia Pacific region as a leader in growth, with India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and China expected to see significant real GDP growth in 2024. India, a major exporter of technology services, is projected to experience a 9.5% growth in domestic and government tech spending. In China, the digital economy is anticipated to contribute 41.5% to GDP. North America is forecasted to grow by 5.4%, with financial services and healthcare leading tech spending growth. Software and IT services are expected to dominate US tech spending, capturing 60% by 2027. The US government is allocating $25 billion to emerging technologies in 2024 through initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act agencies. Europe is expected to grow by 5.1%, rebounding from a challenging 2023. However, further acceleration of tech spending is needed to meet digital technology enterprise targets.\n\nForrester advises companies to prioritise investments in software, generative AI, and green and digital innovation. Software revenues, including custom and off-the-shelf solutions, are projected to grow at double-digit rates, fueled by robust demand for cloud services. Investments in generative AI software are forecasted to increase by 36% annually through 2030, reaching $227 billion, with major players like Microsoft and Google Cloud experiencing significant revenue growth in this domain. Large consulting firms are pivoting towards AI solutions delivery, with firms like Capgemini planning multi-billion-dollar investments in generative AI. Partnerships between generative AI companies and hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle facilitate access to computing power. Additionally, companies are urged to focus on green and digital innovation, as initiatives like Europe's Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact aim for carbon neutrality in data centers by 2030. Innovative firms investing in green and digital initiatives experience accelerated revenue growth, while increased digital technology investment leads to enhanced productivity growth.\n\nCathie Wood's Latest Thoughts on Innovation Investing\n\nCathie Wood is always mentioned when the subject on hand is innovation. In an interview last month with OPTO, Wood commented that the technologies that are making waves today, their roots were laid down 20 years ago, at the end of the Telecom bubble. She referred to multiomic sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, noting that these technologies are now ready for prime time, with growth rates ranging from 20%-50% per year. Cathie Wood expects a convergence of these five major technologies at one point, which will result in 'super exponential growth'. Already strong growth rates will speed up further, resulting in enormous productivity gains and potential for wealth generation. She stated that AI is a huge catalyst for productivity gains, and it is accelerating the efficiency of the other major market technologies. Wood also mentioned that robotics will lead to massive increases in productivity, especially humanoid robotics, as they take over dangerous and extremely mundane tasks from humans.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, robo taxis or autonomous taxi platforms are likely to experience the largest revenue boom as three technologies converge, which are robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. She highlighted that autonomous vehicles have a tremendous revenue opportunity of $8-$10 trillion globally over the next 5 to 10 years. In this context, she sees huge profit margins for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a platform provider for autonomous vehicles. Among the Magnificent 7, Wood sees positive outcomes for Tesla due to autonomous vehicles and Meta Platforms since it is well-integrated into the AI ecosystem and is big on social commerce. However, for Amazon and Google, Wood sees trouble since she noted that AI will disintermediate data aggregators at point. She further pointed out the boom in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, noting that Bitcoin rose 40% last year when Silicon Valley Banks and others banks collapsed. The SEC's green light with the crypto ETFs also helped the industry. This will also impact Coinbase positively in the long run, as per Cathie Wood. Coinbase is Wood's largest portfolio holding as of Q4 2023.\n\nSome of the top tech stocks to buy include Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue.

Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market.\n\nWith regard to Meta, the company’s “year of efficiency,” as 2023 was declared by Mark Zuckerberg, involved a recalibration of its spending plans to focus on profitability. While the stock also benefited from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, the re-rating in the price multiple seems entirely rational as shares were selling for less than 10X next year’s estimated earnings at its 2022 lows for a business that still had strong growth drivers, consistent free cash flow generation and a large net cash position. While Meta is included in the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks, Meta is trading much cheaper (~25X P/E) than all the others aside from Alphabet (~24X P/E), which is the one other of the Magnificent Seven stocks we hold. While Meta’s stock is no longer extremely cheap, we feel it is still reasonably priced for a good business with attractive growth prospects. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\n6. Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 20: 139.09%\n\nFranklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) is an actively managed fund aiming for capital appreciation through investments in companies advancing automation and task enhancement technologies.

As of March 19, 2024, Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM) holds net assets worth $20.08 million, featuring an expense ratio of 0.50% and a portfolio of 57 stocks.\n\nSemiconductor giant ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top holdings of Franklin Intelligent Machines ETF (CBOE:IQM). On March 11, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and other semiconductor equipment firms saw a boost in 2023 due to heightened demand from China, but potential domestic substitutions may impact future gains, according to Bernstein Research. Bernstein raised ASML's price target to $1,072 from $963 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), compared to 57 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 5 million shares worth $3.76 million.\n\nIn addition to Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best tech stocks to invest in.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Investing in Innovation: 5 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 States With the Most Federal Workers in the US 20 Biggest Energy Companies in Australia for 2024 Billionaire Steve Cohen and Insiders Are Buying These 10 Stocks\n\nDisclosure: None.

They're not cutting anything yet they just keep delaying it and the market is fine with that... but they're doing a good job right now of saving the bullets for when they need them.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 162.13 points, or 0.41%, to 39,313.77, the S&P 500 lost 15.97 points, or 0.31%, to 5,218.21 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 44.35 points, or 0.27%, to 16,384.47.\n\nEconomic data showed sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell unexpectedly in February after mortgage rates increased during the month. The underlying trend remained strong with a chronic shortage of previously owned houses on the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq held closer to unchanged for most of the session before fading late, as gains in chipmakers Nvidia and Micron Technology provided support. Nvidia rose 0.76% while Micron Technology surged 6.28% to a closing record of $117.04. Semiconductor shares were choppy, showing initial weakness after a report over the weekend said\n\nChina had introduced guidelines\n\nto phase out U.S. microprocessors supplied by Intel and AMD from government personal computers and servers.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index ended 0.34% lower, after alternating between gains and losses during the session. Intel ended down 1.74% and AMD closed 0.57% lower.\n\nExpectations for a Fed rate cut in June were again increasing, with markets now pricing in a 71.9% chance for a cut of at least 25 basis points (bps), according to CME's FedWatch Tool, up from around 54.7% a week ago.\n\nThe February reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday, when U.S. markets will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.\n\nA strong reading could jolt market expectations about the timing of a rate cut.\n\nBoeing rose 1.36% after announcing a broad management shakeup and said CEO Dave Calhoun would step down from his position at the end of 2024. But the planemaker finished off session highs.\n\nWalt Disney advanced 3.01% as the best performer on the Dow after Barclays upgraded the stock to \"overweight\" from \"equal weight\".\n\nOn the NYSE declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 1.4-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 1.4-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 113 new highs and 110 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 9.67 billion shares, compared with the 12.27 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Q4 Earnings Outperformers: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) And The Rest Of The Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks\n\nLet's dig into the relative performance of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q4 processors and graphics chips earnings season.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a solid Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 2.1% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 3.9% below consensus. Stocks have faced challenges as investors prioritize near-term cash flows, but processors and graphics chips stocks held their ground better than others, with the share prices up 12.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nInventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.\n\nIntel reported revenues of $15.41 billion, up 9.7% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 1.5%. It was a decent quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates. However, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations.\n\n“We delivered strong Q4 results, surpassing expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter with revenue at the higher end of our guidance,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO.

        "title": "More Than 86% of Analysts Who Cover These 3 Stocks Rate Them a ‘Buy’",
        "content": "Investors got a good case of whiplash over the past four years. The pandemic crash of 2020 brought a decade-long bull market to a screeching halt. However, the spin-up into the revenge-buying bull market of 2021 soon followed. A bear market followed again the next year, only to be gored by another bull run higher in 2023. We’re still in the midst of that today.\n\nThe benchmark index seems to set new records almost daily these days, and Wall Street fully embraces it. Analysts are much more upbeat, and their stock ratings reflect that outlook. Of the more than 5,600 stocks on the market, 15% have a Hold rating and less than 2% are rated a Sell. That means over 80% of all stocks are a Buy or better.\n\nThere is good reason stocks with high analyst ratings dominate the market. It’s because stocks tend to go up over time. Data from The Hartford Funds shows the average bear market lasts just 289 days or less than 10 months. Bull markets, on the other hand, tend to last for 2.6 years! Wall Street is simply playing the odds and betting on the American economy to keep growing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, experts are particularly excited about some stocks with high analyst ratings. The following three stocks have that kind of consensus. They are ones almost all analysts rate as a Buy or Strong Buy. Let’s see if that enthusiasm is warranted.\n\nMicron Technology (MU)\n\nBest known as a provider of DRAM and NAND memory chips, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is getting swept up in the artificial intelligence (AI) tsunami. It was the first chipmaker to ship advanced high-bandwidth memory called HBM3E, which provides more than 20 times the memory bandwidth standard D5-based DIMM server modules can. It also does it at 30% lower power consumption.\n\nThat’s key because generative AI models require an ever-growing amount of data as they scale. Micron’s second-generation HBM3E chip was among the first to be qualified for Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) updated H200 and GH200 accelerators, and the new Blackwell GPU architecture-based AI systems allocate 33% more HBM3E content.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra told analysts Micron sold out its entire HBM3E supply for 2024. Almost all of 2025’s supply is also gone. As it only just began recognizing revenue from the new chips in Q2, investors can expect to see sales explode in future quarters.\n\nThat’s likely why 92% of analysts have a Buy rating or better on MU stock. Shares spiked on the earnings news, but at less than 15 times next year’s earnings, Micron has plenty of growth still to come.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) Bud Light Beer 36 pack beer cans display at grocery store.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) continues to reel from its disastrous Bud Light marketing campaign. The controversial decision to step into the culture wars and alienate its core customer cost the brand not only its position as the best-selling beer but actually lost BUD stock $1.4 billion in sales.\n\nBud Light is now trailing Constellation Brands‘ (NYSE:STZ) Modelo Especial after giving up five percentage points of market share. Although the share losses have since stabilized, growth is barely occurring. Management admits the beer is only gaining 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points every 3 to 4 weeks. Fourth-quarter revenue was still down 17% from the weak year-ago figure, and sales to retailers (STR), a measure of consumer demand, fell 12% as the Bud Light fiasco hangover lingers.\n\nStill, Wall Street remains hopeful Anheuser-Busch will rebound. Some 88% of analysts rank the brewer a Buy or better. In large part, that’s due to the belief beer drinkers will trade down from ultra-premium brands as consumer spending weakens. As A-B still has a commanding presence in the premium market, it would stand to benefit most.\n\nMoreover, the brewer is a global company. While North America accounts for 15% of global volume and 25% of revenue, Central and South America combine to represent more than half of each, respectively. With significant growth prospects there and trading at just about 12 times free cash flow, BUD stock might warrant the upside potential Wall Street assigns it.\n\nDexcom (DXCM) Dexcom (DXCM) logo on an app store page on a mobile phone\n\nSource: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical device maker Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) is highly regarded for its continuous glucose monitors (CGM) for diabetics. It has long dominated the Type I diabetes market, where patients take insulin to keep their glucose levels in check. Yet, the Type 2 diabetes market is estimated to be twice as large because it is far more common. Patients may or may not need insulin injections.\n\nDexcom has a big opportunity to gain a large swath of the Type 2 market with its CGMs. The FDA just approved Dexcom for over-the-counter sales of its Stelo CGM for individuals who don’t take insulin. There is stiff competition in the CGM market from both Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Dexcom, though, could gain the lead.\n\nPresident and CEO Kevin Sayer told analysts that 70% of Dexcom’s CGM prescriptions already come from primary care physicians. It should be relatively easy for the medical device maker to see doctors now prescribe the Stelo to their diabetic patients who don’t take insulin.\n\nIt won’t be a straight moonshot for DXCM stock but Wall Street is on the right track with its Strong Buy rating. As 86% of analysts give Dexcom a thumbs up, the stock could continue growing even though it does carry a premium valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones Is Selling Microsoft Stock Hand Over Fist but Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire philanthropist Paul Tudor Jones is an iconic figure on Wall Street and has been called \"one of the pioneers of the modern-day hedge fund industry.\" He runs Tudor Investment, the hedge fund he founded in 1980.\n\nHis biggest claim to fame was predicting Black Monday, the famed stock market crash of 1987. Less than a year after his call, the market plunged more than 22%, marking the worst single-day decline since the stock market crash of 1929. Jones shorted the market, reaping a 200% gain for his hedge fund. So when Jones talks, Wall Street listens.\n\nThe billionaire investor has been quite vocal about the vast potential for artificial intelligence (AI). \"I do think the introduction of large language models [and] artificial intelligence is going to create a productivity boom that we've only seen a few times in the last 75 years,\" Jones said.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks all have AI in their DNA, so it isn't surprising that some of these market leaders would be among Tudor's top holdings. Interestingly, however, Jones just slashed his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), cutting its stake by 56%. Here are the AI-centric Magnificent Seven stocks he bought instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo discussion about AI stocks would be complete without Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), so it isn't surprising that Tudor increased his position in the chipmaker. In the fourth quarter, Tudor Investment boosted its stake in Nvidia by a whopping 810%, increasing its stake to 132,000 shares worth roughly $121 million (as of Thursday's market close). That makes Nvidia its third-largest position, at roughly 1% of the portfolio.\n\nThe chipmaker pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for processing AI applications. Nvidia dominates the market in both machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- and the data centers where much of the AI processing occurs, boasting an estimated 95% market share in each. Nvidia's long history underpinning AI made it the shoo-in to address the growing demand for generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitors were already scrambling to develop competing processors, but Nvidia cemented its lead last week with the release of its Blackwell architecture. Its flagship AI processor, the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, connects two B200 Tensor Core GPUs with a Grace CPU on a single board, acting as one giant processor. Big tech is already lining up to get its hands on the chips.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia generated record revenue that surged 265% year over year, while its earnings per share (EPS) soared 486% -- driven by accelerating demand for its AI processors. Furthermore, given the company's heavy spending on research and development (R&D) and track record of innovation, it will be difficult for rivals to gain ground.\n\nDespite the stock's recent run, Nvidia is still reasonably priced relative to its opportunity. The stock is currently selling for 36 times forward earnings, which is a steal given its triple-digit growth -- a fact that likely wasn't lost on Jones.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might not seem the most obvious choice in the AI space, but the company has a long history of using AI to further its business objectives.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Tudor Investment more than doubled its Meta Platforms holdings, increasing its stake to roughly 102,000 shares worth roughly $52 million (as of Thursday's market close). That makes Meta Platforms a top 15 position, at roughly 0.5% of the portfolio.\n\nOne of the more intriguing developments over the past year or so has been Meta's foray into large language models. The company developed one of the leading open-source AI models -- LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud platforms, providing the company with an entirely new revenue stream.\n\nMeta recently announced it is building an AI system that it says significantly improves its video recommendations. A test on Reels resulted in \"an 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,\" according to Facebook chief Tom Alison, which shows the new AI model is \"learning from the data much more efficiently than the previous generation.\"\n\nThe company also introduced a suite of AI-fueled tools to simplify the digital ad process for advertisers on its platform and help them better reach their target market. This will ultimately bolster Meta's fortunes, since the company makes the vast majority of its revenue from digital advertising.\n\nAt just 25 times forward earnings, Meta is selling at a discount compared to the S&P 500's valuation of 28 -- which likely factored into Tudor's decision.\n\nSmart moves?\n\nWhile I'm totally on board with Tudor boosting its stakes in Nvidia and Meta Platforms, I must admit to being completely mystified at its decision to cut its stake in Microsoft by half. The company has multiple ways to capitalize on the AI revolution.\n\nFirst, there's its growing suite of AI-fueled Copilots, which will likely be worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in incremental revenue. Second is the fact that Microsoft Azure is stealing market share from its cloud rivals thanks to its AI efforts. In my mind, those factors make Microsoft a buy, not a sell.\n\nI think Jones made a mistake in cutting its stake in Microsoft, but only time will tell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "20 Least Densely Populated States in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 least densely populated states in the US. If you would like to skip our discussion on the population trends in the US, you can go to the 5 Least Densely Populated States in the US.\n\nThe United States of America has the third largest population in the world, accounting for roughly 4.23% of the global population. The population density in the US stands at 36 people per square kilometer, which is considerably lower than densely populated countries like China and India. Population distribution across the US varies significantly. For instance, New Jersey and Rhode Island have population densities of 1263 and 1061.4 people per square mile, respectively, ranking them among the most densely populated states. Conversely, Wyoming is among the states with low population densities, at 5.9 people per square mile.\n\nTypically, Northeastern states like Massachusetts and Connecticut are densely populated, with population densities as high as 901.2 and 744.1 people per square mile, respectively. In contrast, Midwestern states and certain Southern states such as Mississippi, Kansas, Minnesota, and North Dakota tend to have lower population densities. This disparity is attributed to factors such as greater land availability, fewer urban centers, and more sparsely populated areas in these regions.\n\nUrban Population Dynamics\n\nLarge urban centers are more densely populated in the USA. According to the US Census Bureau, the overall population density of urbanized areas sits at approximately 2,534.4 people per square mile. This national figure, however, masks significant variations. Megacities like New York City have densities exceeding 27,000 people per square mile, reflecting a concentration of towering skyscrapers, bustling commercial districts, and limited land availability. Many major cities like Chicago and Philadelphia fall within a 10,000 to 20,000 people per square mile range, offering a balance between urban facilities and breathing room. In comparison, population densities in suburban areas can be significantly lower, sometimes dropping below 1,000 people per square mile.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the high population density in urban areas. One of these factors is the availability of job opportunities and the presence of popular companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Job growth is increasing in major US cities while the workforce is decreasing in rural areas. In fact, there has been a larger decrease in workforce participation in non-metro areas, leading to a slower recovery from the COVID-19 recession. Studies, such as those conducted by the Manhattan Institute, highlight the presence of education and cultural centers, infrastructure, diverse services, transportation access, and healthcare availability as factors contributing to the concentration of population in urban areas.\n\nHowever, urban areas face their fair share of challenges that lead individuals to relocate to the suburbs. A major issue is the lack of affordable housing. High demand in dense areas can outstrip housing supply, pushing up rents and homeownership costs, potentially leading to gentrification and displacement of low-income residents. A report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a full-time minimum wage worker cannot afford a two-bedroom rental apartment in a major city, highlighting the affordability challenges in dense areas. 20 Least Densely Populated States in the US\n\nArthimedes/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe made a list of the 20 least densely populated states in the US, using average population per square mile data from the US Census Bureau.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program took a jab at the Department of Justice and Washington authorities in general, calling regulators “anti-innovation” who have “contempt” against those who became rich in the technology sector. Cramer was referring to the DoJ’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accused the iPhone maker of  throttling competitive alternatives from other companies and trying to maintain a monopoly in the smartphone market. Cramer said that the regulators hate and “abhor” big businesses because the bigger they are the more successful they become. Jim Cramer, who has been repeatedly recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) during his programs, uring investors to “hold it, not trade it,” said that Washington’s “anti-business bias” was evident when it brought the lawsuit against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on what Cramer called a “shameful day.”\n\nWhy Cramer Loves Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) So Much?\n\nCramer then highlighted the reasons why he’s been so bullish on Apple, and these thoughts provide an interesting sneak peek into what goes on in Cramer’s mind when he’s choosing stocks for the long-term. Cramer said he did not ask his viewers to hold Apple stock for the long term because it’s a stock with a relatively low P/E ratio or because it has “got the hottest technology out there?” These were not the reasons behind Cramer’s bullish outlook on Apple. Cramer said he recommended holding onto Apple shares because it’s the “most innovative consumer products technology company ever.”\n\nCramer Thinks DoJ Has a \"Loser Case\" Against Apple\n\nIn a blunt move, Cramer grabbed a copy of the DoJ’s case against Apple and threw it away, calling it a “loser” case which does not hold any merit. Cramer said that he isn’t worried at all about the DoJ’s case against Apple because he knows a “loser case” when he “sees it.” According to Cramer, Apple pays the “most taxes” and creates the “most jobs.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer said the pullback in Apple shares after the case was expected, but he sees it as a buying opportunity which long-term investors would look back to and thank the Department of Justice for.\n\nWhile Jim Cramer is recommending investors to pile into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in addition to other tech names like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), he is bearish on some stocks. In this article we will take a look at the stocks he's recommending investors to stay away from. Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\n11. Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 5\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about midstream energy infrastructure company Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA). Cramer said:\n\n“I see you, and I raise you with Enterprise Products Partners.”\n\nCramer also said that Enterprise Products Partners is a “better” company than Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA).\n\nLast month, during its earnings call, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NASDAQ:PAA) management talked about guidance and expectations:\n\n\"Looking at 2024 compared to 2023 and as illustrated by the EBITDA walk on Slide 9, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.625 billion to $2.725 billion with year-over-year growth in our Crude Oil segment, partially offsetting commodity price headwinds in our NGL segment. Growth in our Crude Oil segment is primarily driven by anticipated tariff volume increases, higher fees from tariff escalators and full year contributions from bolt-on acquisitions. This is partially offset by our assumption of fewer market-based opportunities. We expect lower year-over-year NGL segment adjusted EBITDA, driven by lower forecasted frac spreads, partially offset by higher C3 plus spec product sales in 2024. I would note that our C3 plus spec product sales volumes are approximately 90% hedged for the year in the mid $0.60 per gallon level.\n\nWe remain disciplined with our capital investments with approximately $375 million of growth capital and approximately $230 million of maintenance capital expected for the year, net to PAA. This includes capital for POP JV well connections and intra-basin improvement as well as an increase in our capital related to our previously announced Fort Sask debottleneck project. As illustrated on Slide 10 and in addition to a capital discipline, we remain committed to significant returns of capital and maintaining financial ability. For 2024, we expect to generate $1.65 billion of adjusted free cash flow excluding changes in assets and liabilities with approximately $1.15 billion to be allocated to common and preferred distributions inclusive of the respective increases resulting in $500 million of adjusted free cash flow after distributions available for value-creating opportunities, including potential bolt-on acquisitions or net debt reduction.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n10. Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nAI-based voice technology solutions company Soundhound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another stock Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from for now.

        "title": "Nvidia Has a Secret Weapon to Keep Growing Long Into the Future",
        "content": "High-end chip maker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has smashed expectations year over year, with annualized revenue growth of 60% since 2021. With yearly releases of improved graphics processing units (GPUs) for both gaming and cloud computing, the company has been able to continuously offer the best GPU hardware on the market. This strategy has led the company's stock on a meteoric rise. But what happens if the growth stops?\n\nAt Friday's prices, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is around 80, more than double the valuation of the tech sector overall. That means if growth slows or profitability wanes, its stock price could get slashed. In fact, competition in the high-end GPU market could end up challenging Nvidia's revenue growth.\n\nBut growth-minded investors hoping the upward trends that make Nvidia so valuable can take heart. The company's new focus on its data center product lines could be the answer.\n\nThe threat to Nvidia's GPU dominance\n\nWhile Nvidia is known for high-performance graphics processing units, GPUs come in many types. But in the case of data center GPUs, Nvidia controls an astounding 98% of the market, according to industry research by Wells Fargo. This immense advantage comes from the company's early leg up in the technology as its inventor and a current lack of serious competition. However, nothing lasts forever in the tech sector, as the constant GPU competition has bred innovation among Nvidia's competitors -- namely Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nSince announcing its new Instinct MI300 GPU line-up, AMD has been turning heads as a potential alternative to Nvidia's dominance. While it's impossible to predict how the AMD product line will perform in real-world data center applications, its release will ultimately put a dent in Nvidia's GPU revenue.\n\nDespite Nvidia's marginally better performance across GPU offerings, its current pricing puts it at risk of AMD undercutting it in the data center GPU realm as well. Furthermore, as other GPU suppliers catch up in the market, the demand that Nvidia currently takes advantage of to generously price its products will likely saturate.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe significance of the data center platform\n\nNvidia touts its data center platform as \"the world's most adopted accelerated computing solution, deployed by the largest supercomputing centers and enterprises,\" yet the real value of this platform cannot be overstated. With cloud computing services becoming relevant to nearly every existing business, demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs resulted in $18.4 billion in revenue for the product line in 2023. This represents a 409% increase from 2022, and that revenue stream will only continue to increase as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) data processing expands in 2024.\n\nYet one real future possibility for Nvidia may not be its hardware sales from data center GPUs, but rather its long-term service revenue. By switching to service-based business models, Nvidia could hedge against the eventual saturation or decrease in demand for the GPU hardware market.\n\nThe decision to shift from hardware to software is one we've seen other tech giants make, both in the past and present. One such example is Microsoft, which started its tech journey as a personal computer company but eventually focused on software and services like Windows and Azure. Even Apple's falling hardware sales are currently supplemented by its more profitable software services, like Apple Music and the App Store. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA glimpse into Nvidia's service-based future\n\nA current example of how Nvidia may shift to more service-based revenues is its DGX Cloud, which offers custom AI training solutions. The service essentially intends to surpass the limitations of traditional AI infrastructures. Nvidia aims to achieve this by doing away with the current enterprise trends of driving insights from endless sources of unstructured data.\n\nThough traditional cloud computing currently serves the purpose of supporting AI processing, Nvidia sees its limitations and markets DGX Cloud as a far more efficient and cost-effective solution. This mirrors how Nvidia released CUDA as a free-to-use software development tool, thus expanding applications of its general processing GPUs. As such, DGX Cloud extends the same expertise to AI training via cloud computing.\n\nDubbing it a \"serverless AI factory,\" Nvidia intends to onboard customer-side developers, giving them the capability to rapidly experiment with remote GPU resources instead of having to try to fit procured hardware to the current needs. In this model, Nvidia handles all of the hardware costs resembling a hardware-as-a-service business model and enables its customers to focus on software iteration.\n\nIs a service-based Nvidia a buy today?\n\nFor investors, the days of gargantuan portfolio growth on the back of Nvidia's stock are in the past. The 51,000% returns investors have seen over the past 20 years are mathematically unfeasible for a company with a $2.4 trillion market cap. But that doesn't mean Nvidia is no longer worth investing in. Should the company manage to keep growth rates high, it will only continue to increase in value. Whether or not it can successfully bolster its growth with hardware and software services remains to be seen, but the current market growth in cloud computing does signal increasing revenue opportunities for Nvidia in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, speculation around a potential stock split could make Nvidia more accessible to retail investors uncomfortable with a share price around $950. Thanks to tremendously innovative leadership and commitment to expanding news services and business models, Nvidia will likely remain a stable choice for investors looking to add it to a long-term growth portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Exclusive-Behind the plot to break Nvidia’s grip on AI by targeting software",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia earned its $2.2 trillion market cap by producing artificial-intelligence chips that have become the lifeblood powering the new era of generative AI developers from startups to Microsoft, OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet.\n\nAlmost as important to its hardware is the company’s nearly 20 years' worth of computer code, which helps make competition with the company nearly impossible. More than 4 million global developers rely on Nvidia's CUDA software platform to build AI and other apps.\n\nNow a coalition of tech companies that includes Qualcomm, Google and Intel plans to loosen Nvidia’s chokehold by going after the chip giant’s secret weapon: the software that keeps developers tied to Nvidia chips. They are part of an expanding group of financiers and companies hacking away at Nvidia's dominance in AI.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We're actually showing developers how you migrate out from an Nvidia platform,\" Vinesh Sukumar, Qualcomm's head of AI and machine learning, said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nStarting with a piece of technology developed by Intel called OneAPI, the UXL Foundation, a consortium of tech companies, plans to build a suite of software and tools that will be able to power multiple types of AI accelerator chips, executives involved with the group told Reuters. The open-source project aims to make computer code run on any machine, regardless of what chip and hardware powers it.\n\n\"It's about specifically - in the context of machine learning frameworks - how do we create an open ecosystem, and promote productivity and choice in hardware,\" Google's director and chief technologist of high-performance computing, Bill Hugo, told Reuters in an interview. Google is one of the founding members of UXL and helps determine the technical direction of the project, Hugo said.\n\nUXL's technical steering committee is preparing to nail down technical specifications in the first half of this year. Engineers plan to refine the technical details to a \"mature\" state by the end of the year, executives said. These executives stressed the need to build a solid foundation to include contributions from multiple companies that can also be deployed on any chip or hardware.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond the initial companies involved, UXL will court cloud-computing companies such as Amazon.com and Microsoft's Azure, as well as additional chipmakers.\n\nSince its launch in September, UXL has already begun to receive technical contributions from third parties that include foundation members and outsiders keen on using the open-source technology, the executives involved said. Intel's OneAPI is already useable, and the second step is to create a standard programming model of computing designed for AI.\n\nUXL plans to put its resources toward addressing the most pressing computing problems dominated by a few chipmakers, such as the latest AI apps and high-performance computing applications. Those early plans feed in to the organization's longer-term goal of winning over a critical mass of developers to its platform.\n\nUXL eventually aims to support Nvidia hardware and code, in the long run.\n\nWhen asked about the open source and venture-funded software efforts to break Nvidia’s AI dominance, Nvidia executive Ian Buck said in a statement: \"The world is getting accelerated. New ideas in accelerated computing are coming from all across the ecosystem, and that will help advance AI and the scope of what accelerated computing can achieve.\"\n\nNEARLY 100 STARTUPS\n\nThe UXL Foundation's plans are one of many efforts to chip away at Nvidia's hold on the software that powers AI. Venture financiers and corporate dollars have poured more than $4 billion into 93 separate efforts, according to custom data compiled by PitchBook at Reuters’ request.\n\nThe interest in unseating Nvidia through a potential weakness in software has ramped up in the last year, and startups aiming to poke holes in the company's leadership gobbled up just over $2 billion in 2023 compared with $580 million from a year ago, according to the data from PitchBook.\n\nSuccess in the shadow of Nvidia's group on AI data crunching is an achievement that few of the startups will be able to achieve. Nvidia's CUDA is a compelling piece of software on paper, as it is full-featured and is consistently growing both from Nvidia's contributions and the developer community.\n\n\"But that's not what really matters,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm. \"What matters is the fact that people have been using CUDA for 15 years, they built code around it.\"\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "Stan Druckenmiller ran a very successful hedge fund between 1981 and 2010. He never had a single losing year, and he returned an average of 30% annually to clients. Very few Wall Street money managers have a track record half that good, and that makes Druckenmiller an excellent case study for investors.\n\nToday, he manages his multibillion-dollar fortune through the Duquesne Family Office. As of the quarter ended in December, Druckenmiller had 21.1% of his portfolio invested in two \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) accounted for 9.1% and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) accounted for 12% of his invested assets. The size of those positions is a clear sign of high conviction.\n\nAre Nvidia and Microsoft still worthwhile investments?\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia reported phenomenal financial results for the fourth quarter, crushing estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue soared 265% to $22.1 billion on triple-digit sales growth in the data center and professional visualization segments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income skyrocketed 486% to $5.16 per diluted share as gross margin expanded more than 10 percentage points due to pricing power and a scaling software business, which comes with even higher margins than Nvidia hardware.\n\nThe company is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the gold standard in handling computer graphics and complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, Nvidia holds a more-than-95% market share in workstation graphics, and an 80%-plus share in AI chips.\n\nBut the company is truly formidable because it has expanded into the adjacent data center markets of high-performance networking equipment, central processing units (CPUs), subscription software, and cloud services -- all purpose-built for AI.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang highlighted that strategy at the annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) the company hosted recently. \"Nvidia doesn't build chips. Nvidia builds data centers,\" Huang said. He continued: \"Nvidia's opportunity is not the GPU opportunity. A lot of people make GPUs. We're pursuing the data center market.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThat strategy not only creates monetization possibilities beyond GPUs, but also reduces friction for customers. As Huang explained, Nvidia essentially sells ready-made data centers purpose-built for powering AI workloads.\n\nWith that in mind, Nvidia values its addressable market at $1 trillion, and Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share by 35% annually over the next five years. While impressive, that consensus estimate still makes its current valuation of 77 times earnings look quite expensive.\n\nPersonally, I would wait for a much cheaper entry point before purchasing Nvidia stock, and I say that as a current shareholder.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nThis tech giant posted strong financial results for the second quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 18% to $62 billion on solid sales growth in commercial software and cloud computing services. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jumped 26% to $2.93 per diluted share due to disciplined expense management. Management guided for 14% to 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, and investors can expect similar results in the future as the company leans into AI.\n\nMicrosoft dominates the software-as-a-service market due in large part to success with its office productivity (Microsoft 365), enterprise resource management (Dynamics 365), and cybersecurity products. The company has introduced generative AI copilots that automate tasks across those software categories. For instance, Microsoft 365 Copilot can draft text in Word, create presentations in PowerPoint, and analyze data in Excel. Management expects those generative AI copilots to contribute more significantly to revenue in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is also gaining market share in cloud computing. Its Azure unit accounted for 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the fourth quarter, up nearly 2 percentage points from the prior year. CEO Satya Nadella attributes those share gains to investments in AI, most notably its partnership with OpenAI. Specifically, Microsoft is the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI, and Azure customers can build custom generative AI applications using OpenAI large language models like GPT-4, the cognitive engine behind ChatGPT Plus.\n\nGoing forward, the software-as-a-service market is forecast to grow by 13.7% annually, and the cloud computing market is projected to expand at a 14.1% annualized rate during the same period. That gives Microsoft a good shot at generating annual revenue growth in the low teens through the end of the decade. Investors can expect slightly faster growth on the bottom line due share buybacks and continued focus on cost control.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects Microsoft to boost its earnings per share by 16% annually over the next five years. But that consensus forecast makes the current valuation of nearly 39 times earnings look quite expensive. Microsoft is an excellent company with strong growth prospects, but I would be surprised to see this Magnificent Seven stock beat the market over the next five years from its current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Another Super Semiconductor Stock Just Hit a New Record High, and It's Not Too Late to Buy",
        "content": "The semiconductor industry is the beating heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It produces the advanced chips for data centers where developers build, train, and deploy their AI models. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) are best-in-class for those applications.\n\nNvidia stock has more than tripled over the last 12 months, carrying the company to a $2.2 trillion valuation. Only Apple and Microsoft are worth more.\n\nNvidia will likely continue to create value for investors, so I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget about the company. But the AI industry is evolving quickly and a number of other stocks in the chip space are also surging. Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) stock just hit a record high of $113.50, surpassing its previous best-ever level from two years ago. Here's why it's not too late to buy.\n\nThe data center isn't the only game in town when it comes to AI\n\nMicron is one of the world's leading producers of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, both of which are increasingly important to extracting maximum performance from Nvidia's data center GPUs. In fact, Nvidia chose Micron's HBM3E memory solution to power its latest H200 chip, which is the successor to its industry-leading H100.\n\nMicron's HBM3E memory consumes an estimated 30% less energy than competing hardware, and reducing electricity usage is a growing focus for data center operators due to the sheer amount of computing power commanded by AI workloads. Therefore, it's no surprise that Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is completely sold out for calendar 2024, and most of its calendar 2025 supply has also been allocated already.\n\nBut Micron's AI opportunity is now expanding beyond the data center. Every new computer and mobile device will soon be fitted with AI processors, which will speed up response times and improve the user experience. The chipsets inside next-generation computers are called neural processing units (NPUs) and are specifically designed to handle AI workloads. They require up to 80% more DRAM content than today's average PC chips, and that translates to more revenue for Micron.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the mobile space, Micron expects AI-enabled smartphones to carry up to double the DRAM content compared to traditional models. Micron's AI chips can be found in Samsung's new Galaxy S24 device, which comes with a host of AI features. One of them is Live Translate, which allows two people to speak over the phone in different languages, and another is Circle to Search, which recognizes objects in photos and allows the user to instantly run an online search.\n\nOn-device processing is the industry's next frontier, because it will take AI out of the data center and insert it into everyday life. Demand is already soaring; Advanced Micro Devices is a leader in AI CPU and NPU technologies, and it has shipped millions of AI-enabled computers to date.\n\nMicron has returned to profitability\n\nMicron's revenue plunged by 50% during fiscal 2023 (ended Aug. 31, 2023), dragging the company's bottom line to a net loss of $5.8 billion for the year. Pandemic-related supply shortages caused the chip industry to overproduce, leading to an inventory glut and plummeting prices.\n\nMicron has now emerged from that period. The company's revenue returned to growth in the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), although it still lost more than $1.2 billion at the bottom line. But the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) was a true breakout period for the company.\n\nMicron delivered $5.8 billion in revenue, which was a whopping 57% year-over-year increase, and it also crushed the company's forecast of $5.3 billion. Plus, it generated a net income of $793 million, which marked a welcome return to profitability.\n\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra attributed the strong quarter to a tightening supply demand balance, which had a positive impact on prices across all end markets. However, he also gave a nod to the strength in AI server (data center) demand.\n\nMicron is forecasting $6.6 billion in revenue for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1), which would represent an increase of 76% compared to the year-ago period. That would be a powerful growth acceleration from the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Micron stock is a buy despite trading at an all-time high\n\nSince Micron was losing money up until Q2, investors can't use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value its stock. However, based on the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $18.3 billion and its current market capitalization of $122 billion, Micron stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7.\n\nThat's extremely cheap compared to Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 37, and even Advanced Micro Devices stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 12.9. Those names deserve a premium because their work in the GPU, CPU, and NPU spaces is unprecedented, and they effectively create demand for Micron's products.\n\nHowever, AI is expected to add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy over the next 10 years, and Micron's hardware is a key component to unlocking that value creation. The company is ramping up the pace of innovation; it's now sampling its 12-high HBM3E data center product, which increases DRAM capacity by 50%. That means companies like Nvidia can pack more memory into each GPU, which leads to faster training and inferencing, paving the way for more advanced AI models.\n\nWith Micron's revenue growth clearly accelerating, the all-time high in its stock shouldn't deter investors from buying it -- especially considering its valuation and the substantial opportunity that lies ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Super Micro Computer: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "It's been three decades since there's been a next-big-thing investment trend that's captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Just as the advent of the internet changed the course of corporate America 30 years ago, there's a growing belief that AI can lead to that next leap in economic growth and innovation.\n\nThe wide-ranging potential for AI to transform virtually every sector and industry isn't lost on Wall Street or its top-tier investors. When examined as a whole, billionaire investors have piled into AI stocks, with many of Wall Street's most-successful billionaire money managers not wanting to miss the boat. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFollowing monumental gains, Super Micro Computer has found itself on the chopping block\n\nOne company that's undeniably benefited from the sky-high expectations Wall Street has set for the AI revolution is server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Shares of Super Micro ended March 19 higher by 220% on a year-to-date basis, and 853% on a trailing-12-month basis, all thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nWhereas a lot of investors are focused on the gamut of generative AI solutions being offered by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" it's the AI infrastructure companies -- those providing the physical backbone that allow AI-accelerated data centers to do their thing -- which have really thrived. Super Micro Computer provides the customizable rack servers businesses are using in their high-compute data centers.\n\nSuper Micro also has intricate ties to AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's high-end servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become nothing short of the standard in data centers geared at generative AI solutions.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the idea that Super Micro Computer is going to be an outperformer. Based on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the December-ended quarter, three billionaire investors were active sellers of Super Micro stock, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 255,383 shares sold Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors: 144,833 shares sold Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 93,827 shares sold\n\nWhile relying on Nvidia's high-powered GPUs has given Super Micro Computer stock an undeniable associated boost, it also means the company is constrained by Nvidia's supply shortage of its top chips.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro has a history of failing to meet lofty expectations. The company's customizable servers were expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread during the initial cloud boom. Unfortunately, demand failed to meet the lofty expectations set by Wall Street and investors. AI may represent another instance of a next-big-thing trend enduring a bubble prior to its maturation.\n\nBut while these three billionaires were dumping shares of Super Micro Computer, they were collectively piling into shares of six other AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSteven Cohen adds time-tested, bubble-resistant AI stocks\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen and his investment team haven't been shy about paring down their stakes in outperforming AI stocks. While positions in Nvidia and Super Micro were significantly reduced during the fourth quarter, Cohen and his aides added to two time-tested AI stocks:\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 462,179 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL): 670,677 shares purchased\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because it operates the world's most-dominant e-commerce marketplace. But the bread-and-butter operating segment that generates the lion's share of Amazon's cash flow and operating income is cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon is giving AWS customers access to a variety of generative AI solutions that can help them tailor their message to customers, as well as improve customer interactions. Given that enterprise cloud spending is still in its somewhat early stages, AWS has the potential to deliver sustained double-digit sales growth throughout the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nSelling Super Micro Computer and purchasing shares of rival Dell Technologies is another interesting move. Dell has a highly profitable personal-computing segment to fall back on if AI-server demand were to taper. Though Super Micro offers the superior short-term growth rate, Dell appears to be a smarter investment for those who want AI server exposure without stomach-churning share price volatility.\n\nKen Griffin piles into the infrastructure backbones of the AI movement\n\nA second billionaire money manager that wasn't shy about kicking Super Micro Computer to curb during the December-ended quarter is Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors. Despite dumping 56% of its stake in Super Micro, Citadel absolutely piled into the infrastructure backbones of the AI revolution:\n\nNvidia: 1,579,153 shares purchased Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD): 3,506,881 shares purchased\n\nNo company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia. According to analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia might account for 90% (or more) of the GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. As long as demand continues to outpace the supply of its high-powered chips, Nvidia should have no trouble commanding a high price for its superior product.\n\nAt the same time, I've pointed out no shortage of reasons Nvidia could be the bubble of the century. Aside from history not being in its favor, the biggest concern for Nvidia might be that its top four customers, which account for 40% of its total sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. It's pretty clear that these businesses want to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace this AI titan in their data centers altogether.\n\nGriffin's fund also gobbled up shares of Nvidia rival AMD. Last June, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100. Though AMD began the rollout of this core AI product to a small group of customers last year, a sizable ramp in production and deliveries is expected this year.\n\nDon't forget that AMD has also been chiseling away central processing unit (CPU) market share from Intel. Though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same rate as GPUs, AMD's foundational CPU business could help insulate the company far more than Nvidia if the AI bubble were to pop.\n\nIsrael Englander opts for a couple Magnificent Seven components\n\nThe final big seller of Super Micro Computer stock during the fourth quarter was billionaire Israel Englander at Millennium Management. Englander and his team jettisoned 82% of their previous stake in Super Micro in favor of two Magnificent Seven constituents:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased\n\nBuying big into Wall Street's most influential stocks represents a relatively safe way to take advantage of AI growth while protect yourself in the event that AI uptake fails to meet sky-high expectations.\n\nAlphabet's foundation continues to be its internet search engine Google. In February, Google was responsible for nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share. It's practically a monopoly that isn't going to be unseated anytime soon. This gives the company incredible ad-pricing power and generates abundant operating cash flow in most economic climates.\n\nBut Google Cloud might be Alphabet's most-promising growth segment. This now-profitable platform has earned a 10% global share of cloud infrastructure spend. Allowing its customers access to generative AI within Google Cloud can open new revenue streams for Alphabet.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has been actively incorporating AI solutions in its physical products for years. A perfect example being the fine-tuning associated with autocorrect and predictive text for iPhones. Apple is very much reliant on AI advancement to fuel sales of its beloved physical products.\n\nHowever, Apple's biggest long-term growth driver is likely its shift to subscription services. Although it's not abandoning the physical products that endeared users to its brand, Apple is complementing its revenue stream by becoming a platforms company. This move should be positive for its operating margin, as well as encourage users to stay within the umbrella of Apple's product and service ecosystem.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Investing in stocks can be tricky, as the market's past performance doesn't always indicate what's to come. However, knowledge is power, and noticing past patterns can help ensure you're ready to strike if history decides to repeat itself. As a result, it can only help investors to know that history suggests the Nasdaq Composite could surge in 2024.\n\nSince the index launched in 1971, it has risen by an average of 19% in each year that followed a market recovery of the magnitude seen in 2023. Consequently, it's not a bad idea to consider investing in the companies fueling the bulk of the Nasdaq Composite's growth.\n\nThe phrase \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined last year to describe the seven most prominent tech companies, which include Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. These companies rule tech, and many were key players in the market's stellar recovery last year.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven could be an excellent place to invest and profit from a potential surge in the Nasdaq composite in 2024. So, here are two Magnificent Seven stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of Nvidia's meteoric rise last year. Its stock soared by 239% in 2023 as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for artificial intelligence (AI) developers everywhere. These high-powered parallel-processing chips are crucial for training and powering AI models, with increased demand causing Nvidia's earnings to skyrocket.\n\nThe company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips while rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up on the technology front.\n\nIn Nvidia's most recent quarter (the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition in the AI chip space is expected to heat up this year, with AMD and Intel bringing powerful new hardware to market. However, in addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion.\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain market supremacy. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nThe table above shows Nvidia's earnings could hit close to $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 yields a stock price of about $1,300.\n\nConsidering the company's current position, that projection would see Nvidia's stock rise 44% over the next two fiscal years. Given its prominent position in AI, Nvidia is a Magnificent Seven stock that's too good to pass up.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer out in Seattle almost 30 years ago. The tech giant has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nBut all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\n\nIn 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site. It announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion. A solid recovery in its e-commerce earnings over the last year has seen Amazon's free cash flow soar 904% to over $32 billion, indicating the company has the funds to continue investing in its business and overcome possible headwinds.  Data by YCharts\n\nThe chart above indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by its forward P/E of 43, you get a stock price of $300.\n\nThis projection would see Amazon's stock rise 68% from its current value over the next two fiscal years. As a result, the company is worth considering before its share price surges.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Micron Is Sold Out of High-Bandwidth Memory Chips -- What Does That Mean for Nvidia's AI Dominance?",
        "content": "The most recent semiconductor industry downturn, led by the steep falloff in consumer electronics (PCs and smartphones) spending after the pandemic, has been absolutely brutal on U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). However, Micron is back in all-out growth mode, and it just turned a GAAP profit again in its last reported quarter (Q2 fiscal 2024, the three months ended in February 2024). Credit goes to a return of normal PC and smartphone purchasing, but another key factor is Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) generative artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nMicron's return to profitability has big implications for its stock (as well as for memory chip manufacturing equipment and service providers like Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX)). But it also has potentially monumental implications for Nvidia and the already white-hot generative AI infrastructure boom. Here's what investors need to know.\n\nMicron is fully booked and fresh out of leading-edge memory\n\nAs for high-level stuff, Micron reported a 58% year-over-year increase in sales last quarter to $5.82 billion. Its rapid return back to its last peak sales cycle, which occurred in 2022 at the end of the pandemic-induced chip shortage, will continue in fiscal Q3 2024 (which ends in May). Management is predicting revenue of $6.6 billion at the midpoint of guidance, which would equal a 76% year-over-year jump.\n\nThat growth is impressive, but note that Micron is still lapping its horribly depressed financial results from the depths of the bear market a year ago. MU Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis is all nevertheless fantastic news for Micron, which finally reported a GAAP net profit again of $793 million (or $476 million on an adjusted basis). The company has a lot to gain as it keeps ramping up manufacturing of HBM3e, the latest iteration of third-generation high-bandwidth memory. HBM3e is used in accelerated computing and AI -- like Nvidia's new systems just announced at its annual GTC event last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market has been going wild over a business that up until just this quarter has been operating deep in the red. But investors were vindicated by this quote from Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra: \"We are on track to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024 and expect HBM revenues to be accretive to our DRAM and overall gross margins starting in the fiscal third quarter. Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024, and the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.\"\n\nIn other words, it looks like the good times will keep rolling for at least another year, if not longer.\n\nDoes Nvidia's stock run have legs?\n\nAll eyes have been on Nvidia's historic run, with its shares up well over 500% since the start of 2023. Even after this melt-up, though, the stock trades for 37 times Wall Street analysts' current-year expectations for earnings per share.\n\nUnderpinning this expectation is that Nvidia earnings will double from last year. Just as Micron expects AI computing growth to continue almost unabated through 2025, so do Nvidia investors. The fact that Micron's HBM manufacturing capacity is almost completely booked out through 2025 is a solid indication of Nvidia's demand for more high-end memory chips.\n\nHowever, and this is the $2.3 trillion question (really, that's Nvidia's approximate market cap as of this writing), Nvidia's demand for these HBM chips will depend on its customers continuing to gobble up as many accelerated compute systems it can crank out with partners like Micron.\n\nBut the semiconductor manufacturing space is highly collaborative. It costs a great deal of money to design, build, and sell these systems. Nvidia isn't likely to be booking big orders from Micron if it wasn't getting advance orders from its big tech data center customers.\n\nTo be sure, this party will come to an end someday. But as of right now, it appears Nvidia has plenty of runway ahead of it. Micron as much as said so in its latest earnings update.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the oldest stock market index, and one in which the highest quality companies invest.\n\nAlthough investors sometimes regard the Dow as a boring index, plenty of stocks brim with excitement. Remember, the boring trait is valuable during corrections due to the defensive qualities of its blue-chip stocks. Also, some of these defensive companies can be the best innovators.\n\nToday, several companies on the Dow offer a combination of defense and growth. First, they are defensive due to their stable earnings and robust balance sheets. Second, they offer growth from participating in secular tailwinds like artificial intelligence and digital payments.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese strengths land these favorite Dow stocks among Wall Street analysts’ top picks. Analysts rate these three stocks buy or better and expect further upside. They are solid additions to any portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a bellwether that dominates several industries. First, it’s an e-commerce leader and the top cloud service provider by market share through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Its dominance extends beyond these two areas to freight and logistics, advertising and entertainment.\n\nSeveral secular tailwinds explain the reason it’s one of the favorite Dow stocks among analysts. First, the shift in shopping has moved from physical retail stores to online commerce. According to Boston Consulting Group, global online retail will grow 9% annually through 2027. As a result, e-commerce will account for 41% of global retail sales by 2027 from 18% in 2017.\n\nAnother major growth driver for Amazon is artificial intelligence (AI). First, AWS offers the most expansive compute instances for training and inference. Second, it provides Bedrock, a managed service with several high-performing foundation models that enable companies to build and scale AI applications. Third, the company is building generative AI applications for customer subscriptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nInevitably, e-commerce growth and artificial intelligence will power AMZN stock higher. Wall Street optimistically agrees, as reflected by 51 buy and 7 overweight ratings. Analysts expect a substantial upside with an average price target of $207.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The logo for Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is shown on a phone screen in front of the Microsoft logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBesides Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), no other company has capitalized more on the AI trend than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In February 2023, CEO Satya Nadella stirred excitement when he stated that they would make Google dance. It was a warning shot that Bing, powered by AI, would attempt to challenge Google Search.\n\nAlthough the search threat hasn’t panned out, the tech giant is leading AI innovation. First, Azure AI has become the preferred cloud infrastructure provider for building, training and deploying AI models and applications. Notably, Microsoft Azure grew 30% year over year (YOY) last quarter compared to AWS’s 13% growth, highlighting its AI services advantage.\n\nSince Microsoft is also a productivity company, it has developed Copilot for most of its productivity applications. In September 2023, it launched Copilot powered by AI. Copilot simplifies tasks across Microsoft 365 applications like Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook and Teams. Notably, the company is already monetizing these services, charging $30 per user monthly.\n\nWith Microsoft positioned to benefit from AI, it has become one of the favorite Dow stocks to buy. The tech giant is already showing tangible AI benefits in its earnings. Unsurprisingly, the stock is near all-time highs and analysts expect an 11% upside.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAside from the AI trade, investors can consider other favorite Dow stocks. A great option is Visa (NYSE:V), which will continue to benefit from the shift from cash to digital payments. The company provides payment rails that facilitate most credit card and mobile wallet payments.\n\nAs the largest open credit card network, Visa competes against peers Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and China-based Union Pay. It’s worth noting that Visa doesn’t extend credit. Instead, it acts as a middleman between credit card issuers (financial institutions) and merchants, earning fees on each transaction.\n\nOver the years, doubters have forecasted Visa’s decline due to the emergence of fintech companies. Instead, the card network has only strengthened its stronghold in the payments ecosystem. Today, Visa has partnered with a majority of fintechs, such as Block (NYSE:SQ), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Remitly (NASDAQ:RELY).\n\nNotably, Visa’s greatest competition is cash. According to McKinsey, cash usage has declined rapidly, losing 20 percentage points of total global payments in the last five years. As payments shift to card and digital payments, room for growth enlarges.\n\nFinally, Visa is a payment tollbooth that benefits from network effects. Hence, it’s one of my favorite Dow stocks. The more users on its network, the more valuable it is to its merchants, which in turn enhances convenience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution.\n\nArtificial intelligence products like automated assistants, chatbots, robotics, and even self-driving vehicles have become all the rage in the media over the past few years, propelling the cutting edge tech industry to the forefront of global growth. According to a report by professional services firm PwC, the global AI market will contribute more than $15.7 trillion to the world economy by the end of this decade. This number is more than the economic output of powerhouses like China and India combined.\n\nIn the next few years, per an analysis by research firm Grand View Research, the AI market is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate of a scary 37%. China and the United States are expected to lead this boom in the AI world. AI will contribute to a nearly 30% increase in total GDP output from China by 2030, with North America following behind at around 15%. AI growth trends can be seen in context of the ChatGPT craze. The application became the fastest-growing in history by hitting 100 million active users within a month of launch.\n\nSome of the most promising applications for AI include uses in wearable technology, chip market solutions, self-driving cars, and automated medical procedures, among a host of other applications in the business world. Global Market Insights estimates that the wearable AI market will reach close to $200 billion in value by the end of next year. Similarly, more than 8 billion digital voice assistants could be in use worldwide by the end of this year. The global AI chip market will reach close to $100 billion in value within the next three years.\n\nBig companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investing heavily in AI products to take advantage of this AI evolution. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), recently highlighted some of the efforts his company was making in this regard during the first quarter earnings call at the beginning of February.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe companies that stand to benefit from the increased adoption of AI products and related services were selected and ranked according to hedge fund sentiment. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution\n\nA portfolio manager studying various stocks and other securities on a tablet.\n\nStocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution\n\n11.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best small cap AI stocks to buy now. To skip our detailed analysis of the AI sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Small Cap AI Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAI: A Consequential Technology\n\nArtificial intelligence has taken the world by storm. AI has become one of the most exciting things to come out of the technology sector. As a result, some of the best AI stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, are working the hardest to contribute to the AI race and maybe even lead it, have been attracting even larger amounts of investor attention. This is unsurprising, considering the immense growth AI has been undergoing. On February 14, George Lee, the co-head of the Goldman Sachs Office of Applied Innovation, discussed the growth potential of artificial intelligence, particularly with regard to geopolitics, and how geopolitics, in turn, may shape an AI-enabled future, on CNBC's \"Capital Connection.\" Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"For me, where I specialize is really this intersection of generative AI and geopolitics. The rise of this new capability in the world is super consequential for countries and for regions, matters of economics, defense, and even culture itself, as Jensen Huang talked about the other day.\"\n\nOn being asked how he expects machine intelligence to impact global growth, productivity, and the US-China conflict, Lee made the following comments:\n\n\"Well, our economists have called for a very significant impact, over a 10-year period, some 1.5% increase in global GDP as a result of this [AI]. Now, I think the important thing to reflect on that is that it's a 10 year interval. While this has arrived abruptly, it's hugely consequential and fascinating, it will take time for this to deepen its impact across economies around the world. And so, we're very focused on trying to monitor that, and I think, my personal view is that there is going to be remarkable productivity and economic gains emerging from this. There's also going to be an incredible leap in human creativity and productivity as we partner with machines just to address and solve challenges that have been prohibitively difficult in the past.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Lee, humanity will likely evolve with machines and artificial intelligence, resulting in exceptional growth moving forward. He noted the following:\n\n\"In a sense, I think we will co-evolve with these machines, and look, we are very early days in this new generative AI revolution, but the pace of improvement, the trajectory of improvement, is so remarkable, that I think we do have to think pretty broadly about how we're going to co-exist with machines, how we're going to cooperate, and how, together, we can elevate humanity.\"\n\nGlobal Leaders in the AI Space\n\nWith the discussion on AI rapidly gaining speed and importance across the globe, many are beginning to wonder which global players will lead the way in this new global world order that is so heavily impacted by technology and artificial intelligence in particular. Lee gave his opinion on the matter of global leaders in the AI race as well. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"The US and China have an early lead in this. Like other technology revolutions, such as the internet, a lot of this sprang from the US, both academic and commercial roots. China is somewhat challenged in this area, both because they're export-controlled away from some of the key technologies they need, and there's also this issue of the emergent quality of chatbots being somewhat threatening to regimes that are sensitive to social harmony and stability. But make no mistake, they are a formidable adversary and will be leaders in this space. You then have a series of countries, the EU, England, France, etc., who are going to be very consequential here, particularly in terms of regulation. Then you have countries that have a particular technology edge in this domain, those are places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands. And then, most interestingly, you have countries like the UAE... who have done extraordinary work in building their Falcon open source model, the work they've done around Arabic language foundation models, and just the general infrastructure investing they're doing.\"\n\nConsidering the above highlights, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy, particularly the best small-cap AI stocks to buy now.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market expanded rapidly over the past few years as more companies recognized the value of crunching large amounts of data to make smarter decisions. Advertisers tapped AI algorithms to craft better targeted ads, autonomous vehicles used AI to spot and avoid obstacles, and large organizations used AI tools to automate tasks and streamline their operations.\n\nThe growing popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E, which allow users to create new content instead of just analyzing existing data, further reinforced the notion that the AI market had plenty of room to expand.

Its high-end data center graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to process complex AI tasks for most of the world's leading AI companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon, and Alphabet's Google.\n\nNvidia's GPUs process a large range of numbers simultaneously. That makes them better suited for handling AI tasks than traditional CPUs, which still process a single piece of data at a time. The rapid growth of the AI market sparked a buying frenzy in Nvidia's top-tier data center GPUs, and its revenue surged 126% in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January) as its adjusted EPS soared 288%. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to jump another 81% and 90%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 -- but its stock still looks reasonably valued at 38 times forward earnings in the context of soaring business growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron(NASDAQ: MU) is one of the world's largest producers of memory chips. It manufactures denser and more power-efficient chips than its larger rivals, and that technological edge makes it a great fit for data centers that want to process AI tasks more efficiently. But in fiscal 2023 (which ended last August), Micron's revenue tumbled 49% and it posted a net loss for the full year as it grappled with a tough cyclical slowdown.\n\nThose declines were caused by the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown, the end of the 5G upgrade cycle, macro headwinds for the industrial market, and regulatory challenges in China. But for fiscal 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise 35% with a narrower loss as its core markets stabilize and more data centers upgrade their AI capabilities. Therefore, it might be a great time to buy Micron -- which looks quite affordable at six times this year's sales -- as its cyclical downturn ends.\n\nThe top two software makers: Microsoft and Snowflake\n\nMicrosoft is the top AI software maker for two simple reasons. First, it's a major investor in OpenAI, the world's hottest AI start-up. Second, it's integrating OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into its search engine, productivity software, and cloud-based services. Those moves enabled Microsoft to grow its cloud infrastructure platform Azure at a faster pace than its two largest competitors, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It also gave it a shot at cracking Google's search engine dominance while widening its moat against other enterprise software makers.\n\nAnalysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 14% and 15%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which starts this July). It certainly isn't cheap at 32 times forward earnings, but its myriad strengths could justify that premium valuation.\n\nLastly, if we look behind the scenes, we'll see that Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) is helping many large companies organize their data. Snowflake's cloud-based data warehouses are used to aggregate data from a wide range of computing platforms, then clean it all up so third-party data visualization and analytics applications can easily read it.\n\nSnowflake's silo-busting approach made it a popular pick for large and fragmented organizations, and its recent integration of generative AI tools should make it even easier to process all that data. It aims to generate $10 billion in product revenue by fiscal 2029 (which ends in Jan. 2029), which implies it could grow at a CAGR of 30% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2029.\n\nSnowflake isn't profitable yet and its stock looks a bit pricey at 15 times this year's sales, but its market could continue to expand as organizations gobble up more data for their AI applications.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "12 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best data center stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the data center industry, which is one of the hottest in the world right now, then you can skip ahead to take a look at the 5 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were expecting at the start of the fourth quarter of 2021. Back then, the Federal Reserve had yet to start to raise interest rates, even though some voices on Wall Street were raising alarm bells about the effects of the monetary policy and stimulus packages in the era of COVID-19 lock downs. High rates naturally do not bode well for high growth sectors, and technology stocks big and small had a rough time on the market the next year particularly as the Russian invasion of Ukraine upended global food and energy markets and spurred multi year high inflation levels which made some question whether consecutive 75 basis point hikes by the Federal Reserve were still a bit low.\n\nNow, with the first quarter of 2024 coming to an end, the stock market is a fundamentally changed environment due to the rise of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA has shown to be the hottest artificial intelligence stock on Wall Street, and at its heart is the multi-billion global data center industry. While most people experience the user side of AI, at its heart, the technology is part of a broader set of data analysis techniques such as machine learning.\n\nWhether it's AI or ML, both require copious amounts of data to spearhead leading edge applications in high technology industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Processing and storing this data requires considerable data center facilities, which are large scale computing houses that 'host' equipment such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and storage modules.\n\nA variety of firms cater to the needs of the global data center industry. Some of the best known in this area are data center hardware manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). On the software side, firms such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) provide businesses with software environments to generate meaningful insights from their data.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, to analyze the performance of data center stocks, one can either see how individual firms such as the equities listed above are performing or track a collection of stocks called an exchange traded fund (ETF). Most popular data center ETFs also include real estate investment trusts (ETFs) due to the sizeable real estate requirements of operating and owning data centers. One such ETF is the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF. Its six month, 12 month, and 36 month year returns sit at 14.5%, 22.27%, and 2.10%, respectively. As expected, the ETF's annual returns in 2022 were negative, as the broader technology sector took a beating.\n\nFinally, one stock that helps keep track of the broader data center industry might be faring is Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:DLR). Here's what Baron Funds had to say about this particular stock in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\nFollowing strong share performance, we trimmed our large investment in data center REIT Digital Realty Trust, Inc. We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for the company.\n\nData center landlords such as Digital Realty (and Equinix, Inc.) are benefiting from record low vacancy, demand outpacing supply, more constrained power availability, and rising rental rates. Several secular demand vectors, which are currently broadening, are contributing to robust fundamentals for data center space globally. They include the outsourcing of information technology infrastructure, increased cloud computing adoption, the ongoing growth in mobile data and internet traffic, and artificial intelligence as a new wave of data center demand.\n\nIn the last few months, we have also spent time with CEO Andy Power of Digital Realty. Over the last few years, Andy and Digital Realty’s management team have been undergoing a business transformation, which accelerated after its acquisition of Interxion in March 2020, a pure-play European network-dense data center operator. The company has been shedding non-core slower-growth assets, investing and expanding in Europe, growing its retail colocation business, improving its balance sheet, and adding operational expertise by supplementing new management leadership. We have spent a significant amount of time with Andy over the years and believe the investments the company has made are on the cusp of bearing fruit and will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, we believe the fundamentals in its core business are at an inflection point with robust demand/bookings, pricing power, hyperscale cloud players outsourcing a higher percentage of their digital infrastructure needs and limited competitive capacity. We believe these factors will lead to growth in the core business in the next few years and are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the company.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some undervalued and best data center stocks according to analysts. A couple that top the list are VNET Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET), IHS Holding Limited (NYSE:IHS), and Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD). 12 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nThe silhouette of a data center facility in the sunset, illustrating the companies focus on data center solutions.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best data center stocks according to analysts, we ranked the data center related constituents of the Global X Data Center REITs & Digital Infrastructure ETF by the average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked those with the highest upside.\n\nFor these undervalued data center stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Data Center Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\n12. Micron Technology, Inc.

        "title": "Here's My Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock for Long-Term Investors to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have dominated investing headlines recently, as this exclusive group of megacap companies are in a league of their own and have mostly delivered strong performance recently.\n\nWhile Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has certainly been the most exciting Magnificent Seven stock to watch so far in 2024, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been in a two-way race for the title of the largest market cap in the U.S. stock market, I wouldn't be surprised if the best performer in the Magnificent Seven over the next five to 10 years was Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nThe two sides of Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is best known for its Google subsidiary, and for good reason. In addition to the Google Search business, which is dominant in its industry, Google also has Gmail, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and the Android mobile operating system, just to name a few. These collectively are known as the Google Services business. In fact, I've used four different Google products in the process of writing this article. This is a massive business that generates a ton of reliable, high-margin income.\n\nThe other main part of the business is Google Cloud, which is a cloud infrastructure provider that competes with Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. It has the number three market share right now but is growing fast.\n\nAlphabet could be a big long-term winner\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money from ad sales, especially on the Google Services side of the business, and there could be more potential for growth here than it seems. Thanks to evolving AI technology, Alphabet is continually getting better at targeting ads more effectively, which inherently makes them more valuable. Plus, while there is certainly limited growth potential in its search business, that's not the case for some of Alphabet's other ad-driven platforms, such as YouTube.\n\nGoogle Cloud is definitely the more interesting part of the business from a growth perspective. It makes up less than 11% of the company's total revenue today, but is also the fastest growing part of Alphabet, with 26% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. In fact, as recently as 2018, Google Cloud made up just over 4% of the company's total sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could just be the starting point. The cloud computing market is estimated to be $676 billion in size today but is expected to roughly quadruple to $2.3 trillion by 2032. If Google Cloud can simply maintain its market share, this could be a big growth driver, but recent data indicates that Google Cloud is gaining on the market leaders.\n\nTremendous profitability and a reasonable valuation\n\nIt's also worth noting that Alphabet has about $111 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, which combined with the more than $80 billion in annualized net income it generated in the most recent quarter gives it tremendous financial flexibility to pursue opportunities as they arise.\n\nWith a valuation of about 22 times forward earnings, I wouldn't exactly call Alphabet a cheap stock, although it is easily the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven by this metric. However, it does seem attractively valued for a market-leading and highly profitable business growing revenue at a double-digit rate. Alphabet is a rare combination of a dominant core business and a rapidly growing secondary business with massive, long-tailed growth potential. And while it isn't the largest stock in the Magnificent Seven today, I wouldn't be at all shocked for that to change within the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 AI Stock to Buy Now",
        "content": "Many have called data the new oil. The digital economy runs on data. Information is crucial to digital technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And that means the world needs more infrastructure to support the movement and processing of data.\n\n\"We're in a once-in-a-generation investment cycle for data centers at the moment,\" stated Felix Chan, a speaker at Brookfield Infrastructure's (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) annual investor day last year. Chan noted that companies need to invest over $1 trillion in the next 10 years in data centers to support the growth in data consumption, driven in part by generative AI. Brookfield Infrastructure has invested heavily in building a leading data infrastructure platform, positioning it to capitalize on this opportunity. That makes it a top stock to buy now to play the coming AI-driven data center boom.\n\nAI runs on data\n\nUdhay Mathialagan, who leads Brookfield's global data center platform, stated at the same event:\n\nAI is everywhere and machine learning and AI growth has just exploded. There's lots of theories, lots of views on how AI will manifest itself, how it'll be deployed. But the one thing, the one plain truth is the only way AI can be delivered is through physical data infrastructure on the ground. And what that means is data centers and lots of them.\n\nAI needs data centers to thrive because the technology requires a tremendous amount of computing power and data storage. That computing power comes from specialized semiconductors developed by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). AI apps, including the uber-popular AI ChatBot ChatGPT by OpenAI, widely use its H100 graphics cards. Companies are buying these chips hand-over-fist to power their AI ambitions. Nvidia's data center business generated $18.4 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter, a staggering 409% increase from the prior year.\n\nThe AI boom is also driving companies to secure more space in data centers to house the technology used to train AI models and generate outputs. That's fueling a building boom that could last more than a decade. According to Brookfield's Chan, the world needs six gigawatts (GW) of additional data center capacity over the next three years to meet expected data demand. That's staggering, considering there was only 7.4 GW of capacity online at the end of last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding a leading data center platform\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure has quietly positioned itself to capitalize on the data and AI boom over the past few years. It entered the data center market in 2019. The global infrastructure operator spent $1 billion to buy a portfolio of data centers from AT&T in the U.S., creating the Evoque Data Centers platform. The company also formed a joint venture (JV) with data center REITDigital Realty that year to acquire the Ascenty data center platform in South America and has since formed another JV with Digital Realty to develop data centers in India.\n\nThe company invested in three more data center platforms last year:\n\nCompass Datacenters: The company partnered with an existing investor to acquire Compass in a $5.5 billion deal. Compass develops mega data center campuses in North America.  Data4: It entered the European data center market by acquiring Data4 for $3.8 billion. The company operates 31 data centers across six European countries.  Cyxtera: Brookfield used its Evoque platform to acquire 40 data center sites out of bankruptcy from Cyxtera. It also purchased the associated real estate of several sites from third-party landlords, including Digital Realty.\n\nBrookfield now owns interests in over 135 operating data centers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. They have 750 megawatts (MW) of critical load capacity.\n\nOn top of that, the company has contracts to support constructing another 900 megawatts of data center capacity over the next three years. That pipeline gives Brookfield a clear line of site to grow its data center platform's funds from operations (FFO) by 2.5 times over the next three years. Meanwhile, it has the potential to develop over 2.3 GW of data center capacity over the next five years and is buying more land to support future development. For example, following discussions with a customer about their growth ambitions, Brookfield Infrastructure acquired a strategic land site in Milan during the fourth quarter of last year to support over 60 MW of additional capacity.\n\nA high-powered growth driver\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure's data center investments could pay big dividends for investors over the coming years. They help support the company's view that it can grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually. That should give it the power to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.7%) by 5% to 9% per year.

        "title": "3 Dangerous Myths About Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) needs little introduction at this point. The GPU maker dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) era. It's become the third-most-valuable company in the world behind only Microsoft and Apple, and its revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter, driving even faster growth on the bottom line.\n\nNvidia stock jumped more than 500% since the start of 2023. But with its gains accelerating in the first few months of 2024, a new narrative has emerged around the stock, and with it, some pernicious myths. Some investors now believe the stock is in a bubble that will soon collapse, believing that the stock has run too high, too fast and that its profits aren't sustainable.\n\nHowever, many of the arguments that form that thesis fall apart upon closer examination. Keep reading to see three such talking points that investors should be skeptical of. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia is like Cisco in 2000\n\nThere's been no shortage of comparisons between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, and many tech CEOs have likened the disruptive potential of AI to the early days of the internet. Of the famous busts from that era, Cisco Systems sticks out as an analogue for Nvidia. Like Nvidia, Cisco was seen as the picks-and-shovels play of that period, selling routers and switches that were essential for internet connectivity.\n\nHowever, there seem to be more differences than similarities between Nvidia now and Cisco then. Nvidia's competitive advantages are more entrenched than Cisco's were, and it's been building its empire for far longer. Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999 and has been far and away the leader in the category since. It's also built an ecosystem to complement its GPU hardware family, which centers around CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a parallel computing platform it created in 2006 that enables general-purpose computing on Nvidia's GPUs. CUDA essentially functions as a software layer on top of its hardware. While Cisco was just a seller of hardware, Nvidia is selling an entire tech ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is also growing much faster than Cisco ever was during the dot-com boom. In fact, Cisco's earnings per share only increased 140% total from 1996 to 2000, about 25% annually, rising from $0.15 to $0.36 due in part to excessive share-based compensation. Additionally, Cisco's margins actually declined during that period.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, reported a 588% increase in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share in fiscal 2024, outpacing the stock's gains; its margins exploded, and its share count fell over the year.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is a much stronger company than Cisco was during the dot-com boom, and Nvidia stock hasn't gained nearly as much as Cisco did.\n\n2. Competition will erase Nvidia's AI leadership\n\nAnother core tenet of the Nvidia bear thesis is that competition will level the playing field in AI. While it's true that AI GPU competition is already arriving in the form of products like Advanced Micro Devices' MI300 and Intel's Gaudi3, AI components are not a commodity product, and this won't be a race to the bottom.\n\nBecause of assets like CUDA and libraries of prebuilt code on its Superchips, Nvidia's product line is more than just hardware. Those components effectively lock in vendors and provide a suite of tools for customers that is difficult for competitors to match.\n\nWhile competing products are likely to alleviate the current shortage of GPUs and could weigh on Nvidia's pricing, investors should also remember that the AI market continues to expand and there are new frontiers for Nvidia to penetrate.\n\nFor example, the company launched an AI PC chip in January, opening up a market that it previously hadn't contested. If Nvidia bears believe AMD and Intel will swipe market share in data center GPUs, which Nvidia currently dominates, they should also consider the prospects of Nvidia turning the tables on its rivals in PCs, their traditional bastion.\n\nMeanwhile, the market for edge computing AI chips, meaning in end-user devices, is also up for grabs, giving Nvidia a key growth opportunity there as well.\n\nCompetition is coming, but Nvidia's competitive moat is formidable, and it can penetrate new AI markets as well.\n\n3. Nvidia is overvalued\n\nIn order for Nvidia stock to be in a bubble, it has to be overvalued. By definition, a bubble means that the price of an asset has risen unsustainably because of momentum rather than fundamentals.\n\nNvidia's fundamentals, on the other hand, look rock-solid. As noted above, the company's GAAP profits jumped by nearly 7 times last year, and Wall Street consistently underestimated the company's growth along the way.\n\nIts valuation also doesn't seem irrational. The stock trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of around 75, and analysts expect earnings per share to nearly double this year, giving it a forward P/E of less than 40. Nvidia could easily top that forecast as well.\n\nBased on the company's expected growth rate and its manifest competitive advantages, that valuation seems reasonable. While the stock would certainly fall if it missed estimates, a full-on collapse based on those ratios seems unlikely.\n\nIs it safe to buy Nvidia stock?\n\nThere's still a lot of uncertainty in the developing AI market, but there's also huge potential growth even for market leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia stock has been on fire in recent months, and the stock could certainly undergo a significant correction if its results disappoint or the AI revolution doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nHowever, based on its current valuation, the competitive landscape, and the strength of the business, the stock is considerably safer than the naysayers claim, and over the long term, Nvidia's prospects continue to look bright as AI applications proliferate to areas like autonomous vehicles. And Nvidia's chips are likely to play a role in emerging technologies.\n\nWhile it's difficult to predict the short-term movements of any stock, Nvidia still looks like a long-term winner despite claims of an AI stock bubble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Is the Next \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Pay a Dividend (and It Could Be the Biggest of the Bunch)",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks aren't exactly know for their dividends but rather for their growth. But if a company's payout can grow by double digits for a large number of years, investing in leading tech growth stocks today could yield some impressive retirement income decades down the road.\n\nWhat could be even more lucrative? If you own a high-growth stock that begins to start paying a dividend after you've owned it for a number of years. When this fortunate event happens, one has probably already seen a large appreciation in the stock, so even a small nominal yield can amount to a substantial payout relative to one's initial investment.\n\nOf the three remaining Mag Seven stocks that don't pay a dividend, I'd say it's a pretty solid bet which one will be next. Not only that, but its potential payout could offer the highest yield of the group when it begins.\n\nAlphabet is a cash cow that should really pay a dividend\n\nWith exception of perhaps Apple and Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet is the Magnificent Seven stock with the greatest capacity to pay a dividend -- and yet it doesn't.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet generated a massive $74 billion in net income, which is the third highest profit figure of the Mag Seven. And if one takes out the $4.1 billion in operating losses from Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment consisting of moonshot projects, Alphabet would have come very close to Microsoft's $82.5 billion profit over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking at all the dividend-paying Mag Seven stocks side by side, it seems apparent Alphabet is rather overdue for a dividend.\n\nCompany Net Income (TTM) Dividend Yield  Payout Ratio Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $100.9 billion 0.55% 14.8% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $82.5 billion 0.71% 25.2% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) $73.8 billion 0% 0% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $39.1 billion 0.40% 13.4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $29.8 billion 0.16% 1.3%\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Alphabet have the earnings power to pay shareholders a dividend, but it also has the biggest balance sheet cushion of any Mag Seven company. As of December, Alphabet had a whopping $111 billion in cash against just $13 billion in debt. That's actually the highest level of net cash in the group. The next most cash-rich company is Apple. Although Apple has a higher level of total cash and securities at around $173 billion, it also had a higher debt load, at around $108 billion.\n\nTo its credit, Alphabet has been returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In fact, Alphabet returned nearly all of its net income to shareholders through buybacks last year, retiring $71 billion of its stock, including offsets for share compensation.\n\nBut all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also repurchasing a fair amount of stock, with most (except Microsoft) paying more in share repurchases than dividends. And with Alphabet's closest peer, Meta Platforms, just initiating its first dividend last month, Alphabet may be running out of excuses in holding out.\n\nSome may find it may be appropriate for Alphabet to stick with 100% repurchases for now. After all, Alphabet is currently the cheapest of all the Magnificent Seven stocks on both a P/E and forward P/E basis. And the cheaper a stock is, the more accretive share repurchases are, with the ability to retire more shares. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat being said, even using 100% of its earnings for repurchases would retire only about 4.5% of Alphabet's stock this year. Whereas using Microsoft's payout ratio would give shareholders a 1.1% dividend yield. That would be the highest among the Mag Seven and wouldn't be a bad yield at all for an AI-fueled tech stock. It could also open up Alphabet to a larger pool of investors, attracting dividend-focused mutual and index funds.\n\nReasons to not pay a dividend\n\nOf course, Alphabet management may be hesitant to begin paying a dividend at this point. After all, the stock has lagged other Mag Seven names based on fears that generative artificial intelligence could pose a threat to its core search business.\n\nI think that fear is misplaced, as we're still in the early innings of the AI era, and Alphabet has recently upped its game with an upgraded version of its in-house large language model called Gemini 1.5. According to the company, the new Gemini model can understand more video, text, audio, and computer code in an instant than the latest version of ChatGPT-4. In fact, it was recently rumored that Apple is in talks to license Gemini for iPhones, much in the way Apple already has Google as the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nYet while there are positive signs Alphabet's AI products are gaining traction, the buildout of Gemini, Google Cloud, and general AI capabilities will take lots of capital. Therefore, Alphabet may be in for an aggressive spending cycle to capture the AI opportunity that may necessitate management holding off on paying a regular dividend at this point in time.\n\nStill, the buildout of AI infrastructure and the Metaverse investment didn't prevent Meta from starting its own dividend. Two years ago, Meta management was criticized for overspending, so the new nominal payout was perhaps a gesture to shareholders that Meta will remain disciplined in its investments.\n\nAlphabet has also been criticized as perhaps being a bit bloated in terms of its employee count and spending on various \"moonshot\" tech projects. So, the initiation of a dividend could go a long way in changing that perception for Alphabet as well.\n\nA dividend is probably coming at some point\n\nOnce Alphabet management believes its AI offerings have gained sufficient traction, I would expect the company to perhaps begin a quarterly payout.\n\nWhile it may not happen in 2024, investors in Alphabet today are likely to see a growing payout beginning sometime in the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's 1 Irrefutable Reason Nvidia's Stock Gains Will Slow Dramatically",
        "content": "Going parabolic. There's no better way to describe Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock performance since late 2022. Over the last 18 months, the chipmaker's shares have skyrocketed more than 7x.\n\nThose jaw-dropping gains have led many investors to question how long Nvidia can keep the sizzling momentum going. The answer: Not for too much longer. Here's one irrefutable reason why Nvidia's stock gains will slow dramatically.\n\nIt's simple\n\nIn 1986, the late economist Herbert Stein stated, \"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\" This came to be known as Stein's Law. And it's unquestionably true.\n\nStein's Law applies to Nvidia. The GPU maker's share price can't continue rising at the rate we've seen over the last year and a half. Why do I make this claim? Simple math.\n\nNvidia's market cap currently stands above $2.2 trillion. If the stock continued to rise at the same pace as it has since late 2022, the company would be worth more than $16 trillion by the fourth quarter of next year. That amount is higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) of every country in the world except the U.S. and China, which had GDPs in 2023 of nearly $27 trillion and $17.7 trillion, respectively.\n\nIf Nvidia's shares somehow managed to continue vaulting higher at the current rate for another 18 months beyond 2025 Q4, the company's market cap would be in the ballpark of $117 trillion. That's greater than the entire world GDP last year of $104 trillion.\n\nRegardless of how bullish anyone might be about the potential for artificial intelligence (AI), there's no way Nvidia's size will eclipse the global GDP within the next three years. The stock's momentum can't go on forever, so it won't. Thank you, Herbert Stein.\n\nSlowing doesn't necessarily mean declining\n\nNvidia's stock gains will slow dramatically in the not-too-distant future. However, it's important to understand that slowing doesn't necessarily mean declining.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, some investors believe that Nvidia stock is a bubble waiting to burst. And that could happen. NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran, one of the world's most eminent stock valuation experts, estimates that Nvidia's market cap is already more than twice its fair value.\n\nIt's not a certainty that Nvidia's share price will fall, though. One especially bullish Wall Street analyst thinks the stock can soar another 56% over the next 12 months. While that's significantly slower growth than what Nvidia has delivered recently, it's still quite good.\n\nBut that lone analyst's rosy price target for Nvidia is an outlier. The average price target among the 46 analysts surveyed by LSEG in March reflects the consensus that the stock is nearly at its ceiling for the near term.\n\nCathie Wood is right\n\nCathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Invest, cheered Nvidia for years. In 2023, though, she began reducing her funds' stake in the AI stock. That decision hasn't panned out so well for Wood since Nvidia's share price continued to rise. But while Wood's timing was off, I think her reasoning was right.\n\nArk Invest published a report in August 2023 that stated:\n\nWhile we believe Nvidia is likely to remain a prime enabler and beneficiary of continued breakthroughs in AI, many other potential beneficiaries are not well understood, may sell at much lower valuations, and potentially could deliver significant revenue and earnings surprises on the high side of expectations.\n\nI think that's the correct take. Nvidia will likely remain an AI leader for a long time to come. Investors who are looking for multi-baggers, though, can find other AI stocks with more room to run. Nvidia's days of going parabolic will end. It's irrefutable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Is Sounding the Alarm on Nvidia. Here Are 3 Things Smart Investors Should Know",
        "content": "Companies of all sizes are scrambling to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). From data centers, semiconductor chips, cloud computing, and large language models (LLMs), the prospects of generative AI has no bounds.\n\nAt the center of all the action sits Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). After adding one-trillion dollars of market cap in less than two months, it's clear that investors cannot get enough of Nvidia stock.\n\nArk Invest CEO and outspoken technology investor Cathie Wood penned a shareholder letter earlier this month outlining why she sees some turbulence ahead for Nvidia. Let's break down Wood's argument and assess the warning signs she's posing.\n\nA cautionary tale\n\nIn her shareholder letter, Wood makes an apt comparison between Nvidia and Cisco. During the early days of the internet in the 1990s, Cisco enjoyed an extended moment in the spotlight thanks to the company's breakthroughs in routers and computer hardware equipment.\n\nUnsurprisingly, investors poured into Cisco stock, eventually propelling Cisco to the world's most-valuable company. Today, Cisco isn't even in the top-50 most-valuable companies measured by market cap.\n\nOn the surface, I understand the comparison Wood makes. Demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is abnormally high thanks to urgency-driven investments surrounding the AI narrative.\n\nWood warns that rising competition could spell trouble for Nvidia, and it could be here sooner than later. While this may be true, I'm not completely sold on this argument. Understanding the underlying details around increased competition is important for investors to explore. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCompetition is rising, but...\n\nIn the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, Cisco failed to innovate at the same pace as its competition. As a result, computing hardware became a commoditized product, putting Cisco in somewhat of an existential crisis. While Cisco still operates a successful business, it's clear the company ultimately dropped out of favor with investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nI see things much differently with Nvidia. For starters, designing semiconductor chips and high-performance compute is much more sophisticated than producing routers. In other words, while Cisco's hardware was innovative in the early days of the internet, it didn't take long for competing products to emerge.\n\nNvidia absolutely has competition -- namely, from chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm. Moreover, tangential competition is quickly entering the scene from the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and even Tesla. While I agree with Wood that intensified competition could impact demand for Nvidia's chips, I don't think she's giving the company enough credit.\n\nInvestors should realize that unlike Cisco, Nvidia has optionality. The company is diversifying its model outside of semiconductors and is building an end-to-end AI platform.\n\n...Nvidia has a plan\n\nAlthough the chip arena has a rising number of entrants, Nvidia still holds a competitive advantage. The company is a pioneer in the GPU space, providing Nvidia with an enviable first-mover position. While it's plausible that Nvidia could lose some of its pricing power and market share over time, I don't see the competition as too much of a threat.\n\nMoreover, with a whopping $26 billion of cash on the balance sheet, Nvidia has been aggressively investing in all sorts of areas across the AI spectrum in an effort to expand beyond chips. Two high-profile applications that Nvidia is exploring include humanoid robotics and enterprise software.\n\nNvidia recently joined OpenAI, Microsoft, and Intel in a $675 million funding round for robotics start-up Figure AI. On top of that, the company is currently an investor in Databricks -- the world's most-valuable privately held software business. I see both of these partnerships as ways for Nvidia to bolster its under-the-radar software operation -- which is already a one-billion-dollar revenue run rate business.\n\nCould Nvidia end up as the next Cisco? Of course, anything is possible. I think what's more likely is that if Nvidia's bets in robotics and software don't pan out, then the company could begin to experience decelerating growth. A situation like that could absolutely cause some panic-induced selling from investors.\n\nBut in my opinion, I don't see that happening. I am encouraged and impressed by all of the moves Nvidia is making outside of chips. While the stock is certainly enjoying some momentum, I think Nvidia can keep it up -- and I'm optimistic that the company's best days are ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 index has roared higher over the past 16 months, rebounding from its bear market low to reach record levels -- and confirm a new bull market. And the movement has been led by one group of stocks in particular. Dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\" in reference to the 1960 Western, these players are technology stocks, and each one is a leader in its specialty area.\n\nSome investors may worry that after these gains, it's too late to get in on these stock market stars. The concern is they may have become too expensive and are ready to stagnate or fall. But a stock with spectacular momentum still could have plenty of room to run if the company has strong long-term prospects. And that's the case of some of today's top-performing stocks. Let's check out two Magnificent Seven companies to buy hand over fist right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) sells the world's top-performing artificial intelligence (AI) chip, the H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) that powers crucial operations such as the training and inference of AI models. This has helped Nvidia's revenue and net income soar in the triple digits in recent times and reach record levels. And it's also helped the shares to soar more than 240% over the past year.\n\nOf course, rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel exist in this market, but so far Nvidia has shown it has what it takes to stay ahead. And at the company's GTC AI Conference this week, chief executive officer Jensen Huang announced product launches and updates that offer us reason to be optimistic.\n\nOne particular bit of news was especially noteworthy, and that's the upcoming release of Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and chips. The platform, available later this year, will help customers run generative AI on large language models (LLMs) at a cost and energy consumption level 25 times lower than its predecessor.\n\nChief executive officers of the biggest tech companies from MetaPlatforms to Tesla commented on the Blackwell announcement -- showing that they're on board to use the platform. \"There is currently nothing better than NVIDIA hardware for AI,\" Tesla's Elon Musk said in Nvidia's Blackwell launch statement. And the biggest cloud companies said they're ready to make the technology available to customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this signals a new era of growth ahead for this chip giant, meaning that, trading at 36x times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia still looks like a buy today.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a great tech stock to buy now because it's already benefiting and is set to benefit from three growth areas: e-commerce, cloud computing, and AI. The company is a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing services, and it's investing heavily in AI to boost earnings in both of those businesses.\n\nFirst, AI aside, Amazon has become an e-commerce giant and continues to build its position thanks to its Prime subscription service, offering members many benefits that keep them coming back. AI has the potential to lower Amazon's costs and improve the shopping experience for customers -- and that could translate into earnings growth. Amazon uses AI to streamline e-commerce operations, find the best delivery routes to shorten delivery times, and uses AI to help customers find the products they need. And these are just a few examples.\n\nThrough Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud business, Amazon offers a broad range of services to its customers, and these services include just about every aspect of AI: from chips to power the training of LLMs to a fully managed service that allows customers to customize top existing LLMs. Since AWS already is a cloud leader, chances are when its customers are interested in launching an AI project, they'll do that right there on AWS.\n\nSo, Amazon is using AI to improve its operations and save time and money -- and it's selling AI services to customers. And this means it could score a double victory in the area of AI.\n\nConsidering this and Amazon's long track record of earnings growth, the stock, trading for 42x times forward earnings estimates, looks like one to buy hand over fist today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Call Me Crazy: I'd Invest in McDonald's Over Nvidia",
        "content": "Graphics-chip maker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) seems like it can do no wrong these days. With its shares soaring past $900 recently, it wouldn't be surprising to see them reach $1,000 soon. This is extraordinary considering shares were trading at less than $50 just five years ago. The semiconductor specialist, which has been benefiting from the boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI) as companies race to buy up its advanced AI chips, has become the ultimate Wall Street darling.\n\nNvidia shares undoubtedly deserved a big run-up given the chip-maker's stellar business performance. The tech company's revenue soared 126% year over year in fiscal 2024, fueled by a 217% increase in its data center revenue. But the degree of the stock's astronomical gains merits some skepticism.\n\nTo help illustrate the risks inherent in Nvidia shares today, I'd go as far as to say that even McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) may be a more attractive long-term investment from here. The boring and mature fast-food burger chain's more conservative valuation and predictable business arguably combine to make a superior value proposition for investors compared to Nvidia. While I recognize this may shock or even aggravate some Nvidia bulls, please hear me out. This isn't a pitch for Nvidia shareholders to sell but rather a reminder that not every stock is right for everyone.\n\nValuation risk\n\nOn the surface, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio of 77 seems more than justified by the company's fundamentals. Not only did revenue more than double in fiscal 2024 but earnings per share soared 586%. With growth like this, investors may conclude that the company can easily grow into its stock's valuation.\n\nBut investors have to give some weight to the possibility of AI chip demand slowing in the future and Nvidia's operating profit margin taking a big hit. One main reason for the outsize gains in Nvidia's earnings compared to its revenue was a huge improvement in operating margin. Surging sales led to Nvidia's operating margin increasing from about 34% in fiscal 2023 to approximately 61% in fiscal 2024. While it's encouraging to see the company's operating margin increase, such a large boost in margin means there's a risk of some moderate or even significant reversion for the key profitability metric at some point in the future. If supply and demand for Nvidia's data center products become more balanced over time, for instance, unit sales growth could slow, chip prices could come down, and operating margin could compress all at the same time. There's a risk, therefore, that future circumstances could lead investors to be more hesitant about paying 77 times earnings for the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompare this to McDonald's, with its far more conservative price-to-earnings ratio of 24 and its more consistent operating margins. To its credit, the operating margin at McDonald's has expanded from 42% before COVID to 46% today. But given how much slower and smaller its operating margin expansion has been than Nvidia's, any reversion to the burger chain's pre-COVID operating margin levels would likely occur at a slow and manageable pace (manageable for both management and investors) and would have a much smaller negative impact on profits. McDonald's investors, therefore, would likely have plenty of time to react to the changing environment and they'd probably be compensated by the fast food king's long-standing dividend (currently yielding 2.3%) while they re-evaluate the stock's long-term prospects.\n\nVisibility risk\n\nFurther, most people would likely agree that the pace of disruption and change is much faster in semiconductors than it is in fast food -- particularly when comparing market leaders of both industries. To illustrate, look at the rise and fall of Intel stock, which reflects how the company's once-dominant industry leadership has been easily eroded away by competitors like Nvidia, Broadcom, and others. Long gone are the days of Intel's leadership. Over the last five years, Intel stock has declined 20% and Nvidia shares have risen more than 2,000%.\n\nMeanwhile, McDonald's has easily sustained a leadership position as a global restaurant chain for decades. Not only has its stock increased more than 50% over the past five years while paying meaningful (and growing) quarterly dividends to shareholders the whole time, but the underlying business continues to grow rapidly. Today, its strong growth persists. Gobal comparable restaurant sales rose 9% year over year in 2023 and increased 30% since 2019. The company's scale, customer loyalty, and consistent service across its stores have created a wide and highly predictable \"moat\" for the business that keeps customers coming back and competitors at bay.\n\nIt's safe to say that McDonald's has an easier-to-predict business than Nvidia. The likelihood of a new competitor disrupting the burger chain is much lower than it is for a competition to make inroads on Nvidia's semiconductor leadership. Further, the ramifications of potential negative outcomes, like Nvidia giving up its big lead over competition or slowing sales, could be disastrous for the stock given the risk of significant margin compression and the growth stock's high valuation.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I could be drastically underestimating Nvidia. Indeed, there's probably a high chance I am. However, history in the tech sector (particularly in the semiconductor industry) shows that there is a high level of unpredictability regarding how competitive dynamics can play out over time. For this reason, I firmly believe there's greater visibility into the business at McDonald's than Nvidia -- enough difference that I'd rather bet on McDonald's stock.\n\nSure, I would consider investing in Nvidia at the right price. But that price would have to be very attractive, leaving a meaningful margin of safety in my calculations about the company's potential future. In other words, I'd consider buying Nvidia stock if I believed it traded at a significant discount to my estimate of its fair value. But its current price is far above the levels I'd need to see it trade at before shares seemed to trade with a sufficient margin of safety.\n\nRisk and reward go hand in hand\n\nThis isn't to say that McDonald's stock will outperform Nvidia stock over the long haul. Instead, the point is that risk and reward go hand in hand. I'd argue that the potential reward investors can achieve from McDonald's stock relative to the underlying risk of owning it makes for an overall better value proposition than Nvidia stock's current risk-reward profile.\r\n\r\nOne final point: investors should remember that they don't need to invest in every hot stock. It's OK to sit on the sidelines and not participate in an investment if it seems too risky to them. Every investor is different. I, for example, would rather choose a stock with less valuation risk and more visibility than Nvidia -- even if this means missing out on big potential gains. In the meantime, I'll sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show without judging those who have chosen to invest in Nvidia stock. Many people have higher risk tolerances than me and that's OK.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's Why We Think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Is Well Worth Watching",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Fast Is NVIDIA Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$1.76 to US$12.09 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. NVIDIA shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 21% to 54%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for NVIDIA's future EPS 100% free.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of NVIDIA, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$92b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nIs NVIDIA Worth Keeping An Eye On?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. Even so, be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by recent insider purchases.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood predicted a $2,000 per share price for Tesla by 2027 on anticipated demand for its self-driving platform. That forecast has occurred as falling demand for EVs and lower gross margins hamper its stock, which is down 30% in 2024.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is not invincible, it has not shown any signs of slowing so far. Hence, before assuming that Nvidia will follow Tesla's lead, investors should consider these points.\n\n1. Differences between the two businesses\n\nInvestors should remember that it has only been in recent years that investors viewed Nvidia and Tesla as potential competitors. Tesla was long seen as an automaker and a battery company, and even now, car sales make up most of the company's revenue.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, some analysts paid more attention to Tesla's self-driving platform. In this regard, Tesla has made an unusual and intriguing decision. Rather than turning to Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices for the chips to power the platform, Tesla developed AI chips, software, and robotics in-house.\n\nNvidia focuses more heavily on AI chips, primarily with data centers. Although automotive makes up a tiny fraction of its revenue, its product line includes three different chips tailored to driver assistance and full self-driving. Additionally, it offers software packages, including an operating system and neural network.\n\nNvidia credited Tesla with \"raising the bar.\" One has to assume Tesla is the industry leader in this niche. Nonetheless, Nvidia argues that it offers the only platform on which the auto industry can build.\n\nIn truth, both companies have work to do in this area to achieve full self-driving. Still, with Nvidia's focus in the data center, it seems like it will perform regardless of whether it can develop a competitive advantage in the auto industry.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Effects on financials\n\nNot surprisingly, differing focal points have naturally led to divergent financial results.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), Nvidia's revenue of $61 billion surged 126% higher over the previous year, leading to a net income of $31 billion, a 581% yearly rise. Given such results, the massive gains in Nvidia stock seem less surprising.\n\nIn contrast, Tesla's lower margins may have weighed on Tesla's growth rate, at least in the near term. In 2023, revenue grew at an annual rate of 19% to $97 billion. That sounds promising until you consider that it delivered 38% more cars, meaning that gross margins fell from 26% to 18% during that time. Such results may dim the optimism about generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income, which rose 19% to $15 billion.\n\n3. The mixed signals coming from valuations\n\nDespite Nvidia's strong financial performance, investors may not know what to make of the differing valuation metrics between the two companies.\n\nDue to Nvidia's rising stock price, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio increased to about 37. This is a high level even for a company experiencing massive growth, but it likely reflects the excitement boosting the stock.\n\nIn contrast, Tesla currently sells at a P/S ratio of 6. This is not a record low for Tesla, as the sales multiple fell below 2 in 2019, right before the pandemic. Still, the P/S ratio is at its lowest level since 2020, and may lead some investors to question how much more downside there is for Tesla stock.\n\nNonetheless, despite Tesla's recent decline, the company trades at a forward P/E ratio of 54 as price cuts and slimmer gross margins begin to reduce profitability. Interestingly, Nvidia's rapid earnings growth translates into a forward P/E ratio of just 37. Such a multiple may imply that Nvidia may have an advantage despite recent gains.\n\nUltimately, investors should take both the P/S ratio and forward P/E ratio into account. However, since earnings tend to influence stock prices more directly, the metrics seem to place Nvidia in a more favorable light than Tesla.\n\nWill Nvidia crash like Tesla?\n\nGiven current conditions, Nvidia stock will probably not decline to the same extent as Tesla anytime soon. Indeed, competition and an inevitable downturn in the chip industry could eventually undermine Nvidia. Still, with demand so strong for AI chips, such a scenario will likely not affect Nvidia in the foreseeable future.\n\nTesla faces a more uncertain path. For now, slimmer margins on auto sales will pressure the company. Also, it is unclear when (or if) Tesla's full self-driving platform will take over all driving functions and attract customers. So, while Tesla stock could eventually come back, investors should not expect such a recovery in the near term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Any conversation about artificial intelligence (AI) would, of necessity, include Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that underpin many of the world's most advanced AI models and continues to innovate at a breakneck pace.\n\nAt the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which kicked off on Sunday in San Jose, California, Nvidia unveiled several startling developments on Monday that suggest the AI revolution is only just beginning. What came out of the conference bolsters the argument for investing in this company. Here are three reasons to buy Nvidia stock like there is no tomorrow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia unveiled the next \"must-have\" AI processor\n\nWhen ChatGPT burst on the scene in late 2022, the race to adopt generative AI was on. The potential to leverage these next-generation AI models to boost productivity had businesses scrambling to figure out how best to profit from these developments in AI. The processor that enabled these advances was Nvidia's H100 Tensor Core GPU, which could train large language models (LLMs) up to 30 times faster than its previous generation of AI chips. Now, those processors are so last year.\n\nOn Monday, Nvidia unveiled the Blackwell platform \"to power a new era of computing.\" The Blackwell B200 Tensor Core GPU is the \"world's most powerful chip\" for AI, according to CEO Jensen Huang. The processor is packed with 208 billion transistors (up from 80 billion in the H100), delivering five times the performance. The architecture combines two tightly integrated GPUs that act in concert with each other. The Blackwell GPU can scale up to 10 trillion parameters. For context, GPT-3, the LLM behind ChatGPT, had just 175 billion parameters.\n\nFurthermore, the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip combines two B200 chips, a Grace CPU, and an NVLink high-speed interconnect, which makes all the parts act in concert. The AI-centric processor offers up to 30 times the performance of its predecessor while reducing energy consumption by up to 25 times.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Cloud providers are lining up to buy Nvidia products\n\nMuch like Nvidia's previous AI-centric processors, the largest cloud infrastructure providers are lining up to deliver its latest offerings via the cloud.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) announced it will offer the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said, \"marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing.\"\n\nIt was also revealed that Microsoft would be \"one of the first organizations to bring the power of Nvidia Grace Blackwell GB200\" to its Azure Cloud. The company said that Nvidia processors would provide AI predictions to Microsoft Copilot, its generative AI-powered digital assistant. Not to be left out, Alphabet said that the company would adopt the Blackwell platform, with \"Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud coming to Google Cloud.\"\n\nThis was just the tip of the iceberg, as Nvidia announced collaborations with several of the biggest names in technology, including Oracle, Dell Technologies, and Meta Platforms, among many others.\n\n3. It's not just about the hardware for Nvidia\n\nNvidia made a name for itself by creating the processors that power AI, but it isn't stopping there.\n\nThe company introduced Nvidia Inference Manager (NIM), a groundbreaking software platform that helps developers streamline the creation and deployment of AI systems. Nvidia will provide pre-built and optimized AI models that businesses can adapt using their first-party data. This way, companies don't need to reinvent the wheel, significantly reducing the amount of time needed to deploy AI. These tools will help smaller companies that don't have the resources of the aforementioned tech giants to adopt and implement AI.\n\nThis helps illustrate Nvidia's strategy, which increasingly involves full hardware and software packages to help businesses succeed.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nEven with a seemingly insurmountable lead in the space, Nvidia continues to innovate at a breakneck pace and take AI processing to the next level. This is evident from the company's performance and its soaring stock price, which has surged more than 500% since the beginning of 2023, which marked the advent of generative AI.\n\nDespite those gains, there are many who believe -- myself included -- that this is just the beginning and that the accelerating adoption of AI will continue to bolster the fortunes of Nvidia and its shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, at just 36 times next year's earnings, Nvidia stock is a steal relative to its opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget SoundHound AI: Here Are 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Undervalued",
        "content": "SoundHound AI has been red-hot on the stock market in 2024, with stunning gains of 288% so far. Investors have been buying shares of this voice artificial intelligence (AI) solutions provider hand over fist based on the belief that it could become the next big AI play.\n\nThe company's revenue has been growing at an impressive pace, and it also boasts of a solid pipeline that could help it sustain its red-hot growth in the future. What's more, SoundHound AI stock has got a vote of confidence from AI pioneer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has a small stake in the company. This is a big reason why shares of SoundHound have simply taken off in the past month or so.\n\nHowever, investors looking to buy an AI stock right now may not be comfortable paying 42 times sales for SoundHound, which is way higher than the tech sector's average of 7.1. Of course, it may become a key player in the AI market in the long run, but SoundHound AI is currently quite small, and is far from being profitable. Instead, investors would do well to buy shares of the following two established AI companies, which appear to be undervalued.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nYou may be wondering how Nvidia is an undervalued AI stock -- it is trading at 36 times sales, which isn't very cheap when compared to SoundHound. But a closer look at how fast Nvidia has been growing will make it clear that investors are indeed getting a good deal on the stock right now.\n\nNvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Jan. 28, 2024) jumped a whopping 265% year over year. Its adjusted earnings grew at a faster pace of 486% year over year to $5.16 per share. For comparison, SoundHound AI's revenue was up 80% year over year in the previous quarter to $17.1 million, while its adjusted loss halved on a year-over-year basis to $0.07 per share.\n\nWhat's even more impressive about Nvidia is that the chipmaker's outstanding growth is probably here to stay. Its revenue guidance of $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 means that Nvidia's revenue is on track to more than triple once again from the year-ago period's level of $7.2 billion. Analysts have been quick to raise their growth estimates. They expect Nvidia's earnings to nearly triple in the space of just three fiscal years from fiscal 2024 levels of $12.96 per share.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThis prediction of rapid growth in Nvidia's earnings is precisely the reason why the stock is trading at attractive forward earnings multiples. This is evident from the chart below: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nAt 30 times its fiscal 2027 earnings, buying Nvidia stock is a no-brainer right now, as it is trading almost in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 29 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Another clear indicator of Nvidia's undervaluation is its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.13; this is a forward-looking valuation metric that helps understand how cheap a stock is relative to the growth it is expected to deliver.\n\nTraditionally, a stock with a PEG ratio of less than 1 is undervalued. Nvidia's PEG ratio is well below that mark. All this indicates that investors should consider buying Nvidia hand over fist, as it is in a solid position to capitalize on the lucrative long-term growth opportunity present in AI chips and deliver healthy gains in the long run.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is trading at 10 times sales and 26 times trailing earnings. That means shares of the foundry giant are way cheaper than shares of both Nvidia and SoundHound AI.\n\nConsidering the critical role that TSMC is playing in enabling the AI chip revolution, investors would do well to get their hands on the stock before it becomes expensive. After all, Nvidia wouldn't have been able to run away with the AI semiconductor market without TSMC's help. Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, which means that it simply designs the chips but doesn't manufacture them. TSMC, Nvidia's foundry partner, does the actual manufacturing of the AI chips.\n\nIt is worth noting that TSMC is the world's largest foundry company, with a massive share of 61%. That's well ahead of second-place Samsung's share of 11%. With the AI chip market predicted to clock 38% annual growth through 2030, TSMC's dominant position in the foundry space puts it in an advantageous position to capitalize on the growth opportunity on offer.\n\nThat's especially true considering that the leading AI chip players are TSMC's customers. From Nvidia to AMD to Intel, multiple chipmakers are lining up to buy chips made using TSMC's advanced manufacturing processes. This is the reason why TSMC is focused on aggressively enhancing its monthly manufacturing capacity of AI chips so that it can meet the growing demand from multiple customers.\n\nAs a result, it wouldn't be surprising to see TSMC growing at a faster pace than the market's expectations in 2024 and beyond. This is probably why TSMC's consensus earnings estimates have been heading higher. TSM EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAssuming TSMC does manage to hit $9 per share in earnings in 2026 and trades at 29 times earnings at that time (in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple), its stock price could jump to $261. That would be a 91% jump from TSMC's current stock price.\n\nTSMC's current earnings multiple is lower than the Nasdaq-100's average, which means that investors are getting a solid deal on this AI stock right now. They may not want to miss this opportunity given the impressive gains the stock could deliver over the next three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Corporate Insiders are Dumping These 11 Tech Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Corporate Insiders are Dumping These 5 Tech Stocks.\n\nThe US stock market is on track to conclude a solid week on Friday, as the Federal Reserve’s latest statement saying it’s still targeting three rate cuts this year soothed investors’ nerves. However, many analysts have been repeatedly saying that the overall performance of the stock market would be lukewarm this year as they think the AI-fueled rally has already gone too far and the market needs a breather. UBS recently said in a note that investors should not be “surprised” by a pullback in the short term because of high valuations. However, UBS sees any decline in stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nLast month, when most of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks slipped, market experts pointed to huge crowding around mega-cap tech stocks and high expectations of investors as the reasons behind the pullback.  A report by the Wall Street Journal quoted George Maris, global equities chief investment officer at Principal Asset Management, who said that because there are “so many people that have crowded” into mega-cap tech stocks, expectations of the market have gone through the roof. The analyst said investors hit the exit button on “anything” that they perceive is not “bulletproof.”\n\nBlackRock also said in one of its March updates that while it’s highly bullish on US stocks, stretched valuations means investors would have to be “choosy” while picking stocks. BlackRock also said that it’s time to look beyond the “first layer” of AI tech stack — the obvious names like chips, data centers and infrastructure — and focus on companies that would benefit from the AI revolution in various other sectors. These include companies that mine, process and store data, according to BlackRock. Corporate Insiders are Dumping These Tech Stocks\n\nPhoto by AlphaTradeZone\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this backdrop, it’s important to see which tech stocks are being dumped by corporate insiders. For this article we first used Insider Monkey’s stock screener to identify all tech stocks that saw insider selling activity over the past few weeks and picked 11 companies with the highest insider selling activity from insiders (executives, officers, directors) in terms of dollar value. Some top names in the list include Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Squarespace Inc (NYSE:SQSP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nWebsite building platform company Squarespace Inc (NYSE:SQSP) ranks 11th in our list of the tech stocks with recent insider selling. Squarespace Inc'S (NYSE:SQSP) CEO Anthony Casalena on March 6 sold 131,480 shares of Squarespace Inc (NYSE:SQSP) at $31.80 per share. Since then the stock has gained about 11.76%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 24 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Squarespace Inc (NYSE:SQSP). The most notable stake in Squarespace Inc (NYSE:SQSP) is owned by Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group which owns a $73 million stake in Squarespace Inc (NYSE:SQSP).\n\n10. Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) has been skyrocketing this year as the company keeps getting strong commercial orders and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) short sellers continue to get hit. However, Palantir Technologies Inc's (NYSE:PLTR) cofounder Peter Thiel on March 12 sold about seven million shares of Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) at $24.79 per share. The stock is down by just 0.8% since then.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)’s stock moved higher on hopes that it could win business from the U.K.’s National Health Services and as customer counts grew rapidly in the latest quarterly report for the company’s new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir also won a significant new contract with the U.S. Army in September, which should last through 2026. The debate on the street is how fast Palantir can monetize its new commercial customers. After the quarter closed, the company announced an enhanced marketing deal with a major auditing and consulting firm.”\n\n9. Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nSearch-powered solutions software company Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC) ranks ninth in our list of the tech stocks with recent insider selling activity. Elastic NV'S (NYSE:ESTC) CTO  Shay Banon on March 18 sold 280,000 shares of Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC) at $101.41 per share.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023,45 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC). The biggest stakeholder of Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC) during this period was Alex Sacerdote’s Whale Rock Capital Management which owns a $273 million stake in Elastic NV (NYSE:ESTC). Since then the stock has slipped by just about 0.6%.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Across the Information Technology universe, we seek companies possessing differentiated capabilities, products, and services. Turning to positives, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is a data analytics company, engaged in open-source search and analytics engine services. Its shares jumped 27% on strong fiscal first quarter results with beats across billings, revenues, and earnings. Management noted they are benefiting from the trend of vendor consolidation.”\n\n8. Coupang Inc (NYSE:CPNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 53\n\nEcommerce company Coupang Inc (NYSE:CPNG) saw insider selling activity this month when one of its board directors, Neil Mehta, sold 1.6 million shares of Coupang Inc (NYSE:CPNG) at $18.68 apiece. The insider selling transaction took place on March 14. Since then the stock has lost about 0.5% in value. In addition to Coupage, insiders are also selling Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also took advantage of stock price volatility and slightly added to several existing positions: The Korean e-commerce platform, Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), whose stock corrected during the quarter following a miss on EBITDA margins, which we don’t view as structural. The company continues to gain market share while holding significant competitive advantages thanks to its robust delivery network.”\n\n7. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nDell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) saw heavy insider selling activity this month. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) CEO Michael Dell dumped 2,977,478 shares of Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) on March 19 at $108.52 per share. The stock has jumped about 6% since then.\n\nLast month Dell stock soared after Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) posted strong Q4 results that were aided by upbeat demand for Dell Technologies Inc's (NYSE:DELL) AI servers. During its Q4 earning call Dell's management talked about AI-related opportunities and their impact on business:\n\n\"We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers and the projected growth in unstructured data where we are well-positioned with industry-leading storage solutions. We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure. PCs will become even more essential as most day-to-day work with AI will be done on the PC. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in our CSG business. Look for us to make a number of new product and solution announcements at Dell Technology World in May that will help customers get started with AI and make it easy. Turning to Q4, we saw positive signs in the business as we exited the year, but enterprise and large customers remained cautious with their spend.\n\nOur Q4 execution was solid given the environment with ISG faring better than CSG. We delivered revenue of $22.3 billion with strong profitability and cash flow. Operating income was $2.1 billion. Diluted EPS was $2.20, and cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. In ISG, traditional server demand grew year-over-year and a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth, and storage demand grew above normal seasonality, though down year-over-year as expected. Storage recovery typically lags servers by a couple of quarters. Our strong momentum in the AI build-out continues as we believe Dell is uniquely positioned with our broad portfolio to help customers build Gen-AI solutions that meet their performance, cost, and security requirements. In Q4, we saw strength across a wider range of customers and geographies within expanding pipeline.\n\nAI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 62\n\nDwight Merriman, one of the founders of database company Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) and now a director at Mongodb Inc's (NASDAQ:MDB) board, on March 1 dumped 8,000 shares of Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) at $433.31 per share. Since then through March 21 the stock has lost about 18%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 62 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB). The biggest stake in Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $281 million stake in Mongodb Inc (NASDAQ:MDB).

        "title": "3 Stocks With the Most Potential to Upstage the Magnificent 7 in 2024",
        "content": "Not all Magnificent Seven stocks have been pulling their fair share of the weight this year. Undoubtedly, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may still be in its early stages. And while each one of the Magnificent members seems well-positioned to capture the market opportunity, none are better equipped than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe GPU maker has been cashing in on the early days of the AI boom. At this pace, it’s hard to envision the other six members of the Magnificent Seven coming close to the type of numbers Nvidia has been posting.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s lead seems to be widening by the week, it’s still unclear which stocks will be magnificent in the next quarter, let alone next year. AI innovation is moving so fast that acronyms, such as the Magnificent Seven, stand to be outdated rather quickly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJim Cramer’s famed FAANG acronym lasted for quite a while. But with the Magnificent Seven concentrated on just a handful of winners, questions linger as to whether a new acronym is needed to describe America’s best and brightest companies. I think it is. And if a new group were to be crafted, I’d put the following three stocks in that basket.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe recent jaw-dropping performance of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is what IPO investors dream of when they look to pick up their first few shares of a new issue. Undoubtedly, it’s quite rare to see such a profound IPO skyrocket in the year that follows. Too many new issues tend to land on the public markets at rather hot, even inflated prices, at the high end of the pricing range.\n\nAt writing, Arm stock is up around 160% from its $61.00 per share IPO price. The capital-light semiconductor play, which licenses out its chip designs, is potentially better positioned for the coming AI boom. More so than many early skeptics may have anticipated. Undoubtedly, there was likely a reason why Nvidia unsuccessfully chased down the firm a while back.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs generative AI falls from the cloud to our desktop and handheld devices, energy-efficient hardware to get models running will be key. At 83.3 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and around 45.9 times price-to-sales (P/S), shares appear undeniably expensive on the surface. However, when it comes to AI chip plays, what seems expensive today may not be so next year.\n\nWhile nobody knows if Arm’s future holds Nvidia-esque surprises, I do view the firm as a top candidate for inclusion in whichever buzzy acronym succeeds the Magnificent Seven.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs profits spread from AI chips to the enterprise software scene, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stands out as a top beneficiary. If the company’s AI-savvy televised commercials featuring Matthew McConaughey don’t convince you, perhaps new value-adding AI services like Einstein Copilot will.\n\nThe company’s customer relationship management (CRM) platform is poised to get a steady flow of new AI innovations and features. Top boss Marc Benioff sees AI as a potential boon to Salesforce’s business. I do not doubt the man as he looks to evolve his firm for the AI age.\n\nFurther, look for the Slack factor to shine in the AI era. Salesforce’s Slack deal’s timing was certainly not perfect. However, with the AI bull market taking hold, I’m looking back on the acquisition as one of Benioff’s brightest moves.\n\nSlack is at the absolute center of the enterprise — I don’t think there’s any denying that. Moving ahead, Slack will allow Salesforce to “floor it” with AI expansion as it equips customers with its own AI copilot.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) A photo of a person holding a smartphone in a car that is displaying the Uber Technologies Inc (UBER) logo.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUberTechnologies (NYSE:UBER) is one of the year’s hottest stocks, now up around 38% year to date. As impressive as the ride-hailing giant’s surge has been, I do see many ways the firm can extend its rally. It might just hit the $100 per share milestone.\n\nAs the company goes electric, subtly nudging users to choose electric vehicle (EVs), we’ll see Uber become an ESG-flavored play. Add its recently launched “Emissions Saving” data to the app, and it’s clear Uber is both the most convenient way to travel and one of the more eco-friendly options out there.\n\nAside from EVs, look for Uber to find other ways to improve customers’ experiences, beyond just ride-hailing or food-delivery. At the pace of margin improvement, the $166.6 billion transportation titan deserves a spot in the next big high-growth cohort.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Salesforce.

        "title": "Why Is NVIDIA (NVDA) Up 16.4% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have added about 16.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NVIDIA due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nNVIDIA Beat Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates\n\nNVIDIA reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results and provided strong guidance for the first quarter.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings of $5.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13.4%. Moreover, the reported figure soared a whopping 486% year over year while increasing 28% sequentially. The robust increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher revenues and improvement in gross margin.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter revenues more than tripled on a year-over-year basis and climbed 22% sequentially to $22.1 billion. The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets following the normalization of channel inventory. The top line also beat the consensus mark of $20.31 billion.\n\nSegment Details\n\nNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments — Graphics and Compute & Networking.\n\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\n\nGraphics accounted for 19% of fiscal fourth-quarter revenues. The segment’s top line soared 77% year over year while increasing 21% sequentially to $4.21 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Graphics segment was pegged at $4.19 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompute & Networking represented 81% of fiscal fourth-quarter revenues. The segment comprises Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.\n\nCompute & Networking revenues soared 387% year over year and 22% sequentially to $17.9 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this segment was pegged at $15.88 billion.\n\nMarket Platform’s Top Line Details\n\nBased on the market platform, Gaming revenues increased 56% year over year and were flat sequentially at $2.87 billion, accounting for 13% of the total revenues. The year-over-year surge reflects increased sales to channel partners following the normalization of inventory and increased sales of its GeForce RTX 40 SUPER series family of GPUs (graphics processing units). Our estimate for the Gaming end-market’s fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $2.83 billion.\n\nRevenues from Data Center (83.3% of revenues) jumped 409% year over year and 27% from the previous quarter to $18.4 billion. This robust rise was mainly driven by higher shipments of the Hopper GPU computing platform used for the training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, along with InfiniBand end-to-end solutions.\n\nNVIDIA witnessed strong demand for its chips used in datacenter by enterprise software and consumer Internet applications, and multiple industry verticals, including automotive, financial services and healthcare. During the fiscal fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of Data Center revenues. Additionally, Data Center sales to China declined significantly in the quarter due to the U.S. government licensing requirements.\n\nThe segment also experienced traction from its Cloud Service Provider (CSP) customer base both in Hyperscale and GPU-specialized CSPs globally. Our estimate for this end-market’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $16.43 billion.\n\nProfessional Visualization revenues (2.1% of revenues) increased 105% year over year and 11% sequentially to $416 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher sell-in to partners following inventory normalization while the sequential increase was driven by the ramp of desktop workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture. Our estimate for the Professional Visualization end-market’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $433.3 million.\n\nAutomotive sales (1.3% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $281 million, down 4% on a year-over-year basis but up 8% sequentially. The sequential rise was mainly driven by self-driving platforms.  Our estimate for this end-market’s fiscal fourth-quarter revenues was pegged at $294.5 million.\n\nOEM and Other revenues (0.3% of revenues) were up 7% year over year and 23% sequentially to $90 million. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this end market was pegged at $84.8 million.\n\nOperating Details\n\nNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin increased to 76.7% from 66.1% in the year-ago quarter and 75% from the previous quarter, mainly driven by higher Data Center sales and benefits from favorable component costs.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 25% year over year and 9% sequentially to $2.21 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits. However, as a percentage of total revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 10% from 29.3% in the year-ago quarter and 11.2% in the previous quarter.\n\nThe non-GAAP operating income jumped 563% year over year and 28% sequentially to $14.75 billion, primarily driven by higher revenues, along with an improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nAs of Jan 28, 2024, NVDA’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $25.98 billion, up from $18.28 billion as of Oct 29, 2023. As of Jan 28, 2024, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, almost flat with $8.45 billion at the end of the third quarter.\n\nNVIDIA generated $11.5 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter’s $2.25 billion and the previous quarter’s $7.33 billion. In fiscal 2024, it generated an operating cash flow of $28.09 billion, up from $5.64 billion in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company ended the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 with free cash flow of $11.22 billion and $26.95 billion, respectively.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, the company returned $99 million to shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $2.8 billion. In fiscal 2024, the company paid out $395 million in dividends and bought back stocks worth $9.5 billion.\n\nIn the quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of approximately $22.44 billion, which has no expiration time.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $24 billion (+/-2%). The GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are projected at 73.6% and 77%, respectively (+/-50 bps). GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n\nGAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, are anticipated to be an income of approximately $250 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is estimated at 17% (+/- 1%).\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 16.49% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, NVIDIA has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Tech stocks are known more for their significant long-term growth than for their dividends. However, investing in a tech company with a reliable dividend can be an excellent way to expand your portfolio, benefiting from a high-growth industry and potential dividend reinvestment.\n\nFive of the six most valuable companies in the world are tech firms. The industry generates massive amounts of cash, allowing some larger firms to reward investors with more than just stock growth.\n\nWhile these companies' dividend yields might not compare to some non-tech stocks, they are worth considering along with their stellar share-price appreciation. So here are three dividend-paying tech stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business exploded last year as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the go-to for AI developers worldwide. The company became the first chipmaker to hit a market cap above $1 trillion, with its stock rising 249% in the last year.\n\nThe company paid its first dividend in 2013 and increased it every year until November 2018. Its dividend remained at $0.16 until May 2021. A 4-for-1 stock split the same year brought its quarterly dividend proportionally down to $0.04 per share for a 0.02% yield, where it currently stands.\n\nHowever, it remains an attractive dividend-paying tech stock. When companies like Amazon and Alphabet have no dividends, Nvidia's impressive stock growth, alongside even a small dividend, makes its stock worth buying.\n\nNvidia's quarterly revenue climbed 207% over the last year, while operating income has soared 536%. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that will likely see it raise its dividend in the coming years. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nMoreover, this chart shows that Nvidia's earnings could hit nearly $36 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 36 yields a stock price of $1,294, projecting stock growth of 44% over the next two fiscal years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with a reliable dividend, Nvidia's stock looks like a no-brainer investment right now.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is easily one of the most reliable options in tech, having increased its dividend payout for 19 consecutive years. The company raised its cash amount to $0.75 in 2023, which translates to an annual payout of $3 per share (three times what it was 11 years ago).\n\nConsistent dividend growth reflects Microsoft's solid business model. Potent products like Windows, Office, Azure, and Xbox made the company a tech behemoth.\n\nThe success of these products has seen Microsoft's annual revenue rise 144% over the last decade, with operating income up 217%. Meanwhile, free cash flow has soared 150%, hitting over $67 billion last year.\n\nAlong with solid financials, there are plenty of reasons to believe Microsoft will continue increasing its dividend. It pays out only about 25% of its earnings in dividends, indicating it could keep growing its dividend even if headwinds arise.\n\nMoreover, the company is investing heavily in some of the fastest-growing sectors, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's lucrative positions in these markets will likely see its earnings continue to soar over the long term.\n\nA forward P/E ratio of 36 makes its stock somewhat expensive. However, a dominating role in tech and consistent dividend growth means its stock has likely earned its high valuation and is worth considering right now.\n\n3. Apple\n\nRather than focusing exclusively on high yields, one of the best ways to find dividend stocks is to seek out companies with significant cash resources, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). A focus on high yields could lead you to an investment in a financially struggling business; meanwhile, a cash cow like Apple can almost guarantee dividend growth over the long term.\n\nIn the last decade, its dividend yield has increased 104%. It rose to $0.24 per quarter in 2023, with a yield of 0.5%. Apple has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years, with its payout requiring only about 15% of its earnings.\n\nApple's yield might not be as impressive as popular dividend stocks like Verizon or Coca-Cola, but sticking with its current dividend growth trajectory could see the payouts double again over the next 10 years. With a stock that has risen 840% since 2014, the company could be one of the smartest long-term investments.\n\nAnd it's hard to argue with Apple's powerful position in tech. The company hit nearly $107 billion in free cash flow last year thanks to the immense popularity of products like the iPhone, MacBook, and iPad, as well as its many digital services.\n\nThe company's forward P/E of 27 makes it slightly cheaper than Microsoft but still pricey. However, a reliable dividend and expansions into lucrative markets like AI and virtual reality make its stock a solid buy this March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, eBay Inc. EBAY and American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Solid Stocks to Buy as S&P 500 Hits New Record High\n\nWall Street has been on a rally this year, with major indexes hitting all-time highs in the past couple of months. The S&P 500, particularly, is on a dream run, with the index hitting multiple record highs in the past month.\n\nOn Mar 20, the S&P 500 achieved a record high after closing above the 5,200 level for the first time. The index finished at 5,224.62 on Wednesday. Year to date, the index has advanced 9.5%.\n\nThe fresh high came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said that it expects three rate cuts before the end of 2024. Higher interest rates have been hurting consumers over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in July 2023 and kept rates unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking it by 525 basis points.\n\nInflation has cooled in the past several months. Optimism surrounding the end of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign and multiple rate cuts this year has been driving the rally.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also on solid ground, with the GDP growing 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally over the past year has been driven by tech stocks, primarily because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. AI-centered stocks rallied last year and the momentum continues into this year, with a large number of companies trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., eBay Inc. and American Water Works Company, Inc. that have a strong potential in 2024.

        "content": "Not all semiconductor stocks are equal. While there are some real dogs out there, the market has also blessed us with some outstanding semiconductor stocks to buy that are absolute superstars for any portfolio.\n\nGranted, some semiconductor stocks are depressed because of headwinds facing electric vehicles, smartphones and the solar power industry. But equally powerful factors are making the semiconductor stocks on this list a bullish play.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence and machine learning are massive factors spurring some semiconductor stocks to record highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs more companies work on creating features and platforms that take advantage of this trend, semiconductor stocks that can capitalize on that growth will continue to perform well.\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to identify some of the best semiconductor stocks to buy. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on various factors, including momentum, growth, earnings performance and analyst sentiment.\n\nWhen you see stocks with “A” and “B” ratings, you know you’re looking at a true superstar in today’s market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere can be no question that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) deserves the top spot on any list of semiconductor stocks to buy. The chipmaker has been the most notable semiconductor stock in the last year as it jumped 239% in 2023 on massive earnings growth.\n\nNvidia makes the lion’s share of high-powered semiconductors that are mostly responsible for generative AI applications. That growth has seen Nvidia’s market capitalization jump to $2.2 trillion, making it the third-biggest company in the world by market capitalization.\n\nI’m confident that the demand for processors used to train large language models will continue to grow, as well demand for chips for other AI use cases. I won’t be surprised to see NVDA stock hit $1,000 per share soon.\n\nNVDA stock is up 82% so far in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Nvidia made a killing in 2023, its primary competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) had a less successful year. While its gain of 129% was strong and outperformed the market, it paled compared to Nvidia, which dominated the headlines.\n\nBut 2024 is shaping up to be a better year. AMD is finally rolling out its MI300 semiconductors that can compete with Nvidia’s AI offerings. AMD is projecting to bring in $3.5 billion this year from the MI300.\n\nOn top of that, AMD has a 90% market share for AI chips for personal computers. And while that is a relatively small segment in the overall AI space, I don’t believe that the upset from AI infrastructure chips is fairly represented in AMD’s current stock price.\n\nAMD stock is up 21% so far this year, despite a recent pullback that makes the stock a relative bargain. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is also a semiconductor manufacturer. Its products are used in data centers, networking, software, storage, wireless, and industrial applications.\n\nThe company supplies Ethernet switching and routing silicon products, network adapters, controllers, and transceivers.\n\nIt’s also expanding its reach into the software market thanks to its recent acquisition of VMware, whose hybrid cloud platform should complement Broadcom’s strengths.\n\nThe VMware Cloud Foundation platform gives large corporate customers the power of a cloud network even with on-premise data centers. And it uses Nvidia graphics processing units to allow customers to run AI models on site for added security.\n\nAVGO expects its software segment to generate as much as $20 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024–a huge jump from $7.6 billion in 2023.\n\nAVGO stock is up 14% so far in 2024, and 98% in the last 12 months. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the globe’s largest chip manufacturer.\n\nThe foundry is responsible for roughly 55% of all contract chip manufacturing and 90% of the most advanced chips.\n\nConsidering that Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and others rely on it to make their chips, it’s only natural to include TSMC on any list of superstar semiconductor chips to buy. And the company’s recent performance backs up the bullish call.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $19.6 billion, with earnings of 29 cents per share. The company is projecting revenue in the first quarter of this year to be somewhere between $18 billion and $18.8 billion with strong demand for high-performance computing chips and lesser demand for smartphone chips.\n\nTSM stock is up 31% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor photomasks – the opaque plate with transparent areas that allow light to shine through in a specific pattern to power semiconductors.\n\nThe company’s photomask products and services include advanced integrated circuit technology nodes, binary masks, phase-shift masks and special purpose products. Without quality photomasks, semiconductors simply wouldn’t function.\n\nThe company says the global market for semiconductor photomasks is roughly $4 billion. That makes companies like Photronics an appealing option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios while still getting involved in the semiconductor space.\n\nThe Connecticut company’s revenue was $216.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $211 million a year ago. Income was $26.2 million, up from $14 million a year ago, and earnings rose from 23 cents per share last year to 42 cents per share in this quarter.\n\nPLAB stock is up 67% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor manufacturer that designs and manufactures products for carrier, enterprise, data center and automotive platforms.\n\nIts chips can be used in cloud applications or on-site. It’s also one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nMarvel’s products are designed to help transmit data quickly so AI can function and make decisions. Marvel’s chips are used in routers, ethernet switches and digital signal processors.\n\nThe company is partnering with TSMC to create a platform to produce 2nm semiconductors optimized for accelerated infrastructure, which is critical to developing AI applications. Marvell says the platform is the industry’s first for 2nm semiconductors for accelerated infrastructure.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Feb. 3, 2024) included revenue of $1.42 billion, up from $1.41 billion a year ago.\n\nMRVL stock is up 66% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) makes equipment and provides the services and software needed to manufacture semiconductor chips that are used for computers, smartphones, televisions and solar products.\n\nHowever, the company is seeing strong sales for its AI chips, which is supporting its performance even as other markets soften.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.7 billion, the same as a year ago. But net income improved to $2.01 billion from $1.71 billion, and earnings per share improved to $2.41 from $2.02 per share.\n\nIf the personal computer and smartphone markets improve, as I believe they will later this year as people look to replace devices bought during the Covid-19 pandemic, then AMAT’s future looks even brighter.\n\nAMAT stock is up 61% in the last 12 months, and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier and InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had long positions in NVDA.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Is Selling Alphabet and Nvidia Hand Over Fist, but Is Buying These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire David Tepper likes artificial intelligence (AI) stocks -- the bigger, the better. Pick a megacap AI stock, and there's a pretty good chance that it's in the portfolio of his hedge fund, Appaloosa Management.\n\nTepper isn't as big of a fan of some of these stocks as he is of others, though. The successful hedge fund manager has been selling shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) hand over fist, but he has been buying two other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nNot so magnificent in Tepper's view\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper slashed Appaloosa's stake in Nvidia by nearly 23%. While the GPU maker still ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest holding, Tepper clearly isn't as bullish about it as he once was.\n\nWhy would the billionaire sell such a big chunk of his position in Nvidia? The most likely answer is its valuation. Nvidia's share price skyrocketed by nearly 240% last year. Tepper could have been concerned, as quite a few other investors were, that the stock's valuation was becoming frothy.\n\nAppaloosa also reduced its stake in Alphabet by more than 16%. Again, Tepper hasn't thrown in the towel on the tech giant. Alphabet remains the seventh-largest position in his hedge fund.\n\nValuation probably wasn't the overriding factor behind the decision to sell some of the stake in Alphabet. It's possible, though, that Tepper might have been concerned that Alphabet's revenue from Google Search could be threatened by the development of AI-powered virtual assistants.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks Tepper is buying\n\nSo which Magnificent Seven stocks is Tepper more enthusiastic about? He added to Appaloosa's stakes in two of them.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) already ranked as Appaloosa's third-biggest holding. In Q4, the hedge fund added another 200,000 shares, increasing its stake by more than 5%.\n\nIt's not hard to think of reasons why Tepper might have decided to invest more heavily in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. Its profitability has been improving significantly, and Tepper could expect this trend to continue in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also remains a fan of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The technology giant held the No. 2 spot in Appaloosa's portfolio going into Q4. During the quarter, Tepper bought an additional 65,000 shares of Microsoft -- enough to boost the hedge fund's stake by nearly 4%.\n\nMicrosoft continues to fire on all cylinders. The company's integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model throughout its product lineup appears to be paying off handsomely. Customers are flocking to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and the AI tools that it offers. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard also puts it in a stronger position in the gaming market.\n\nSmart moves?\n\nWere these buy-and-sell transactions of Magnificent Seven stocks smart moves on Tepper's part? So far, the verdict is mixed.\n\nBoth stocks that Appaloosa sold have risen since the end of Q4. Nvidia has soared by nearly 80%, while Alphabet is up close to 6%. Adding to his fund's stakes in Amazon and Microsoft, though, has paid off: Each has jumped by a double-digit percentage thus far in 2024.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft eventually catch up with them. However, any sell-off of those stocks would likely only be temporary.\n\nMy view is that Tepper -- and other investors -- would be wise to scoop up more shares of all four of these Magnificent Seven stocks on pullbacks. I expect that AI will serve as a major long-term tailwind for each of them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 22, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA, Cadence Design Systems CDNS and ARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR ARM.\n\nA.I. Momentum: 3 Top-Ranked Stocks Breaking Out Now\n\nBroad markets are breaking out to new highs, and so are the leading Artificial Intelligence stocks. Although some investors may think of the providers of AI software like Microsoft or Alphabet, the real winners of this new trend are the semiconductor producers.\n\nOwning chipmakers means owning the infrastructure for this burgeoning industry – it’s called a pick and shovels approach and involves investing in the underlying technology rather than the end product.\n\nWhen following a new secular megatrend like Artificial Intelligence there is no need to overcomplicate the approach. Leaders lead and although it may feel hard to pay up for something that has already rallied considerably it will probably continue to be the most important stock in the industry.\n\nYes, I am talking about Nvidia, which is one of the stocks I will be sharing here, but there are two additional names that are less followed and are flying much lower on investors radar.\n\nCadence Design Systems\n\nWhile the spotlight often shines on the flashy AI companies developing the next big algorithms, a crucial element gets overlooked: the foundation upon which it's all built. Enter Cadence Design Systems. They're not creating the AI itself, but they're the architects behind the semiconductors that make it possible.\n\nCadence Design Systems is a multinational technology company specializing in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software. EDA software is a critical toolset used by engineers in the design and verification of integrated circuits (ICs), often referred to as microchips. These ICs are the fundamental building blocks of modern electronics, powering everything from smartphones and laptops to complex medical devices and data centers. By providing the software that facilitates IC design, Cadence plays a crucial role in the development of the technology that underpins our digital world.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, although AI is a fantastic new catalyst for Cadence’s business, they have been extremely successful already up until this point. The stock has steadily climbed higher, reflected by powerful earnings and sales growth, more than 20xing investors' money in the past 10 years.\n\nThe recent rally in the stock is also bolstered by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. In the chart below we can see FY24 and FY25 estimates curling higher.\n\nAnalysts have increased this year’s earnings and next year’s projections by 3% and 7.7% respectively in the last month. Over the next 3-5 years EPS are expected to climb by an impressive 17% annually.\n\nWith all these favorable developments it is no surprise that the stock has been strong. Just this morning Cadence Design Systems’ share price pushed to new all-time highs. Additionally, as we can see below it broke out from this compelling bull flag, showing considerable price momentum.\n\nNvidia\n\nWe all know by now the Nvidia story – it has been the stock to own over the last year and has appreciated an incredible 250% over that time reaching a $2 trillion market cap. While it is unlikely that Nvidia stock will maintain that blistering pace higher, it is in fact still the AI stock to own.\n\nNvidia produces the data centers and infrastructure which are critical to technology companies utilizing generative AI technology, and they are still way ahead of the competition in terms of computing power.\n\nNvidia also enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, which it has maintained for the better part of the last year, and contrary to its loudest critics still maintains a fairly reasonable valuation.\n\nAs of today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 37.9x, which is below its 10-year median of 41.8x. Additionally, its EPS are expected to climb at an annual rate of 30% over the next 3-5 years.\n\nThis explosion in valuation reflects what has been a parabolic move higher in sales at Nvidia.\n\nBelow, we can see that Nvidia stock just broke out from another convincing bull flag. Because some investors remain skeptical of these moves in Nvidia, utilizing these technical trading setups can aid in measuring risk and identifying when and where you may want to stop out and wait for another opportunity.\n\nARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR\n\nOne of the newer additions to the publicly traded semiconductor industry is ARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR.\n\nARM Holdings is a British semiconductor and software design company founded in 1990 and majority owned by Softbank. Known for its development of advanced microprocessor technology, ARM designs and licenses its intellectual property for use in smartphones, tablets, and embedded systems worldwide.\n\nIn addition to its dominance in mobile computing, ARM has also made significant strides in artificial intelligence development, optimizing its architecture for efficient execution of machine learning algorithms. These advancements position ARM as a key player in both the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, driving innovation across various industries.\n\nAlthough it is a new stock, analysts have already begun to raise earnings estimates, giving ARM Holdings a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Top of Form\n\nAnalysts have unanimously upgraded their forecasts for ARM, with current quarter earnings increasing by 43%, and next quarter by 20%.\n\nARM Holdings has enjoyed some nice momentum since its IPO and following its earnings report in early February exploded more than 100% higher. Since then, the stock has formed a massive bull flag, and just today broke out from the pattern.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEach of these stocks represents some of the best opportunities to get exposure to the AI theme, but also to own fantastic companies. The technical trading setups supported by the earnings revisions trend should help investors identify exciting investments, and carefully manage risk.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, SoundHound AI, or Nvidia: Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) craze has sent the share prices of many tech companies flying in 2024, but Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) stand out. Their astronomical gains managed to eclipse even AI chip pioneer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has been growing at a fast pace thanks to the buoyant demand for its graphics cards.\n\nWhile shares of Nvidia have gained an impressive 75% so far in 2024, Super Micro Computer has shot 209% higher, and SoundHound AI is up by 268%. But are any of these three AI stocks still worth buying at their current valuations?\n\nAll three companies seem set for solid growth\n\nDespite Supermicro's impressive year-to-date rise, the stock still trades at an attractive 6.6 times sales. That's not surprising, as the company justified its rapid stock price surge with solid revenue growth. For instance, in its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended on Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue more than doubled to $3.66 billion from $1.8 billion in the prior-year period.\n\nAdditionally, Supermicro raised its fiscal-year guidance to a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion. At any point in that range, the company would more than double its fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion. This terrific growth can be attributed to the massive demand for Supermicro's AI server solutions, which are used for mounting chips from Nvidia and others.\n\nAccording to a forecast from Research and Markets, the AI server market will generate $24 billion in revenue in 2024. Based on Supermicro's revenue forecast for its current fiscal year, the company controls about 60% of this market. More importantly, the AI server market is expected to clock annualized growth of 25% through 2029 and generate annual revenue of $72 billion. So Supermicro seems capable of sustaining its outstanding growth pace over the long run, especially considering that it is focused on boosting its manufacturing capacity to meet to the rising demand for AI servers.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are predicting that Supermicro will deliver outstanding growth in the current fiscal year and beyond. SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMeanwhile, SoundHound AI benefits from the growing demand for voice-enabled AI solutions. Its revenue jumped 47% in 2023 to $46 million. That was the same growth rate it recorded in 2022, and management forecast that its growth would accelerate in 2024 and 2025. The midpoint of its 2024 revenue guidance stands at $70 million, which would be a 52% increase.\n\nEven better, SoundHound \"expects its growth to accelerate with revenue exceeding $100 million\" in 2025. That won't be surprising considering the company's revenue pipeline. SoundHound says that it has a cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog worth an impressive $661 million, a figure that doubled on a year-over-year basis in the previous quarter.\n\nWhen SoundHound speaks of \"bookings,\" it's referring to \"committed customer contracts,\" while the subscriptions backlog is indicative of the potential revenue it could generate from its existing customers. Its huge backlog shows why SoundHound is slated to deliver solid growth in 2024 and 2025. SOUN Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nFinally, there's Nvidia. It is easy to understand why its shares have rocketed nearly 500% higher since the beginning of 2023 when the AI craze started gripping the stock market. The company is a pick-and-shovel AI play, as its graphics cards have been the foundation upon which AI models are being trained. ChatGPT, for instance, was trained using a huge number of Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units). Subsequently, all the major cloud computing providers started queuing up to buy Nvidia's chips to power the development and rollout of AI applications.\n\nAs a result, it started ramping up the production of its flagship H100 processors, bringing down their waiting period from almost a year to three to four months. Even then, Nvidia management says that the demand for its GPUs will continue to exceed supply. That's not surprising considering Nvidia's monopoly-like position in the AI GPU market, which it is looking to strengthen further with the launch of its new Blackwell processors later this year. Nvidia predicts that these new processors will help it gain a bigger share of the $250 billion AI chip market. What's more, the company's foray into additional AI chip niches such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) could help it unlock new growth opportunities.\n\nAs such, Nvidia seems capable of growing at a healthy pace for a long time. In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended Jan. 28), its revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion. Its non-GAAP earnings surged by 486% to $5.16 per share. Nvidia anticipates its revenue will jump 233% year over year in its fiscal 2025 first quarter to $24 billion. More importantly, it enjoys fat margins in the AI GPU market, which explains why its earnings are forecast to nearly double in the current fiscal year from last year's reading of $12.96 per share. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSo, the bottom line is that all three AI stocks discussed here seem primed for outstanding growth.\n\nBut which ones should you buy?\n\nAll three companies now trade at expensive valuations. While Nvidia sports a trailing earnings multiple of 73, Supermicro is trading at 83 times earnings. SoundHound isn't profitable yet, but its price-to-sales ratio of 44 is much higher than Supermicro's ratio. Nvidia, for comparison, trades at 36 times sales. Also, Nvidia is growing faster than the other two, and its forward sales multiple is lower than SoundHound's. NVDA PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia is cheaper than Supermicro based on the forward earnings multiple metric. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nSo, we can conclude that SoundHound AI has become too expensive to buy right now. Supermicro, while cheap in terms of its sales multiple, is facing margin challenges. Its non-GAAP gross margin fell to 15.5% in the previous quarter from 18.8% in the prior-year period. Nvidia's adjusted gross margin, on the other hand, jumped 14.6 percentage points last quarter to 73.8%.\n\nThis tells us why Nvidia is cheaper when it comes to the forward P/E ratio. So investors looking to buy one of these three AI stocks would do well to buy Nvidia, considering its immense earnings power and dominant position in the AI chip market. Supermicro would also make a nice addition to their portfolios, considering its potential earnings growth, its ability to capitalize on the AI server market, and a cheap sales multiple.\n\nInvestors, however, would do well to stay away from SoundHound for now, as it is too expensive and has yet to become profitable. However, it would be a good idea to keep the stock on your watch list, considering the end-market opportunity it is sitting on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Every investment contains an element of risk. Yet although there aren't any sure things in the stock market, the following businesses offer their shareholders a high probability of success in the coming years.\n\nWalmart\n\nPeople like bargains. That's particularly true today, as consumers battle stubbornly high inflation. Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) low prices are attracting increasingly cost-conscious shoppers during these challenging economic times -- and the discount retailer's profits are swelling.\n\nThe retail giant's massive scale -- Walmart's more than 10,500 stores generated a whopping $648 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months -- enables it to negotiate the best deals with suppliers. The company's large selection of value-priced groceries and other household essentials entices customers to return often to its stores.\n\nMoreover, Walmart's profits are likely to grow faster than its sales. Smart investments in automation technology are making its sprawling fulfillment network more efficient. During a conference call with analysts, CFO John Rainey said the company's cost of fulfillment improved by 20% over the last year. New investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and drone delivery technology should lead to further profitability gains.\n\nWalmart has another powerful profit driver in its booming advertising business. In February, it struck a deal to acquire smart-TV maker Vizio for $2.3 billion. Walmart intends to integrate Vizio's popular SmartCast operating system into its digital ad network. The deal is expected to boost the retail titan's data-collection and ad-targeting abilities. Walmart's high-margin ad sales are already growing rapidly, including a 28% jump to $3.4 billion in 2023.\n\nNvidia\n\nWe've entered the age of AI. The cutting-edge technology promises to bring enormous productivity gains to businesses of all sizes. Unsurprisingly, demand for the tools that enable AI is soaring.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese trends are a boon for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The semiconductor colossus designs the chips that power the most advanced AI models and applications.\n\nTech leaders like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla rely on Nvidia's chips to deliver their AI services. The chipmaker's sales and profits, in turn, are skyrocketing. Nvidia's revenue leaped 126% to $61 billion in its fiscal year ended Jan. 28. Its adjusted net income, meanwhile, soared 286% to $32 billion. These are astounding rates of growth for a $2.2 trillion business.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang expects sales of AI chips to remain strong in the coming years. Data center operators are projected to shift more of their spending to graphics processing units (GPUs) that excel at running AI workloads. To capture this demand, Nvidia unveiled a new line of powerful GPUs and AI chipsets during its eagerly awaited tech conference on March 18. The company's Blackwell processors are expected to provide a notable performance boost and significant cost savings compared to its enormously popular Hopper chips.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia debuted software designed to make it easier for its customers to run AI models across both cloud and on-premise data centers, as well as AI-enabled personal computers (PCs). These new software services could encourage companies to view the tech juggernaut more as a trusted AI platform rather than simply a hardware supplier and help to further differentiate Nvidia's AI offerings from the competition.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A surprise endorsement from Nvidia Corp. may have excited some investors over the prospects for Samsung Electronics Co. to catch up in the artificial intelligence race, but others remain unconvinced.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNY Gears Up to Seize Trump Westchester Assets If Fraud Fine Is Unpaid Baltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each Yemen’s Houthis Tell China, Russia Their Ships Won’t Be Targeted What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond Justice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as Thursday\n\nKey Samsung rival SK Hynix Inc. is already supplying Nvidia with the latest version of high-bandwidth memory, HBM3E. While Jensen Huang seems to have indicated that Nvidia will buy some HBM chips from Samsung as well, SK Hynix has gotten a big jumpstart by supplying previous generations of the technology.\n\n“It’s true that Samsung Electronics has become more attractive than in the past,” said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. “But it’s too early to buy it on expectations for its HBM business.”\n\nRead More: Samsung Jumps Most in Six Months After Nvidia CEO’s Backing\n\nThe AI theme has been more of a boon for SK Hynix so far, with its shares doubling over the past year, outpacing Samsung’s 30% gain. The difference lies in SK Hynix’s lead in HBM chips, which work alongside processors crucial for the training of large language models. Samsung is more exposed to the cyclical demand and pricing of commoditized traditional memory, given its market share in consumer devices.\n\nThat’s why it was a surprise when Huang reportedly said he plans to buy Samsung memory too. His comments have put shares of South Korea’s most valuable company on track for a 10% weekly gain, their biggest since 2015.\n\nOptions traders have been more ambivalent. Bets on both directions soared this week for Samsung, including puts wagering on a 70% drop in the next three months and calls that will cash in if the stock surges 300% in the same time span.\n\nStory continues\n\nDay traders took a contrarian stance on the Huang boost. While institutional investors poured cash into Samsung shares Wednesday and Thursday, retail traders sold 3 trillion won ($2.3 billion) worth of the stock on a net basis, a record two-day withdrawal.\n\n“Majority opinion is still that Samsung won’t be getting the call on HBM3E from Nvidia,” said Cha So-yoon, a fund manager and equity team head at BNK Asset Management Co. “If there is a turnaround in tech sentiment, it will be great for both companies but SK Hynix doesn’t appear to be losing its HBM hegemony.”\n\n--With assistance from Jeanny Yu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds Magnificent Seven?

        "content": "Investor interest in generative AI has been unmatched recently. And companies that engage in innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) technology and other cloud-based services have exploded.\n\nThe stock market is already in a bullish environment due to the increased potential that the Federal Reserve will begin to start cutting interest rates later this year, following a reduction in overall inflation.\n\nIn addition, the tech industry, most notably companies that play a major role in AI innovation, has sent the market to even greater heights.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are a few companies on the cutting edge of AI technology that have seen impressive share price appreciation and growing investor enthusiasm, which makes them strong investment options.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) offers cloud-based services that give a more detailed view of a company’s customer base and other strong metrics such as forecast sales growth, sales data and improved workflow options through a number of applications.\n\nSimilar to other stocks, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Salesforce recently announced an initial quarterly dividend of forty cents per share, which is a sign that CRM is in a strong financial position.\n\nIts share price has increased by over 60% in the last year following earnings results that have beaten analyst expectations and the rollout of new products such as the Einstein Copilot, which helps streamline business communication using AI technology.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Salesforce reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, in which it stated that total revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. Share buybacks totaled $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, and it reported the authorization of another $10 billion in repurchases.\n\nSalesforce is a giant within the expanding generative AI and cloud computing industries. It continues to offer investors strong and consistent growth potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a company that focuses on automation for digital businesses. It uses a wide variety of tools, such as robotic automation, artificial intelligence and cloud services, to assist with improved workflow productivity.\n\nIt reported earnings on Jan. 24 for the fourth quarter full year 2023, in which it stated that subscriber revenue increased by 27% and net income nearly doubled compared to the year before.\n\nOn Mar. 18, ServiceNow announced that it would acquire 4Industry — an application software company based in the Netherlands that is a partner of ServiceNow — and EY Smart Daily Management Application to improve its innovation capabilities.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has risen by more than 75% following strong earnings results and improved automation. It is a stock poised for future growth because it is a strong contender within the highly competitive industry and exhibits robust fundamentals.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor and processor manufacturer with products such as the AMD Ryzen, AMD Athlon, AMD Threadripper and AMD Radeon, which have been used particularly in data centers and gaming development.\n\nAMD, like other semiconductor companies, has seen increased growth this year due to the huge boom in AI and cloud based technology, leading to a greater need for chips used within data centers and other similar applications.\n\nOn Jan. 30, AMD released its earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, stating that total revenue increased by 10% year-over-year. Net income surged from $21 million in Q4 2022 to $667 million in Q4 2023. Most notably, its data center revenue grew by 38% within the previously mentioned time period. Other areas saw earnings improvement, such as the gaming and client segments, which saw a 17% and 62% increase, respectively.\n\nAMD’s share price has increased by over 85% within the last year. It is a solid option for investors who prefer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which also carries impressive growth potential.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "On Wednesday, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) topped estimates with its robust second fiscal quarter results. Upon the report, shares of the Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplier surged to a record high.\n\nSecond Quarter Of Fiscal 2024\n\nFor the quarter ended on February 29th, Micron reported revenue grew 58% to $5.82 billion, leaving Micron with a profit of $793 million, or 71 cents a share, improving from last year’s comparable quarter when it reported a loss of $2.31 billion, or $2.12 a share.\n\nOn Wednesday, Micron revealed its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) ultrafast semiconductors used for AI development were sold out for 2024 while the majority of its 2025 supply has also been allocated. Chief business officer, Sumit Sadana, also revealed that Micron signed up new customers for its HBM products that it was yet to announce.\n\nThird Fiscal Quarter Guidance Also Topped Estimates\n\nMicron guided for revenue in the range between $6.4 and $6.8 billion and earnings per share between $0.38 and $0.52.\n\nNvidia is to use Micron’s chip in its next-generation H200 graphic processing units.\n\nMicron is one of the two suppliers of HBM chips to Nvidia along with SK Hynix, who also sold out its 2024 output. A month ago, Micron started mass producing its high-bandwidth memory chips for use in latest Nvidia-made semiconductors. Nvidia is expected to start shipping its latest semiconductors in the second quarter which should overtake the current H100 chip that has already triggered a massive surge in revenue. The demand for HBM chips for use in AI has fueled hopes that Micron would be able to weather a slow recovery in its other markets. HBM is also one of Micron's most profitable products, partly because of the technical complexity of its construction.\n\nMicron is well positioned to benefit from AI hype.\n\nMicron president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra highlighted the multi-year opportunity provided by AI in the semiconductor industry. Just for the fiscal 2024, Micron is on track to make revenue of several hundred million dollars from HBM chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Astera Labs surged more than 16% on its second day of trading on Thursday, as euphoria over artificial intelligence continued to power the stock, putting the chipmaker on course to add about $1.5 billion in market value.\n\nCompanies that make high-powered chips used in AI have been the biggest beneficiaries of a surge in demand as businesses race to adopt the technology.\n\nAstera shares rose to $72.15, after closing at $62.03 on the debut day — a 72% jump from its initial public offering price of $36.\n\n\"Investors' enthusiasm for the chip sector is intensifying, as they start to grasp the transformative potential of the AI revolution on earnings,\" said Brandon Michael, analyst at investment management firm ABC Funds.\n\nThe Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index rose 3.1%, adding to its gains of more than 18% so far this year. The index, which includes Astera's competitors and top chipmakers such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology, had risen more than 64% in 2023.\n\nAstera, which sells high-speed data transfer technology for AI computing and other data center applications, is currently not part of the index.\n\nThe company, along with some of its existing investors, raised $712.8 million by selling 19.8 million shares at $36 each in its upsized IPO.\n\n\"The equity valuation multiple such as enterprise value-to-sales is excessive for Astera Labs, and many times higher than Nvidia, reflecting the limited supply of pure plays on AI ... so the Astera Labs IPO taps into this demand,\" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\nMemory chipmaker Micron Technology also surged 16% to a record high, after its strong revenue forecast offered more evidence on AI's potential to drive demand for semiconductor firms.\n\nShares of Broadcom rose close to 8%, while Marvell and Nvidia were up between 1% and 4%.\n\nNvidia also makes InfiniBand, which works like an ethernet cable, linking clusters of chips across servers, and competes with networking offerings of Broadcom and Marvell.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)",

        "title": "AI Momentum: 3 Top Ranked Stocks Breaking Out Now",
        "content": "Broad markets are breaking out to new highs, and so are the leading Artificial Intelligence stocks. Although some investors may think of the providers of AI software like Microsoft MSFT or Alphabet GOOGL, the real winners of this new trend are the semiconductor producers.\n\nOwning chipmakers means owning the infrastructure for this burgeoning industry – it’s called a pick and shovels approach and involves investing in the underlying technology rather than the end product.\n\nWhen following a new secular megatrend like Artificial Intelligence there is no need to overcomplicate the approach. Leaders lead and although it may feel hard to pay up for something that has already rallied considerably it will probably continue to be the most important stock in the industry.\n\nYes, I am talking about Nvidia NVDA, which is one of the stocks I will be sharing here, but there are two additional names that are less followed and are flying much lower on investors radar.\n\nCadence Design Systems\n\nWhile the spotlight often shines on the flashy AI companies developing the next big algorithms, a crucial element gets overlooked: the foundation upon which it's all built. Enter Cadence Design Systems CDNS. They're not creating the AI itself, but they're the architects behind the semiconductors that make it possible.\n\nCadence Design Systems is a multinational technology company specializing in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software. EDA software is a critical toolset used by engineers in the design and verification of integrated circuits (ICs), often referred to as microchips. These ICs are the fundamental building blocks of modern electronics, powering everything from smartphones and laptops to complex medical devices and data centers. By providing the software that facilitates IC design, Cadence plays a crucial role in the development of the technology that underpins our digital world.\n\nSo, although AI is a fantastic new catalyst for Cadence’s business, they have been extremely successful already up until this point. The stock has steadily climbed higher, reflected by powerful earnings and sales growth, more than 20xing investors money in the past 10 years.\n\nStory continues TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nThe recent rally in the stock is also bolstered by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. In the chart below we can see FY24 and FY25 estimates curling higher.\n\nAnalysts have increased this year’s earnings and next year’s projections by 3% and 7.7% respectively in the last month. Over the next 3-5 years EPS are expected to climb by an impressive 17% annually. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWith all these favorable developments it is no surprise that the stock has been strong. Just this morning Cadence Design Systems’ share price pushed to new all-time highs. Additionally, as we can see below it broke out from this compelling bull flag, showing considerable price momentum. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nNvidia\n\nWe all know by now the Nvidia story – it has been the stock to own over the last year and has appreciated an incredible 250% over that time reaching a $2 trillion market cap. While it is unlikely that Nvidia stock will maintain that blistering pace higher, it is in fact still the AI stock to own.\n\nNvidia produces the data centers and infrastructure which are critical to technology companies utilizing generative AI technology, and they are still way ahead of the competition in terms of computing power.\n\nNvidia also enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, which it has maintained for the better part of the last year, and contrary to its loudest critics still maintains a fairly reasonable valuation.\n\nAs of today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 37.9x, which is below its 10-year median of 41.8x. Additionally, its EPS are expected to climb at an annual rate of 30% over the next 3-5 years.\n\nThis explosion in valuation reflects what has been a parabolic move higher in sales at the Nvidia.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBelow, we can see that Nvidia stock just broke out from another convincing bull flag. Because some investors remain skeptical of these moves in Nvidia, utilizing these technical trading setups can aid in measuring risk and identifying when and where you may want to stop out and wait for another opportunity. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR\n\nOne of the newer additions to the publicly traded semiconductor industry is ARM Holdings PLC Sponsored ADR ARM.\n\nARM Holdings is a British semiconductor and software design company founded in 1990 and majority owned by Softbank. Known for its development of advanced microprocessor technology, ARM designs and licenses its intellectual property for use in smartphones, tablets, and embedded systems worldwide.\n\nIn addition to its dominance in mobile computing, ARM has also made significant strides in artificial intelligence development, optimizing its architecture for efficient execution of machine learning algorithms. These advancements position ARM as a key player in both the semiconductor and AI ecosystems, driving innovation across various industries.\n\nAlthough it is a new stock, analysts have already begun to raise earnings estimates, giving ARM Holdings a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Top of Form\n\nAnalysts have unanimously upgraded their forecasts for ARM, with current quarter earnings increasing by 43%, and next quarter by 20%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nARM Holdings has enjoyed some nice momentum since its IPO and following its earnings report in early February exploded more than 100% higher. Since then, the stock has formed a massive bull flag, and just today broke out from the pattern. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nEach of these stocks represents some of the best opportunities to get exposure to the AI theme, but also to own fantastic companies. The technical trading setups supported by the earnings revisions trend should help investors identify exciting investments, and carefully manage risk.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The shares are marching higher after the company raised its dividend payment to shareholders by 8%. EBAY also announced a new $2 billion stock repurchase program.\n\nMoving forward, eBay will pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 27 cents, up from 25 cents a share previously. The company now pays a healthy dividend that yields greater than 2%. The dividend hike and stock buyback program were announced alongside quarterly results that beat analysts’ estimates by a wide margin, helping to restore some confidence in EBAY stock. The company’s share price is now up 42% over five years.\n\nLowe’s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome improvement retailer Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) is also getting some love from Wall Street. Analysts at Mizuho Financial Group (NYSE:MFG) just initiated coverage of LOW stock with a “buy” rating and $280 price target, implying 13% upside from current levels. Mizuho also named Lowe’s a “Top Pick” for spring, saying the company should benefit from the upcoming gardening season.\n\nLOW stock is up 13% on the year, bringing its 12-month gain to 26%. The company’s stock has been trending upwards on the back of strong earnings. Recently, Lowe’s reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.77 compared to $1.68 that was expected for the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue totaled $18.60 billion versus $18.45 billion that was forecast by analysts. With the home improvement market picking up, LOW stock should benefit.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is generating buzz as an alternative AI chipmaker to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). On a recent earnings call, Broadcom’s management team stressed that they’re seeing strong demand for their microchips in AI data centres. Many on Wall Street also like that Broadcom’s semiconductors are also used in other sectors, such as broadband, server storage, and industrial applications.\n\nAVGO stock is up 14% this year and 93% over the last 12 months. While impressive, the gains in Broadcom’s stock pale in comparison to the 87% year-to-date increase and 248% 12-month rise in NVDA stock. Still, some analysts favor Broadcom’s stock, noting that it likely has more room to run and is less likely to be in bubble territory than Nvidia. Also, Broadcom’s chips are not all in the AI basket and the company is more diversified.\n\nToll Brothers (TOL) A photo of a man with a clipboard in front of a home under construction.\n\nSource: Shutterstock.com\n\nIf high interest rates are causing trouble in the housing market, someone forgot to tell Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL). The luxury home builder’s share price has gained 110% over the last 12 months, including a 20% increase this year. Despite the gains, TOL stock still looks inexpensive trading at nine times future earnings estimates. For a lot of people on Wall Street, Toll Brothers is seen as the best way to play the U.S. housing market right now.\n\nFor the final quarter of 2023, Toll Brothers produced financial results that exceeded Wall Street forecasts. The company reported EPS of $2.25 on revenue of $1.95 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.78 per share and $1.90 billion in revenue. Citing a strong start to the year, Toll Brothers raised its 2024 guidance, saying it now expects to deliver 10,000 to 10,500 homes, up from a previous estimate of 9,850 to 10,350 units.\n\nLyft (LYFT) the Lyft (LYFT) logo shown on a mobile phone.\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of ride-hailing and delivery company Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) are suddenly hot again and generating buzz. The company’s stock gained 24% on Valentine’s Day this year after management announced much better-than-expected financial results for Q4 2023. Notably, the company swung from a $416.5 million loss a year earlier to a profit of $222.4 million in the final months of last year.\n\nLYFT stock is now up 80% over the past 12 months and continues to exhibit strength. After struggling with a downturn coming out of the pandemic, Lyft has got its house in order again and is seeing an increase in bookings and sales. Lyft reported EPS of 16 cents, which was double the profit of the 8 cents expectation from Wall Street. Revenue in Q4 2023 totaled $1.22 billion, matching Wall Street expectations.\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) has become buzzworthy as a streaming stock that’s actually rising. While the stocks of companies focused on TV and movie streaming sink, audio streaming service Spotify’s share price is marching higher. In the last 12 months, SPOT stock has doubled, having increased 34% so far in 2024. Wall Street sees Spotify as the dominant player in the streaming of music and podcasts.\n\nIndeed, the Swedish company continues to demonstrate strong user growth. Monthly active users on Spotify’s platform grew 5% in the final quarter of 2023, reaching 602 million people worldwide. That surpassed analysts’ forecasts of 601 million global users. Importantly, the number of subscribers to Spotify’s more expensive premium service rose 4% in Q4 2023 to 236 million, also beating Wall Street estimates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Wall Street has been on a rally this year, with major indexes hitting all-time highs in the past couple of months. The S&P 500, particularly, is on a dream run, with the index hitting multiple record highs in the past month.\n\nOn Mar 20, the S&P 500 achieved a record high after closing above the 5,200 level for the first time. The index finished at 5,224.62 on Wednesday. Year to date, the index has advanced 9.5%.\n\nThe fresh high came after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and said that it expects three rate cuts before the end of 2024. Higher interest rates have been hurting consumers over the past year.\n\nThe Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes in July 2023 and kept rates unchanged in its current range of 5.25-5.5% after hiking it by 525 basis points.\n\nInflation has cooled in the past several months. Optimism surrounding the end of the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening campaign and multiple rate cuts this year has been driving the rally.\n\nThe U.S. economy is also on solid ground, with the GDP growing 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally over the past year has been driven by tech stocks, primarily because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. AI-centered stocks rallied last year and the momentum continues into this year, with a large number of companies trying to jump on the AI bandwagon.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "Fed Reaffirms Three Rate Cuts This Year: 5 Technology Picks",
        "content": "On Mar 20, after the FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark lending rate constant in the range of 5.25-5.5%. The range of the Fed fund rate has been steady since July 2023. Its current level marks the highest in 23 years. Since the beginning of 2024, market participants have been busy predicting when the central bank will cut interest rate first time.\n\nRecently, a large section of financial researchers and economists were worried about the rate cut as the inflation rate remains sticky supported by a resilient labor market, increasing wage rate and strong consumer spending. However, in a relief to investors, the Fed reiterated the number of interest rate cuts that it had indicated in the December FOMC meeting.\n\nFed’s latest “dot-plot” (a closely watched matrix of anonymous projections from the 19 officials who comprise the FOMC) shows the benchmark lending rate to come down to 4.625% at mid-point by the end of 2024. The existing mid-point of the Fed fund rate is 5.375%. This indicates three rate cuts of 25 basis points each.\n\nIn his post-FOMC statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said, “We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this type of cycle, and that if the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.”\n\nFollowing the March FOMC decision, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 75% probability that the first rate cut will come in the June FOMC meeting. This probability was 60% just before Powell’s post-FOMC statement.\n\nConsequently, Wall Street rallied to record highs. The broad-market index — the S&P 500 — closed at 5,224.62 after hitting an all-time high of 5,226.19. The benchmark closed above 5,200 for the first time. The blue-chip Dow recorded an all-time high of 39,529.13 and a closing high of 39,512.13. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a new closing high of 16,369.41.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth Sectors to Benefit\n\nDespite its higher valuation, the tech rally is likely to gather more pace in 2024 as a low market rate of interest always boosts growth stocks like technology. Investment in growth stocks creates wealth over a long period of time.\n\nA lower market interest rate will decrease the discount rate, which in turn will raise the net present value of investment. Moreover, many of these companies depend on the chip source of credit for the business to grow.\n\nThe ongoing tech rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\n\nWe believe the AI space is yet to unfold in the United States and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies producing high-end products.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five technology behemoths (market capital > $35 billion) that have provided double-digit returns year to date. These companies have robust business model, a solid financial position and globally acclaimed brand value.\n\nThese stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 30 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp.’s NVDA Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance NVDA’s presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 71% and 82.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the past seven days. The stock price of NVDA has soared 82.5% year to date.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid growth. Reels continue to do very well across Instagram and Facebook. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 34.1%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the past 30 days. The stock price of META has jumped 42.8% year to date.\n\nVeeva Systems Inc.’s VEEV continued focus on research and development and a strong product portfolio buoy optimism. VEEV has also been witnessing robust customer adoption of its products, which is encouraging.\n\nVEEV has inked a few strategic alliances over the past few months. A strong liquidity position is an added plus. We expect total revenues and adjusted earnings per share are likely to witness a CAGR of 12.8% and 11.7% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026, respectively.\n\nVeeva Systems has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.8% and 25.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.9% over the past 30 days. The stock price of VEEV has climbed 19.6% year to date.\n\nSynopsys Inc. SNPS is benefiting from solid design wins due to a robust product portfolio. Growth in the hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for SNPS’ Fusion Compiler product is boosting its top line. The growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects for SNPS. Moreover, the rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things and big data is driving investments in new computing and machine learning architectures.\n\nSynopsys has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.2% and 21.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the past 30 days. The stock price of SNPS has advanced 14.6% year to date.\n\nCadence Design Systems Inc.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Are Trading at Absurdly Highly Valuations",
        "content": "Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have generated great returns for investors over the past year. But along the way, that has resulted in some stocks reaching absurdly high valuations. In some cases, investors are paying massive premiums for future growth.\n\nHigh valuations may sometimes be warranted, but in some situations, the premium investors are paying may simply be far too high, putting them at risk for corrections down the road. Three of the most expensive AI stocks to own right now are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), and MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: MSTR). Are these shares worth their inflated valuations, or is it time to step away from these high-priced stocks?\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nChipmaker Nvidia has been symbolic of AI's meteoric rise in popularity over the past year. At more than $2 trillion, the stock's market cap has soared to new heights. And unsurprisingly, investors are paying a big premium for a piece of the business.\n\nAt 36 times the company's trailing revenue, this highly coveted AI stock doesn't come cheap. The bad news for value investors is that it may not get any more affordable as Nvidia has remained a hot buy this year, rising around 80% in value since the start of January.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, the company's revenue soared by 126% to just under $61 billion while posting profits of nearly half that -- $30 billion. If Nvidia can continue growing at such an incredible pace and keep up an impressive profit margin, it could still look like a cheap buy when bought for the long haul. In Nvidia's case, the AI stock could still be well worth its high valuation.\n\n2. SoundHound AI\n\nShares of SoundHound AI took off earlier this year after investors learned that Nvidia has invested in the AI business. SoundHound uses AI to enable conversational experiences, such as in drive-thrus to expedite and improve the ordering process for customers. There's significant potential there, but this is still a bit of an unproven business, with SoundHound reporting $46 million in revenue last year and its net loss nearly doubling that tally, totaling a negative $89 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound hasn't proven it can be profitable, and investors are taking a leap of faith with the business, largely, it appears, on the hopes that Nvidia is right and that it has found a promising AI business to invest in. At $2.5 billion, SoundHound's market cap isn't large, but given its relatively modest revenue, investors are paying a multiple of 45 times its trailing revenue.\n\nSoundHound does have the potential to be a good buy if its business proves it can be profitable while growing. But as of right now, that simply isn't the case, and the stock's multiple may be too rich to justify an investment. Unless you have a high risk tolerance, you may want to think twice about owning the stock.\n\n3. MicroStrategy\n\nThe third AI stock on this list is MicroStrategy, which uses AI in enterprise analytics to improve decision-making and give users more useful and actionable insights. It can help users with what-if scenarios and to learn more about their businesses and key drivers.\n\nMicroStrategy's fundamentals haven't been all that impressive, with the company reporting $496 million in revenue last year, which was flat from the previous year. And its operating loss totaled $115 million, as this is also a company that struggles with profitability.\n\nAt nearly 60 times its trailing revenue, this is one of the most highest priced AI stocks investors can buy. A big reason the stock has likely been a hot buy this year, rising 137% thus far, is due to the strength of Bitcoin.\n\nMicroStrategy has been acquiring bitcoin and has likely been winning over crypto investors along the way. But for long-term investors, there's nothing here to justify such a steep premium for MicroStrategy. This could turn out to be a risky stock to hold, given its expensive price tag.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer continues to focus on AI and the new investing opportunities it is creating. During his March 7 program on CNBC, Cramer wondered “how big is AI” and said the AI-led “technological revolution” is “crossing all barriers” and could potentially become the “heart” of the American national security apparatus. Jim Cramer said that AI could be key to making the “biggest amount of money” over the next five years.\n\nAI \"Bubble Busters\" Drive Jim Cramer \"Crazy\"\n\nJim Cramer yet again took a swing at AI naysayers who he called “bubble busters.” Cramer said these AI bears are “all around” him and it drives him “crazy.” After discussing Nvidia’s dominance in the AI industry and how the company is expected to remain at the top of the AI food chain because of its high performance chips, Jim Cramer started discussing stocks that would benefit from the AI revolution. Some of these companies would benefit from AI directly while others would see a huge demand for their products and services indirectly.\n\nCramer Picks Under-The-Radar AI Stocks\n\nJim Cramer also attended the recently-concluded Nvidia GTC conference and televised his program directly from there. Cramer said that there are many non-tech companies in partnership with Nvidia and keeping an eye on these companies could unlock huge opportunities for investors. Cramer believes these non-tech partners should “represent the best opportunities” since these companies usually stay under the radar.\n\nCramer often talks about mega-cap tech stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that will grow because of AI. But in this article we decided to take a look at some of the lesser known and under-the-radar stocks Jim Cramer believes would grow thanks to the AI revolution. Most of these are non-tech companies that would benefit from the AI wave directly or indirectly due to the AI ecosystem that is forming as companies begin to develop generative AI applications for hundreds and thousands of use cases.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 11 Stocks\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nJim Cramer is excited about Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) after the company revealed its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer recently admitted he hasn’t been a fan of Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) in the past because the company became public via a SPAC. Most of the SPAC IPOs, according to Cramer, were “garbage.” However, Cramer said it’s time to open the books on Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) since he believes Nvidia’s partnership could infuse a “life” in the stock.\n\nIn addition to GETY, Cramer also recommends NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nDuring the company's Q4 earnings call Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)'s management talked about partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"In partnership with NVIDIA, we announced and launched a truly unique generative image offering, an offering that is trained on licensed and released data and rewards content creators for the training, and offering that respects third-party intellectual property rights and a social and responsible and that it cannot produce deepfakes, an offering that is commercially safe and indemnified, an offering that produces high-quality outlets.\n\nWe launched Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) and VA-API in Q4, a nice stock in January of this year. Of course, with all things AI, the pace of innovation is break-neck. In recent weeks, we have already introduced expanded controls and capabilities such as in-panning and out-panning. We’ll be releasing a newly trained model soon and we will also enable AI capabilities across our entire pre-shop creative library. We also have big plans for video and partnership with NVIDIA and Runway, which we expect to launch later this year aligned to the commercial needs of our customers. While we continue to face macro challenges, as always we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers and long-term returns to our shareholders. At the core of Getty Images is high-quality content and coverage that is derived from top-notch talent, exclusive access, extensive research and rare expertise.\n\nWe pair this with world-class customer service across committed and long-standing relationships and the delivery of technology that truly enhances the creativity, productivity and efficiency of our customers without risks. With our solid foundation and clear vision and focus, we’re excited to return to growth in 2024.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nNextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) is among the list of companies that are set to benefit from the rising demand of clean energy amid the AI-based data centers wave. Cramer thinks companies deploying massive data center resources for generative AI applications would need to power their systems via cheap energy, which should also be clean. Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) provides solutions to enhance the efficiency of solar energy systems. That’s why Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) is poised to benefit in the coming days.\n\nLast month Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) posted strong quarterly results. J.P. Morgan increased its price target on the stock to $73 from $61.\n\nDuring its Q3 earnings call Nextracker Inc (NASDAQ:NXT) talked about data center-driven demand and opportunities:\n\n\"Over the last few years however, energy usage has increased dramatically driven by growth and data centers, electrification of appliances and transportation and reindustrialization across the United States. At the same time there has been a significant retirement of legacy power plants.\n\nThe combination of these factors has caused the U.S. Energy Information Administration to forecast a 5% annual increase need for new power generation capacity in the grid over the next five years. The result is that almost 300 gigawatts of new power plants are needed over the next five years and about 500 gigawatts of new power is needed over the next decade. Where is this massive amount of new power going will come from? The U.S. CIA historically very conservative on renewables is forecasting that solar and wind power will comprise the vast majority of new power generation. Solar is expected to have a 26% compound annual growth over the next five years and within 10 years be the number one source of electric generation in the United States comprising almost a quarter of all electric energy.\n\nNaysayers point to the intermittency of renewable power as an impediment to its large scale adoption in the grid. We believe this issue will improve. Sharp decreases in battery costs have enable steep ramping of battery storage, power plants in the grid both co-located with renewable power and standalone project.\"\n\nRead the full earnings all transcript here.\n\n8. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nJim Cramer, who has been bullish on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) for the past several months, thinks the huge rise of datacenters after the AI wave could further boost Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) since the company would play a key role in AI infrastructure building.\n\nIn January, Cramer grilled Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) bears, who, according to the analyst, were talking about “bogus” concerns about inventory slowdown problems for the company. Cramer, whose charitable trust owns a stake in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), said he held onto the stock and got rewarded. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) shares are up by about 58% over the past one year.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, also performed well this quarter. Caterpillar has managed to leverage increased capital investment from various end markets, contributing to better than expected fiscal results for Q2. The company is poised to be one of the largest beneficiaries of several government funding initiatives, including the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) bill, CHIPS Act and infrastructure bill. These measures are expected to support construction spending for several years, providing a robust backdrop for Caterpillar’s continued growth.”\n\n7. Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 41\n\nJim Cramer recently said that the rise of generative AI applications are creating huge demand for data centers, which in turn creates demand for power and energy management solutions. Cramer said AI data centers have to be connected to the grid that have low energy costs and “for many” this energy has to be clean. This is where companies like Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) come into play, according to Cramer. Cramer said that Constellation Energy Corp (NASDAQ:CEG) is helping major companies become carbon neutral as it provides clean energy.\n\n6. Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) because the company has a partnership with Nvidia. Cramer believes the new AI wave could revolutionize the medical diagnostics systems. In a latest program, Cramer said Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) could create a more effective endoscopy module to better detect colorectal cancer.\n\nIn addition to MDT, Cramer is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is the largest medical technology company in the world. Despite a few tough years characterized by post-COVID supply chain issues, Chinese market payment changes, and diabetes business challenges, the company has continued to invest aggressively in its R&D pipeline. Because of this long-term mindset and commitment to product innovation, the company is in a position today where it has numerous significant new product launches across the business, helping to accelerate growth and improve profitability. More recently, the market’s infatuation with the promise of GLP-1 drugs has resulted in valuation de-ratings across the medtech industry broadly, to which Medtronic was not immune. The combination of all of these factors has resulted in Medtronic shares trading at their lowest valuation in a decade. Given the emerging business momentum, we felt the valuation offers a compelling chance to increase our weight in the world’s largest medtech company.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Thinks AI Revolution Can Boost These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 9 Stocks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Are Making Traditional Industries Tremble",
        "content": "There are seven disruptive stocks that should be on every investor’s radar. These companies are pioneering innovative technologies and business models that have the potential to change traditional industries and create massive new markets.\n\nI feel that every investor should allocate at least some of their portfolio to these disruptive stocks. The reason being is that companies driving major technological and business model innovations have immense upside potential.\n\nOwning at least some of these shares could improve one’s risk-adjusted returns over the long-run, as well as balance out their portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt should be noted, however, that investing in these disruptive stocks assumes a significant amount of uncertainty. There’s no guarantee these stocks will continue to stay as winners in the long-run, but odds are on investors’ side that they could be.\n\nSo here are seven disruptive stocks for you to add to your portfolio in March this year. Don’t miss out.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) expanded into cryptocurrency, supporting transactions in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other digital currencies. It’s also one of those fintech disrupters that is changing up the industry.\n\nIn 2024, PayPal is eyeing a significant year, aiming to achieve a non-GAAP EPS of $6, marking a potential period of profitability. An analyst also has projected an $88.06 fair stock price for PayPal, suggesting a substantial upside based on fundamentals.\n\nWhat I like about PYPL is that it’s one of the few U.S. fintech companies expanding into China. It’s focusing on powering cross-border trades, and positions it uniquely in the vast Chinese market.\n\nThis, combined with its expected EPS expansion and a projected increase for its stock price, makes it one of those disruptive stocks that investors should pay attention to. One can’t go wrong with this outlook as well as its robust competitive moat that gives it an edge over its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Blockchain (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) specializes in cryptocurrency mining with significant investments in Bitcoin mining capacity and infrastructure.\n\nThe reason I chose RIOT as one of those disruptive stocks is due to the huge effort it has made to modernize and expand its cryptocurrency mining operations. I think that it’s word-class, and it has made plans to strengthen it.\n\nThe company has announced the purchase of 33,280 “next-generation” Bitcoin miners for its Texas facility at a cost of $162.9 million, which will add 7.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) to its self-mining capacity.\n\nThese new rigs are built specifically for immersion cooling systems and are expected to enhance fleet efficiency significantly.\n\nRIOT is also developing Phase 1 of its Corsicana Facility, which will add an additional 400 megawatts of capacity, with the goal of achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 29 EH/s by the end of 2024 and 38 EH/s upon full deployment in 2025​.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become a disrupter in artificial intelligence and computing through its GPUs, essential for gaming, AI applications, and more.\n\nI think that the best is yet to come for NVDA investors, which is almost totally due to it being one of those disruptive stocks.\n\nSome analysts agree with that sentiment. For instance, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo anticipates a 150% jump in NVDA’s AI graphics card shipments in 2024, thanks to the launch of two new AI GPUs and a big backlog of current graphics cards.\n\nA further analysis from Valuentum suggests that NVDA’s fair value estimate could grow significantly over the coming fiscal years.\n\nI also believe that with its predicted top and expansions that a share price appreciation is on the cards, this is despite it trading at 39 times forward earnings.\n\nNVDA’s position in the market as one of those disruptive stocks is perhaps self-evident from its 2 trillion dollar market cap at the time of writing and its multiple growth drivers of semiconductors, AI, blockchain, gaming, and more.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) upwork (UPWK) logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the largest freelance platform, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) counts among its benefits the growing gig economy and freelancing trend.\n\nBecause of its size and prominence in the market, the decision it makes spreads to other platforms as well, with alternative sites such as Freelancer taking note of its moves.\n\nFurthermore,Upwork has been proactive in enhancing its platform, launching new generative AI tools and services to centralize skilled AI talent and work.\n\nIt has also expanded its ecosystem to include gigs, similar to what made Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) so successful in the first place.\n\nI believe that AI one will day drop from our vernacular as a buzzword and instead become common parlance. UPWK is spearheading this revolution, and will continue to be an important conduit due to its centralization of AI tools and talent on its platform.\n\nAnalysts project continued revenue and earnings growth for Upwork, with estimates showing a gradual increase in revenue reaching $973 million by 2026, alongside significant earnings growth.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) has shown strong growth, especially in digital payments and cryptocurrency services​.\n\nIT’s one of the most successful fintech companies that have successfully embraced the cryptocurrency boom, along with its highly popular CashApp.\n\nI think SQ is one of those disruptive stocks because of this crypto integration, as well as its continued success as a fintech platform.\n\nSQ is committed to enhancing its platform via investments in AI to enhance its financial offerings, including fraud detection algorithms and insights into consumer behavior.\n\nLooking ahead, SQ has forecast a gross profit for FY2024 of at least $8.65 billion, which surpasses the consensus estimate of $8.55 billion. This guidance has contributed to a positive market reaction, with shares up just under 10% year-to-date.\n\nFor the upcoming earnings report, SQ is expected to report a significant increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter, with consensus estimates forecasting a jump of 168.2% from the year-ago period. Revenue is also expected to grow by 22% year-over-year.\n\nUpstart Holdings (UPST) Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. fintech company Upstart Network Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) uses AI to improve loan approval processes, identifying reliable borrowers often overlooked by traditional banks.\n\nIts business model itself makes it one of those disruptive stocks, but I feel that there’s more disruption in store for the market because of its expanding presence.\n\nLike with many companies intending to disrupt industries, UPST is facing headwinds as it navigates a highly complex environment.\n\nAt present, it’s attempting to reduce the loans on its balance sheet and guide toward improving revenues.\n\nFraming this is that the company reported better-than-expected sales in Q4 of FY2023, with revenue reaching $140.3 million against analyst estimates of $135.3 million.\n\nDespite these positive signs, Upstart’s guidance for Q1 2024 has raised some eyebrows. The company is expecting revenue of $125 million at the midpoint for Q1 2024, which is significantly below the analyst estimates of $151.3 million.\n\nUPST is a disruptive stock on a mission, and I feel these headwinds are short term rather than structural.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Affirm financial stocks to sell\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAffirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) is leading the Buy Now, Pay Later sector, offering flexible payment options for consumers.\n\nThe key of AFRM’s disruption in the BNPL space has been the growth of its direct-to-consumer business. It’s also seen the growth of the Affirm Card, which reached a Gross Merchandise Value of about $397 million, supported by over 700 thousand active consumers.\n\nIt has a consumer base of 17.6 million and 279,000 active merchants at the time of writing. The company anticipates GMV to exceed $25.25 billion in FY 2024, with an Adjusted Operating Margin of over 11%\n\nAlso the company’s adaptability to interest rate changes and its positive credit outcomes have positioned it well for sustained growth, as well as firmly positioned it in the market as one of those disruptive stocks for investors to own and enjoy.\n\nTrading at just 5 times sales, I think this pick also undervalued, and that the best is yet to come for this young company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Bought 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. These 2 Stand Out the Most.",
        "content": "Thanks to an incredible surge in its stock price over the last 12 months, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is now the third-most-valuable company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft, with a valuation of $2.2 trillion.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center are the go-to choice for developers building, training, and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. They drove a whopping 217% increase in the company's data center revenue during fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), and the momentum is expected to continue in fiscal 2025.\n\nWith all that extra cash coming in, Nvidia decided to spread some of its wealth at the end of last year by investing in five other AI companies. Do the buys point to where CEO Jensen Huang thinks the next wave of value will be created? Image source: Nvidia.\n\nThe five AI stocks Nvidia recently bought\n\nNvidia filed its first-ever 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, revealing it purchased five AI stocks in the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31):\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), which designs processors for the world's largest semiconductor companies. Nano-X Imaging, which develops AI applications to improve the field of medical imaging. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which is using AI to accelerate drug discovery. TuSimple Holdings, which develops autonomous driving technologies for the trucking industry. SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops conversational AI technologies.\n\nArm received the largest investment, with Nvidia's position worth $147 million at the end of 2023. That stake has grown to $254 million based on Arm's current stock price, following its 88% year-to-date gain in 2024.\n\nSoundHound AI received a small investment by comparison, with Nvidia's position worth just $3.7 million at the close of 2023. However, thanks to a whopping 296% gain in SoundHound stock in 2024 already, Nvidia's stake has already grown to $14.3 million.\n\nHere's why Arm Holdings and SoundHound AI stand out among the five stocks Nvidia is backing.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Arm Holdings\n\nNvidia tried to acquire Arm Holdings for $40 billion back in 2020, but the deal was abandoned because regulators feared it would hurt the competitive landscape in the semiconductor industry. Arm doesn't manufacture any chips itself, but rather it designs them on behalf of some of the world's largest companies, including Nvidia and Apple.\n\nRoughly 50% of all chips globally have an Arm-based architecture, and the company has an incredible 99% market share in the smartphone market specifically.\n\nNvidia is now shipping its latest H200 AI GPU for the data center, which is the successor to the industry-leading H100. However, it also offers the GH200, which pairs the GPU with an Arm-based processor. Two GH200s paired together can deliver three times more bandwidth than the H100, making it the ideal choice for accelerated AI development. The upcoming Jupiter supercomputer in Germany will use 24,000 of the GH200 chips, marking an incredible milestone in Arm's foray into AI and the data center.\n\nArm's investors might be glad the $40 billion deal with Nvidia fell through because the company is now valued at an impressive $133 billion. But before investors rush to buy the stock, I should point out that it's quite expensive.\n\nBased on the company's $2.9 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, Arm trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 45.5. That makes Arm stock even more expensive than Nvidia, which trades at a P/S ratio of 35.9. The disparity is even more concerning when factoring in Arm's expected revenue growth of 19.6% in the current fiscal year, compared to Nvidia's 80.1%.\n\nIn short, it's hard to justify paying a higher valuation for Arm stock compared to Nvidia. With that said, Arm will likely create substantial value for investors over the long term, but they might have to wait for a stock market correction to get a better entry point. If Arm stock experiences a decline of 30% or more from its current price, that might create an opportunity to buy in.\n\n2. SoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound AI is a small company relative to Arm, with a valuation of just $2.5 billion. But it's packed with potential thanks to its conversational AI technology, which is designed to recognize voice prompts and respond in kind.\n\nSoundHound serves some of the giants of the hospitality industry, where its AI automates drive-thru ordering, phone ordering, and in-store ordering. Its unique Employee Assist technology also stands ready to converse with staff members, answering their questions to speed up everything from customer service to in-store operations.\n\nJersey Mike's, White Castle, and Krispy Kreme are just some of the restaurant chains using SoundHound's technology. The company also has partnerships with Toast, Block's Square, and Olo, which serve as distribution channels for SoundHound's technology.\n\nSoundHound also has an automotive solution used by giants like Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis to create powerful virtual assistants for drivers. However, SoundHound just announced a new partnership with Nvidia's Drive platform, which will allow car manufacturers to deliver generative AI on the edge. That means drivers won't need network connectivity to use their voice assistant, broadening the number of use cases and improving important features like privacy.\n\nDrivers will be able to converse with their AI assistant to instantly access information about their car's features. It can also help them book restaurants and plan vacations, among a long list of other things.\n\nLike Arm, SoundHound stock is quite expensive following its significant run-up this year. The company generated $45.9 million in revenue during 2023, and while that was an impressive 47% year-over-year increase, it places SoundHound stock at a P/S ratio of 55.5. However, the company did have an enormous order backlog worth $661 million at the end of 2023, which doubled compared to where it was in 2022.\n\nThat implies SoundHound's revenue could scale up rather quickly from here, meaning investors who can hold the stock for the next few years might still do well despite its sky-high valuation. After all, the company does have Nvidia in its corner as both a partner and a shareholder.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Billionaires Are Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia and Buying These 10 AI Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For three decades, investors have been privy to no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Although nothing has been as transformative as the advent of the internet, innovations and trends that have included genome decoding, businesses-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is piquing the interest of investors quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With machine learning, software and systems have the ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at their task(s). It's what gives AI such broad-scale appeal in virtually every sector and industry. It's also what's made semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) the hottest thing since sliced bread. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the face of the AI movement\n\nAlthough Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been popular with the personal-computing gaming community for well over a decade, and its GPUs have gained traction with cryptocurrency miners during major crypto bull markets, it's high-compute data centers where the company's infrastructure has shone brightest.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of dominant in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup opined last year that Nvidia could control upwards of a 90% share of GPUs deployed by enterprises in high-compute data centers in 2024.\n\nWhat's really helped Nvidia is the scarcity of its top-notch GPUs. Since demand has swamped supply, it's been able to meaningfully increase the price of the GPUs it has available, which led to its sales more than doubling in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January).\n\nBut not everyone is on board with the Nvidia growth story. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective funds' stakes in this Wall Street darling. In particular, three billionaire money managers cut their funds' stake by more than 1 million shares, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management: 1,088,821 shares sold\n\nWhile some of this selling could be nothing more than benign profit-taking, Nvidia does have a growing list of headwinds to contend with this year. In addition to increasing external competition, the company is expected to contend with mounting internal AI-GPU competition from its top customers, the potential for margin cannibalization, and ongoing export restrictions to China.\n\nWhat's perhaps even more interesting is examining the collective 10 artificial intelligence stocks these three billionaires were buying as they were selling shares of Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander piled into the \"Magnificent Seven\" of AI stocks\n\nNo billionaire money manager dumped more shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter than Millennium's Israel Englander. While he and his team were busy paring down their stake in Wall Street's top-performing megacap stock, they were mashing the buy button for a trio of \"Magnificent Seven\" components, including:\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 2,446,316 Class A shares (GOOGL) purchased Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): 2,174,695 shares purchased Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 85,532 shares purchased\n\nThe \"why?\" behind these buys is simple: They're respective industry leaders. Alphabet's Google has accounted for more than 90% of global monthly internet search share dating back nearly nine years. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is far-and-away the world's leading online retail site, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the highest share of cloud infrastructure service spend. Lastly, Apple's iPhone controls more than half of the domestic smartphone market share.\n\nBut these Magnificent Seven components are also counting on AI to fuel their future growth. Alphabet and Amazon are some of Nvidia's top customers that are currently developing their own AI chips. Both companies are incorporating generative AI solutions into their respective cloud infrastructure service platforms to help businesses build applications and tailor their message(s) to consumers.\n\nApple is also developing AI infrastructure of its own, with the company's processors capable of running generative AI on MacBook. For the moment, Apple's AI ties are primarily its integration of solutions, such as predictive text on the iPhone.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Israel Englander sees considerably more upside in Nvidia's peers within the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBillionaire Jeff Yass added shares of time-tested AI businesses that would be AI-bubble resistant\n\nThe second-biggest billionaire seller of Nvidia stock during the fourth quarter was Susquehanna's Jeff Yass. While Yass and his investment aides slashed their funds' Nvidia stake by 27%, they were purchasing a trio of time-tested businesses with artificial intelligence ties that should be able to withstand a potential bursting of the AI bubble, including:\n\nAlibaba(NYSE: BABA): 5,297,854 shares purchased Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 527,008 shares purchased Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 115,276 shares purchased\n\nAs noted, the key point about these AI stocks is that if the AI bubble were to burst, their core operations would, presumably, prevent them from getting caught up in any major downdraft. For example, Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce platform, with Taobao and Tmall collectively accounting for a nearly 51% share of online retail sales. Alibaba Cloud is also No. 1 in market share in China (as of March 2023) and should continue to thrive given that enterprise cloud-service spending is still in its very early stages.\n\nTesla is North America's largest electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV maker that's been generating a recurring profit. Though it incorporates AI solutions into its self-driving technology, the company's success is ultimately determined by its ability to sell or lease EVs. If history were to repeat itself and the AI bubble were to burst, Tesla's operating results would ultimately dictate where its share price heads over the long run.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has its cash-cow legacy segments to fall back on, such as Windows and Office, as well as its high-growth initiatives, which include cloud infrastructure service platform Azure -- the worldwide No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider by spend, behind only AWS. Although Microsoft is betting big on AI, arguably more so than Alibaba or Tesla, it would likely be just fine if AI expectations are tempered at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBillionaire Steven Cohen gobbled up AI ancillary stocks in place of Nvidia\n\nThe final billionaire that was an aggressive seller of Nvidia stock during the December-ended quarter was Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management. While Cohen and his team were busy paring down Point72's stake in AI infrastructure kingpin Nvidia by 66%, they were buying four ancillary beneficiaries of the AI movement, including:\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL): 2,178,533 shares purchased Western Digital(NASDAQ: WDC): 971,494 shares purchased Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) 670,677 shares purchased Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG): 301,908 shares purchased\n\nSimilar to what Jeff Yass did at Susquehanna, Point72's investment team looks to be de-risking the fund by focusing on businesses that can benefit from AI but have less direct exposure if and when the bubble bursts. Whereas total sales for Oracle's recently reported quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) were up just 7%, infrastructure-as-a-service sales catapulted 49% from the prior-year period. While Oracle can easily lean on its legacy bread-and-butter segments if AI experiences a demand reset, it's well-positioned to be a long-term winner in AI infrastructure.\n\nWestern Digital is a potentially sneaky play on AI-driven storage. Just as Western Digital experienced a surge in demand during the initial wave of enterprise cloud-service spending, the growing storage demand needs in AI-accelerated data centers should be music to the ears of management. It could pave a path for the company's high-transfer-rate NAND flash memory solutions to become standard in data centers.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Dell Technologies has its core computing segments it can lean on if an AI bubble were to materialize. Nevertheless, it's witnessed exceptionally strong demand for customizable rack servers used by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Though this makes up a small percentage of Dell's business at the moment, it positions the company to sustainably benefit over the long run as AI solutions proliferate.\n\nCohen and his team also piled into robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical. This is a company that's utilizing AI to help surgeons study their own procedural data to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, the company should enjoy sustained double-digit sales growth as the da Vinci surgical system gobbles up share in a variety of soft-tissue surgical indications. No company comes remotely close to the installed base of assisted-surgical systems that Intuitive Surgical has put in place since this century began.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks",
        "content": "Investing doesn't always have to be about finding the next big thing. Sometimes, buying and holding what's already a great business is the better option in the technology space. Some companies dominate technology and have the size and deep pockets to protect their interests from competition.\n\nThese megacap tech stocks, known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, have turned individual investors into millionaires.\n\nCan that continue? Absolutely.\n\nHowever, not every Magnificent Seven stock is a table-pounding buy today.\n\nHere are the three that are:\n\n1. Nvidia: AI chip dominance spells a bright future\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The reason? It became the go-to AI chip company, enjoying a market share between 80% and 90% today. That's launched the stock upward by a blistering 500% since the start of 2023. Today, Nvidia's $2.1 trillion market cap makes it one of the largest corporations on the planet. So, how can the party keep going? Believe it or not, Nvidia still has millionaire-making potential over the long term.\n\nCompanies worldwide are implementing AI into their products and services. AI is certainly no fluke. The more AI spreads, the higher the demand for powerful data centers to power it. Nvidia's CEO believes there is a need for over a trillion dollars in additional data center spending over the coming years. CEO Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's chief rival, believes the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion.\n\nIf you annualized Nvidia's fourth-quarter data center revenue, the resulting $72 billion is a fraction of the potential market. Even if competition eats away at Nvidia's market share, it's hard to see a collapse. Suppose market share falls to 50%. Half of a $400 billion market is still three times Nvidia's annualized Q4 data center revenue. In other words, Nvidia's AI growth trend could continue for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nNumbers-wise, analysts believe Nvidia will grow earnings by an average of 30% annually over the next three to five years. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37 today, arguably cheap for a company with such high expected growth.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: The social media giant with room to run\n\nUnder Co-Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has become the king of social media. Today, nearly 4 billion people use any one of Meta's four apps: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp each month. A social media company doesn't jump out as an AI stock, but Meta is very much one. The company makes its money by advertising to its billions of users.\n\nAI is behind the scenes, choosing which content to show users to maximize their time and engagement on the app. It's helping advertisers craft compelling ads and finding the best users to show them to. Zuckerberg is also passionate about Reality Labs, an AI and metaverse business unit investing billions of dollars in research and development of augmented reality hardware and other technologies.\n\nMeta's user base grew by 6% in 2023, an impressive feat considering it grew from such a large base. This shows how good Meta Platforms is at social media, and it could grow even more potent if the United States takes action to ban TikTok because of owner ByteDance's ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Meta is a cash cow repurchasing shares and has just started paying investors dividends.\n\nMeanwhile, shares trade at a forward P/E of 24, an attractive price tag for a business that experts believe can grow earnings by 20% annually for the next three to five years. Shareholders are poised to enjoy billions of dollars raining down on them for dividends and repurchases, making Meta a potentially potent millionaire-maker.\n\n3. Alphabet: Don't count this stock out when it comes to AI\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has dominated internet search for two decades. The company maintains a roughly 90% share of global searches, making Google the world's most trafficked website. Second place? Video search platform YouTube, owned by ... you guessed it, Alphabet. The two sites create lucrative advertising opportunities, the golden goose that Alphabet has ridden to a trillion-dollar market cap.\n\nThere is some fear that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots could disrupt Google Search and cripple Alphabet's lucrative empire. However, don't rush to count Alphabet out. The company has launched AI tools of its own, and Google benefits from 20 years of brand power. Google is synonymous with internet search, and that won't be easy to change overnight.\n\nRemember that Alphabet is still one of the most influential companies on Earth. It generates $70 billion in free cash flow annually, more than most companies do in sales. It's not impossible, but breaching Alphabet's moat won't be easy.\n\nToday, shares trade at a forward P/E of 21, while analysts expect 16% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years.

        "title": "Isn’t Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock Overvalued? Not Quite",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks globally over the past 18 months. The chip manufacturer’s shares are up nearly 7x over the period. This extraordinary growth can certainly turn some investors off, making them believe it’s overvalued. However, it’s worth remembering that momentum can actually be one of the best indicators of forward stock performance, especially if the company has a track record of beating expectations.\n\nPersonally, I remain bullish on NVDA stock, not just because of momentum but because the company is so central to the AI revolution, which has only just begun.\n\nThe AI Kingpin\n\nNvidia, as a company, is at the very heart of the AI revolution due to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which possess the capabilities required for huge AI and large language models. The units were originally built for the gaming sector, but GPUs are also perfect for AI’s massive data processing needs.\n\nUnlike central processing units (CPUs) that handle tasks one by one, GPUs excel at parallel processing, allowing them to take on multiple tasks simultaneously. Without this technology, the step forward we’ve seen in AI, which includes developments in facial recognition technology and self-driving cars, wouldn’t be possible.\n\nNvidia’s dominance stems from the architecture of its GPU. Unlike CPUs with a few cores, Nvidia packs a massive number of cores onto a single chip. In turn, this allows for high processing power within a smaller space, and this is hugely important for efficient AI processing. Moreover, Nvidia has focused on high-bandwidth memory, which allows these cores to access data rapidly, further accelerating AI computations. As such, Nvidia has earned a significant edge in the AI hardware race.\n\nHowever, in the AI world, it’s not just about hardware. Nvidia’s CUDA software provides direct access to the GPU’s virtual instructions. This software ecosystem empowers developers to build and refine AI projects and has made Nvidia a one-stop shop for all things AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIsn’t Nvidia Really Expensive?\n\nNvidia stock is expensive in that it’s becoming less affordable for many investors. Trading around $900 a share, some investors may struggle to purchase a single Nvidia share as part of a diverse portfolio of holdings. However, from a valuation perspective, I don’t think Nvidia stock is expensive or overpriced. In fact, it may still represent good value.\n\nNvidia currently trades at 35.4x forward earnings, making it more expensive than the S&P 500 (SPX), but it’s by no means too expensive for the tech sector. Moreover, the company is expected to continue delivering stellar growth throughout the medium term. In fact, Nvidia’s earnings are forecasted to grow by 34.78% annually throughout the medium term.\n\nThis means that Nvidia’s all-important PEG ratio is 1.02. While 1.0 may be considered the benchmark for fair value, I still think this represents good value, noting long-term trends in the AI industry and the market’s bullishness on U.S. tech.\n\nIn turn, this means that Nvidia is trading at 29.77x earnings for 2026, 25.26x earnings for 2027, and 21.49x earnings for 2028. Moreover, it’s worth recognizing that Nvidia just keeps on beating analysts’ most bullish forecasts. That’s always a good sign, and maybe it could continue to beat expectations, going forward.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nDue to its enabling position in the AI revolution and its attractive valuation metrics, Nvidia stock earns a Strong Buy from analysts. Currently, Nvidia has 39 Buys, two Hold ratings, and zero Sell ratings. The average Nvidia stock target price is $913.74, inferring 1.1% upside potential. The highest share price target is $1,200, and the lowest share price target is $608.40.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nNvidia has been central to the AI revolution, but there are two important things to consider moving forward: Nvidia’s competitive advantage in the all-important generative AI market and the fact that the AI revolution has only just begun.\n\nOver the past 18 months, Nvidia has found itself with a formidable moat, which it has successfully built upon. Other companies, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), have eyes on Nvidia’s crown, but it’s not clear how they will catch up. The Santa Clara-based firm’s new H200 chipset is the must-have for generative AI and large language models. The H200 is thought to be between 1.4 and 1.9 times faster than the H100 when it comes to large language model inference. That’s an impressive jump in just one year.\n\nMoreover, the market is growing and has the potential to grow much faster. SoftBank’s (OTC:SFTBY) Masayoshi Son is considering a $100 billion venture in the AI chip space, and OpenAI’s Sam Altman is reportedly looking for $7 trillion for a string of AI chip factories that would respond to burgeoning demand and restructure the world’s semiconductor sector.\n\nGiven the near-term momentum in the sector, the fact that demand for GPUs still outstrips supply, and the fact that we really are just at the start of the AI revolution, I remain bullish on Nvidia.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Tech Fund Beating 99% of Peers Says AI Rally Is Just Starting",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The artificial-intelligence stock rally is far from over, according to the manager of one of the best-performing tech funds this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBaltimore Wants to Sell Hundreds of Vacant Homes for $1 Each Sam Bankman-Fried Says 50-Year Sentence Only Suitable for a ‘Super Villain’ Justice Department to Sue Apple for Antitrust Violations as Soon as Thursday Trump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Fed Signals Three Rate Cuts Are Still Likely, Despite Inflation Uptick\n\nTony Wang, whose $9 billion T Rowe Price Science & Technology Fund beat 99% of peers last year too, says the AI sector isn’t in a bubble. Nvidia Corp., the poster child for the AI craze that’s up more than 80% year-to-date, is the fund’s biggest holding.\n\nMultiples “are very reasonable right now,” Wang said in an interview. “We will get a downturn eventually, but I think it’s really hard to call the top here and I think it still feels a little early.”\n\nNvidia’s stellar earnings results in the past couple of quarters helped trigger a fierce rally in AI-related stocks like its supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and others like Micron Technology Inc. They’re riding on optimism that an inflection point has arrived thanks to accelerated computing.\n\nBut the speed and pace of the rally have caused skepticism and rekindled memories of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, when fund managers like Ryan Jacob rode the hot tech market to triple-digit annual returns. The Nasdaq Composite Index almost quadrupled from the end of 1996 through its peak in March 2000, before tumbling nearly 80% to a 2002 trough.\n\nTo Wang, a crucial difference with the current rally as compared to the dot-com bubble is backing from real corporate profits, rather than pure valuation expansion. Nvidia, for example, is trading at about 35 times forward earnings, down from a peak around 70 in 2021. So he’s taking advantage of the skepticism.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Heading into the year, the reason why we bet so big on AI and Nvidia is because everyone was concerned about it,” Wang said. “They have like tremendous free cash flow, they’re well capitalized, they have real businesses.”\n\nNvidia’s GPU\n\nEarlier this week, Nvidia’s co-founder Jensen Huang answered critics with a new GPU, Blackwell, the next generation of its hardware that is multiple times faster at handling the models that underpin AI.\n\nNvidia Expects to Win Outsized Chunk of Data Center Spending\n\nWang isn’t bullish on everything. He sold holdings in Chinese companies and invested them in US names this year. His fund exited China’s biggest stocks including Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. — which have been boosting spending on their own large language models. Now he holds a small number of Chinese companies. He cited opportunity cost as a key reason.\n\n“There’s a ton of innovation in the US where companies are seeing significant AI traction and earnings acceleration,” Wang said. “That’s where I’m finding the most opportunities.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Selling Shohei Ohtani: Can Baseball’s Biggest Talent Transform the Sport?

        "content": "Momentum is a powerful force in the stock market. Once a stock becomes popular, its ascent can defy logic and lead to a stretched valuation. While some popular stocks crash within a few months, others live up to the hype.\n\nA swift recovery in 2023 has carried into 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both up year-to-date. Some investors look for opportunities to outperform the established benchmarks. While following the crowds isn’t always the best approach, strong fundamentals can justify a stampede among investors. These top stocks are generating plenty of attention.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a beauty brand rapidly gaining market share and continues to reward long-term investors. The stock is up by roughly 1,800% over the past five years and is already off to a strong start with a 35% year-to-date gain. Shares trade at an 87 P/E ratio and are in the middle of a healthy correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHigh growth rates for revenue and earnings have propelled the stock over the years. The firm reported its 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. It wasn’t a small growth rate either. Net sales were 85% higher in Q3 FY24 year-over-year (YoY).\n\nNet income also got a strong boost and was up by 41% YoY. E.l.f. Beauty used some of those proceeds to acquire Naturism, a fast-growing, high-performance skin brand. The company funded the acquisition with cash and company stock.\n\nThe cosmetics company raised its fiscal 2024 outlook across the board. Net sales are expected to reach $980 to $990 million compared to $896 to $906 million in the previous fiscal 2024 outlook. The previous guidance also projected diluted EPS to range from $2.47 to $2.50, while it now ranges from $2.84 to $2.87 per share.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has captured headlines for several years, but the artificial intelligence boom has created an incredible stampede among investors. The stock is up by more than 1,900% over the past five years and has already gained 82% year-to-date.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Nvidia has a 75 P/E ratio, the chipmaker’s revenue and earnings growth suggest a better valuation is on the horizon. Nvidia’s 265% YoY revenue growth and 769% YoY GAAP net income growth in Q4 FY24 outpaced the stock’s 1-year gain of 249%.\n\nAs long as net income growth keeps up with the stock’s appreciation, shares can continue to move higher. Nvidia’s profit margins have soared alongside its earnings, with net profit margins surpassing 50% for the past two quarters.\n\nNvidia has delivered generational gains for some investors. Some investors may feel as if the stock is due for a crash since assets don’t go up forever. However, Nvidia still has the financial strength and tailwinds to gain from here. The firm’s latest AI chips recently added more fuel to the rally.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a construction company specializing in e-infrastructure. Many blue-chip companies turn to Sterling for assistance with developing data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, warehouses and more. It’s the company’s fastest-growing segment, but the corporation also offers solutions for transportation and home building.\n\nThe stock has done well so far. It’s up 770% over the past five years and has already gained 25% year-to-date. The firm generated $486.0 million in revenue and $40.2 million in net income in the fourth quarter of 2023. Those are YoY growth rates of 8.3% and 99%, respectively.\n\nSterling Infrastructure closed out the quarter with a $2.07 billion backlog. The company’s backlog exceeds the $1.97 billion it generated in full-year 2023. The firm still has a reasonable 24 P/E ratio and is valued at over $3 billion. The stock also has a reasonable 1.09 PEG ratio.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF and NVDA.

        "title": "Nvidia's GTC was CEO Jensen Huang's big moment",
        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang might as well have pitched a flag in the ground during his keynote at the company’s GTC conference on Monday, declaring that the chip giant is not only the go-to AI firm of today, but the key for tech’s future.\n\nOver the course of the two-hour presentation, the CEO rattled off a raft of new Nvidia technologies, including its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, to a crowd so large it packed the rafters of San Jose’s SAP Center.\n\nI’ve been to my fair share of tech events over the years, and this was the first time in quite a while that attendees gave off an overwhelming sense of excitement and anticipation for what was to come.\n\nHuang used the moment as a victory lap for Nvidia, going over how the company went from a video game powerhouse to an AI darling. He extolled the virtues and opportunities of generative AI, recalled how Nvidia’s early investments helped kick off the modern AI race in 2012, and how it’s powering the conversation today.\n\nThose investments have indeed paid off in the form of massive sales increases. In its last fiscal quarter, Nvidia reported data center revenue of $18.4 billion, a 217% increase from the same period last year when it reported data center revenue of $3.62 billion. CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThese gains have painted Nvidia’s stock chart into a Matterhorn, with shares of the company up more than 500% since the start of 2023. All of a sudden, Nvidia is the third-most-valuable company in the world by market capitalization, ahead of giants like Saudi Aramco, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nThe biggest moment of the show came early, as the CEO took the wraps off of Nvidia’s new chips. Nvidia’s GB200 Superchip and its “Blackwell” architecture will offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the Nvidia H100 GPU for large language model inference workloads while using up to 25x less energy, which would make AI more efficient and cheaper.\n\nHuang also showed off the company’s DGX SuperPOD supercomputer setup, which uses piped liquid coolant instead of traditional fan-based cooling. It’s a reminder that the company isn’t just a chip company, or even a software one, but also a larger engineering organization innovating at multiple levels. (And, like so many others, also a cooling company!)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CEO spent a good deal of his keynote hitting on some of the finer points of the math and science behind how Nvidia’s GPUs operate. And besides the engineers and scientists in the crowd, the information seemed to go over many attendees’ heads.\n\nIt makes sense that Huang would hit on those topics, though. GTC is a developer conference, after all — not a consumer one — and you will not be going out and ordering a bag of Nvidia chips. But developers need to know the nitty gritty of what the company’s chips can do.\n\nStill, it was interesting to see who in the audience was nerding out to the numbers and calculations and who was there for the broader strokes of Nvidia’s product roadmap.\n\nAfter showing off a litany of AI software designed for everything from Nvidia’s Omniverse platform to self-driving cars, Huang debuted the company’s GR00T foundation model for humanoid robots. The system is meant to serve as the brains behind these human-like robots, helping them understand human language and mimic human movements.\n\nIt’s not clear when or if GR00T, which stands for Generalist Robot 00 Technology, will take off as a go-to AI system for robots. After all, we’re still in the early stages of humanoid robot development. But Huang is clearly making the case that Nvidia should be the company to help power the segment going forward.\n\nAll of this comes as Nvidia keeps its eyes on a growing field of competitors. Longtime rival AMD is also building out AI enterprise chips and technologies, and Intel is working to steal away its own piece of Nvidia’s pie. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia’s customers are also working on their own AI graphics chips. Two of them, Amazon and Google, have already deployed their own cards in their respective data centers. And two more, Microsoft and Meta, are developing their chips for future use.\n\nFor now, though, the company continues to hold on to its position as the industry leader in AI hardware and software. And Huang seems dead set on staying there.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "Teradyne TER is strengthening its footprint in the field of robotics on the back of its recent partnership with NVIDIA NVDA to integrate advanced AI capabilities into its automation solutions.\r\n\r\nTeaming up with NVIDIA, Teradyne's robotics division, which comprises Universal Robots (UR) and Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR), is set to transform automation applications with AI-powered technologies.\r\n\r\nTeradyne’s UR division seamlessly integrated NVIDIA’s accelerated computing into its collaborative robot (cobot) platform, resulting in path planning speeds that are 50-80 times faster than current solutions.\r\n\r\nThe integration utilizes the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin module and cuMotion path planner from the NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator platform, coupled with UR's PolyScope X software. MiR introduced the MiR1200 Pallet Jack, equipped with advanced AI pallet detection powered by NVIDIA's Jetson AGX Orin module, enabling precise pallet handling even in dynamic and complex environments.\n\nTeradyne, Inc. Price and Consensus Teradyne, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nTeradyne, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Teradyne, Inc. Quote\n\nTeradyne’s Prospects Driven by Strong Portfolio\n\nTeradyne is bolstering its position in the robotics industry by capitalizing on its robust and diversified portfolio. This initiative aligns seamlessly with Teradyne Robotics' commitment to advancing automation capabilities through collaborative partnerships and technological integration.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, the Robotics segment, particularly UR, experienced significant growth, with revenues up 17% year on year and 50% sequentially. The surge was driven by the successful ramp-up in shipments of Teradyne's UR20 cobot and the introduction of the new UR30 model, both of which significantly contributed to the segment's strong performance.\r\n\r\nTeradyne's expansion of its Robotics customer base by integrating more than 50 new OEM partners and significantly augmenting the number of large accounts managed directly from nearly 100 to more than 250 further solidified its position in the market.\r\n\r\nFurther enhancing semiconductor test interfaces and driving accelerated growth, TER forged a partnership with Technoprobe in November, last year. This partnership saw the company investing $516 million in Technoprobe, while Technoprobe acquiring Teradyne's DIS business for $85 million.\r\n\r\nHowever, the overall weak demand environment and weakness in the hard disk drive market has been a headwind.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Teradyne expects revenues between $540 million and $590 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $571.71 million, indicating decline of 7.42% year-over-year.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP earnings are expected between 22 cents and 38 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 37 cents per share, decreased by a couple of pennies over the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nTeradyne currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\r\n\r\nTER’s shares have declined 4.6% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 9.9%.\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector are BILL Holdings BILL and Cadence Design Systems CDNS, each sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nBILL Holdings’ shares have declined 18.5% in the year-to-date period.

Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAWS Portfolio Strength, Competitive Scenario\n\nThe latest move bodes well for Amazon’s concerted efforts to expand the AWS portfolio, which has been driving its cloud customer momentum. Moreover, AWS's strength has been acting as a key catalyst behind Amazon’s growth. AMZN shares have returned 74.9% over a year.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’s solid customer base, on the back of its expanding portfolio, as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nAmazon, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in fourth-quarter 2023, per the latest Synergy Research Group data. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nNotably, AWS generated revenues of $24.2 billion (14% of total sales) in the same quarter, up 13% year over year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 24% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $25.9 billion in revenues (41.7% of the total revenues), up 20% year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2024. The business is benefiting from the solid adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. The Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 30% year over year. Microsoft is also making strong efforts to power its cloud capabilities with generative AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, increasing data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 11% of the market, and reported revenues of $9.19 billion (10.6% of the total revenues) in fourth-quarter 2023, up 25.7% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s Growing Generative AI Efforts\n\nThe extended collaboration with NVIDIA is in sync with Amazon’s growing efforts toward bolstering its generative AI.\r\n\r\nAWS’s announcement regarding the general availability of its fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock, which provides seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company also made the Amazon Titan Embeddings model generally available. It added Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model, which will be available through API.\r\n\r\nAWS offers a new capability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to offer generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market’s value is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s solidifying prospects in this promising market are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "IBM Eyes First Record Since 2013 as AI Optimism Fuels 19% Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — One of the oldest companies in tech has been quietly trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite Neighborhood Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. recently hit its highest since 2013, putting it about 6% below an all-time high as investors bet that a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBM’s 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n“IBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,” said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firm’s cash flow generation and “healthy” dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.\n\nMuch of the year’s advance followed IBM’s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.\n\nThe stock’s surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBM’s 82% gain over the same period.\n\nWall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBM’s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent.\n\nThat hasn’t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBM’s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the company’s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“The CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. “We can easily do better elsewhere.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIn a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its biggest companies, an index of small-cap tech stocks is down 7% this year, making it a dramatic underperformer compared with other size categories. The S&P 500 tech sector index, which tracks large-cap tech stocks, is up 12% in 2024. However, an index of mid-cap tech has done best of all, with a gain of 14%.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nThe Biden administration is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co. after the telecom giant notched a significant technological breakthrough last year, people familiar with the matter said. The US will award Intel Corp. $8.5 billion in grants and as much as $11 billion in loans to help fund an expansion of its semiconductor factories, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday, marking the largest award from a program designed to reinvigorate the domestic chip industry. Tencent Holdings Ltd. plans to more than double its stock buyback program to at least $12.8 billion in 2024, mollifying investors concerned about a gradual dissipation of growth during a Chinese economic downturn. Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea’s largest company. PocketHealth Inc. has raised $33 million from new investors including Deloitte Ventures and Samsung Next, joining a growing crop of startups gathering capital to explore the use of AI in healthcare.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nJinkoSolar Kingsoft Cloud Postmarket\n\nMicron\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion China’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers’ $700 Million Man, Will Transform Baseball—If He Wants To Julius Baer Hits Reboot to Escape Swiss Banking’s New Malaise Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside. To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer among the major market indices in 2022 and made a stellar comeback in 2023. The index was down 33% at the end of 2022 and recovered from its abysmal performance with a 43% gain in 2023. To put things in perspective, the Nasdaq Composite index hit its previous record in November 2021 with a little over 16,000 points, and it was still a thousand points behind it by the end of 2023, even after the outstanding performance during the year. However, the index has hit new highs and is at 16,275 at March 1 market close. The Nasdaq-100, which includes the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial companies in the world, recorded its fourth-best performance since 1986, with a 53.81% gain in 2023.\n\nNasdaq’s performance is attributed to the fact that it is mostly concentrated in tech stocks, which were the best performers of the year in 2023. The Magnificent 7 stocks remained in the limelight as several of the top performers of the index were a part of the group, which include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and they gained 239% and 194% in 2023, respectively. However, some other stocks made significant strides through the year as well. Some of them are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) gained nearly 128%, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was 110% higher by the end of 2023. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) performed even more spectacularly in 2023 and is still on a remarkable upward trajectory in the current year. As of March 18, the stock has gained more than 900% over the past 12 months.\n\nAlthough 5 of the magnificent 7 stocks are still performing well and their price charts are still in green on a year-to-date basis, as of March 18, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have declined significantly. Apple is down 4.61%, and Tesla has also fallen out of favor among many analysts and is down 32% year-to-date. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest still sees long-term growth for Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock due to its autonomous driving software. Last year, Wood said in an interview on CNBC that she believes that the company’s stock price will hit the $2000 mark by 2027. In 2024, the investor is still bullish on the stock. Ark Invest bought $141 million worth of Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock in January, as reported by Bloomberg on January 29. The firm also bought over $35 million worth of company shares on March 14, as reported by Business Insider on the same day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs There a Stop to the AI Rally?\n\nInvestors and analysts keep mixed reviews about the rising AI trend. While some believe that the AI surge could be a bubble and that tech stocks are now overvalued, others hold the opinion that AI is a revolutionary trend that will dominate the market for years to come. Looking at recent earnings of the tech stocks, the latter scenario is more likely.\n\nThe industry leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q4 earnings on February 21. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was up 28% sequentially, and was 486% higher than last year. Furthermore, its revenue increased by 265% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.1 billion. The company's gross margin also increased by 10.6%, year over year, to 76.7% in the quarter. On March 18, Truist and HSBC raised NVIDIA’s price target by $266 and $170, respectively. Truist has a price target of $1,177 for the stock, while HSBC’s Frank Lee raised NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $1050. The stock is currently trading at around $885, as of March 18.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-rate earnings report, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also showed strength in its earnings in the fourth quarter due to a high demand for its artificial intelligence servers. The company reported an EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $22.32 billion, which outperformed the market estimates by $0.48 and $150 million, respectively. The stock gained 31.5% in a day on March 1 and is up nearly 13% month-to-date as of March 18. Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) also increased its quarterly dividend by 20%. The company’s earnings revived investor belief in AI, and most of the industry-related stocks moved higher during the day. At Dell Technologies’ (NYSE:DELL) Q4 2024 earnings call, COO and Vice Chairman of the company, Jeffrey Clark, highlighted the demand growth for AI-optimized servers. He said:\n\n“AI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements.”\n\nNow let us continue to our list of NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside potential, which includes Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).

Next, we checked each stock’s analyst ratings and price targets on TipRanks. We then chose the 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside at the time of writing on March 18 and listed the stocks in ascending order.\n\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of Q4, 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside\n\n10. Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 22.99%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is a Texas-based company that offers energy and industrial solutions. According to TipRanks, the stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy as per the 14 Wall Street analysts that covered it over the past three months. The average price target of $39.85 implies an upside of 22.99% from the current levels at the time of writing on March 18.\n\nOn February 21, Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) announced that it won a significant and multi-year award for the provision of integrated well construction services for rigs in the Buzios pre-salt field offshore Brazil. The work on the three rigs is expected to begin in the first half of 2025.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) was part of 47 hedge funds’ portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a total stake value of $911.825 million. AQR Capital Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth nearly $137.851 million, as of Q4, 2023.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is one of the top NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside, along with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Performance was boosted in the quarter by the Strategy’s more economically-sensitive holdings among steady compounders and evolving opportunities. Oilfield equipment and services provider Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), meanwhile, benefited from a $20 rise in crude oil prices as well as disciplined execution.”\n\n9. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 44.79%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInsulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and distributing insulin management systems for diabetic patients. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds had stakes in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) with total positions worth $1.197 billion. This is compared to 44 funds with positions worth $938.370 million in the preceding quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $288.885 million.\n\nOn February 7, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) announced that its Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system with Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor received CE Mark approval.\n\nIn the past three months, 12 Wall Street analysts have covered Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), and 9 maintain a Buy rating on the stock. At the time of writing on March 18, the average price target of $238.33 has an upside of 44.79% from present levels.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Results were primarily impacted by weakness among two health care holdings, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) and Surgery Partners. Positive clinical studies for GLP-1 therapeutics showed substantial health benefits to diabetic and obese patients, boosting stock prices of pharmaceutical companies tied to the manufacturing of these drugs. The potential for improved patient outcomes raised the risk of lower utilization for Insulet, a maker of insulin patch pumps, and Surgery Partners, whose outpatient surgery centers conduct weight loss and many other types of outpatient procedures. Though the GLP-1 threat is weighing on the valuation multiple of Insulet, any negative effects would likely not meaningfully affect the business for many years, especially given how large and underpenetrated the Type 2 diabetes market is for the company currently. Additionally, this could require significant improvements in cost, availability, and adherence for GLP-1s. Furthermore, we are encouraged that the majority of Insulet’s business today is still from Type 1 diabetes, where fundamentals remain strong and the company is gaining share.”\n\n8. First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 50.15%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nFirst Solar, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 61.26%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is a New York-based media and entertainment company.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management’s ability to deliver going forward.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Worst Bachelor’s Degrees for Student Loan Debt 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024 13 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "History Says You'll Regret Buying Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "There's a shortage of high-powered chips capable of training and running advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Mega-tech companies are battling each other for AI supremacy, scooping up boatloads of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) data center GPUs along the way, and AI start-ups with rocketing valuations are multiplying.\n\nThere's little question that AI is a revolutionary technology. There's also little question, at least in my mind, that AI is fueling a classic bubble. Start-ups founded less than a year ago, like Mistral AI, are already worth billions. Some publicly traded companies, notably server maker Super Micro Computer, have seen their valuations skyrocket to levels that seem illogical. Caution is increasingly being thrown to the wind.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are driving the AI revolution\n\nNvidia and its GPUs are at the center of it all. Not only are the company's GPUs well suited for the calculations necessary for training and running AI models, but its proprietary CUDA platform has become the de facto standard for accelerated computing over the past 16 years. With companies scrambling to win the AI race, Nvidia's GPUs are the path of least resistance.\n\nIt's not surprising then that demand for Nvidia's AI accelerators has exploded. The company's data center segment generated $18.4 billion of revenue in its latest quarter, a fivefold increase from the prior-year period. Profits are soaring as well. In the recently completed fiscal 2024, Nvidia earned a net income of $32.3 billion of $60.9 billion of revenue.\n\nNvidia stock has more than tripled over the past year, pushing up the company's market capitalization beyond $2 trillion.\n\nShortages don't last forever\n\n\"I've seen gluts not followed by shortages, but I've never seen a shortage not followed by a glut,\" says Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who is regarded as an expert on risk. The inertia behind Nvidia's CUDA has slowed down competitors, but a tsunami of competing AI accelerators is building. Nvidia's incredible profits and pricing power won't survive once supply catches up with demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices launched new AI-centric data center GPUs late last year. Intel will launch the third generation of its capable Gaudi line of AI accelerators this year. OpenAI's Sam Altman is reportedly seeking vast funding for new semiconductor factories to build AI chips. Cloud giants including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are designing and installing their own AI chips. The list goes on.\n\nHere's how the current shortage turns into a glut. First, insatiable demand and extravagant long-term projections drive a wave of competition. This is what's happening now. AMD has predicted that the AI chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. For perspective, global semiconductor sales were just over $500 billion last year.\n\nSecond, future demand inevitably falls short of these wild projections. AI chip demand can still soar in the coming years and miss expectations, given how optimistic industry players have become. Eventually, this leads to a situation where there's more than enough supply of AI chips.\n\nAt this point, Nvidia's pricing power would have eroded considerably. CUDA would no longer be dominant as alternatives pop up and gain traction. For big cloud companies, there's a strong incentive to be able to support AI accelerators from a wide variety of suppliers.\n\nLook to the dot-com bubble\n\nThis isn't the first time Nvidia's stock has soared thanks to a revolutionary technology. The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s pushed up the company's valuation to extreme levels as well. The aftermath was a disaster for shareholders. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nRelative to sales, Nvidia stock is far more expensive today than at any point during the dot-com bubble. \"This time is different,\" you might say. Demand for AI is real, and the company's revenue is soaring. But you've just uttered the four most dangerous words in investing.\n\nThis time might be different. Or the market dynamics that play out during nearly every shortage of anything will play out once again and grind down Nvidia's pricing power and profits. By investing in Nvidia, you'll likely be paying a high price to relearn the lessons of the dot-com bubble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Have Up to 102% Upside, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, a seemingly endless stream of next-big-thing investment opportunities have captivated the attention of professional and everyday investors. Innovations, such as the advent of the internet, have changed the respective growth arc of the U.S. economy.\n\nRight now, no investment trend has folks more excited than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. The not-so-secret ingredient that's fueled the potential for AI is machine learning (ML), which allows software and systems to \"learn\" and become more proficient at their tasks over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI is widely believed to have application in most sectors and industries. It's encompassing use compelled the researchers at PwC to predict a whopping $15.7 trillion bump in global gross domestic product (GDP) from AI by 2030.\n\nThe undeniable potential of artificial intelligence isn't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Price targets for most AI stocks have soared over the past year and change. This has been especially true for leading AI stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nA trio of AI stocks may offer greater upside than Nvidia\n\nJust shy of one month ago, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann initiated a Street-high price target of $1,400 per share on Nvidia. Should Mosesmann's prognostication prove accurate, Wall Street's darling AI stock would gain 59% and add about $1.3 trillion to its already lofty market cap.\n\nThere has certainly been an abundance of reasons for investors to fall in love with Nvidia. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become staples in high-compute data centers. As a result, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptional pricing power on its AI-accelerated GPUs and completely blown Wall Street's sales and profit forecasts out of the water. To boot, a majority of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are aggressively purchasing its Ai infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, trouble may be brewing in paradise. While it's no secret that external competition is building in the AI-GPU arena, what many investors appear to be overlooking is that Nvidia's four largest customers by sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are developing AI-GPUs of their own. These four businesses are aiming to lessen their reliance on Nvidia's chips and appear poised to reduce the magnitude of their orders in future years.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's growth has the potential to be its own undoing in the current and subsequent fiscal years (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January). GPU scarcity has been a driving force behind Nvidia's data-center sales growth. As it increases its own production and external/internal competition ramps up, GPU scarcity will lessen. When it does, Nvidia's GPU pricing power, and thus its gross margin, should meaningfully contract.\n\nDespite Mosesmann's lofty price target, three other AI stocks could yield juicier returns, based on the high-water price targets of select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJD.com: Implied upside of 100%\n\nThe first company depending on AI solutions to fuel its growth that could outpace Nvidia in the return department is China's JD.com(NASDAQ: JD). Analyst Fawne Jiang of Benchmark set a price target of $55 on shares of JD less than two weeks ago, which would imply upside of 100%, based on where the stock closed on March 15.\n\nJD firmly announced its entrance into the AI race last summer when it introduced large language model (LLM) ChatRhino. JD aims to leverage its LLM technology within the industrial setting to shorten innovation timelines and lessen supply chain issues within the finance, health, retail, and logistics space. Though development for ChatRhino began in 2021, JD's team of engineers wanted to fine-tune the technology before introducing it on a broader scale.\n\nWhile JD.com is counting on AI to power its growth potential, the company's foundational operating segment continues to be its e-commerce platform. JD slides in behind Alibaba as China's No. 2 online retail marketplace.\n\nWhat's helped differentiate JD from Alibaba is its e-commerce operating model. Whereas Alibaba has leaned heavily on third-party marketplaces, JD operates as a true direct-to-consumer (DTC) company. In other words, it handles the inventory and logistics of getting purchased products to consumers. Having more control of these various DTC processes means JD can deliver superior margins over the long run.\n\nJD.com is cheap, as well. Even following its recent rally, shares are valued at just 8 times forward-year earnings. This makes Jiang's $55 price target a genuine possibility.\n\nSentinelOne: Implied upside of 68%\n\nA second AI stock that offers more upside than Nvidia, at least based on the forecast of one Wall Street analyst, is endpoint cybersecurity company SentinelOne(NYSE: S). Analyst Peter Weed at Bernstein expects SentinelOne will reach $37 per share, which would yield 68% upside to come if he's correct.\n\nThe beauty of cybersecurity solutions is that they've become a basic necessity. No matter what's happening with the U.S. economy, hackers and robots don't take time off from trying to steal sensitive enterprise data. Third-party providers like SentinelOne are increasingly seeing the onus of protection falling onto their shoulders.\n\nSentinelOne's platform, known as Singularity, leans on AI and ML. The incorporation of AI and ML allows Singularity to \"learn\" so it can become more effective at identifying and responding to potential threats over time.\n\nAlthough its growth ramp has been a bit bumpy at times, the company's key performance indicators suggest its platform is finding the mark with businesses. Of particular note, SentinelOne counted 1,133 customers generating at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR), as of Jan. 31, 2024, which is up 30% from the prior-year period. Rapidly rising ARR above the $100,000 mark suggests the company is landing larger clients, which is a necessity if it's to turn the corner to recurring profitability.\n\nSentinelOne's subscription pricing model is also a benefit. Subscription-driven models often lead to predictable cash flow and improve customer retention.\n\nThough getting from Point A to B rarely occurs in a straight line on Wall Street, Weed's price target may be within reach over the next two years.\n\nBaidu: Implied upside of 102%\n\nLast but not least, Wall Street's high-water price target on China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) suggests it can run circles around the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia. Analyst Fawne Jiang of Benchmark, who believes JD.com can double, has also placed a $210 price target on Baidu. If this level were to become reality, Baidu's shareholders would enjoy a 102% increase in value.\n\nBaidu's ties to AI come in two forms. First, it operates one of the largest AI cloud infrastructure service platforms in China. Enterprise cloud spending is still taking off, so there's a real chance Baidu can enjoy sustained double-digit growth from its AI Cloud segment.\n\nSecondly, Baidu is the parent of Apollo Go, the world's most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service. This intelligent-driving company has overseen more than 5 million accumulated rides since its inception.\n\nWhile these AI-driven operating segments are providing a lift to Baidu's organic growth rate, the company's cash-cow segment remains its internet search engine. According to data from GlobalStats, Baidu accounted for 60.1% of internet search share in the world's No. 2 economy by GDP in February. With few exceptions, Baidu's search engine has maintained a 60% to 85% share of internet search in China over the past nine years. As the clear go-to for merchants wanting to target consumers, Baidu should enjoy exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nFurther, Baidu is sitting on a mountain of capital. As of the end of 2023, it held north of $28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various short-term investments. This capital gives Baidu plenty of flexibility on the innovation front, while providing a healthy downside buffer for its stock.\n\nBaidu's forward price-to-earnings ratio of a little over 8 is remarkably cheap, which suggests the stock has a reasonable shot of hitting Jiang's price target of $210 within the next 12-to-24 months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Led the First Phase of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but These 2 Growth Stocks Will Lead the Next Phases, According to a Wall Street Team",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has undoubtedly led the first phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its share price soared 245% over the past year as businesses clamored to buy its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become synonymous with AI. But analysts at Goldman Sachs see Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as a leader in the second and fourth phases of AI, and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) as a leader in the third phase.\n\nThe four phases are detailed below. Investors should not think of them as distinct events, but rather as a continuum where a new phase can begin well before the previous one has ended. In other words, all four periods will overlap to some degree.\n\nPhase 1: Semiconductor companies will generate revenue from chips designed to support AI workloads. Phase 2: Cloud businesses will produce revenue by providing access to AI infrastructure. Phase 3: Cloud companies will generate revenue by incorporating AI into software and services. Phase 4: Many different kinds of organizations will use AI internally to improve operational efficiency.\n\nThe Goldman analyst team has made sensible selections. Amazon is the largest cloud services provider in the world and the company is already using AI to make its logistics business more efficient. Similarly, Cloudflare has a substantial opportunity to monetize AI through its Workers developer platform, so much so that management believes it could be a leader in AI inferencing.\n\nRead on to find out why both stocks could be worthwhile long-term investments.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is best known for its e-commerce empire. The company operates the most visited online marketplace in the world, and it has reinforced its leadership position by investing heavily in logistics capabilities. That strategy not only allows Amazon to control costs, but also enables the company to support sellers with fulfillment services and delight buyers with timely delivery.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has used its dominance in online retail to create a thriving advertising business. In fact, Amazon has become the third-largest adtech company in the world, and Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt believes it \"is well positioned to continue taking share of global digital advertising spending over a multi-year period.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top dog in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several subcategories of the cloud computing market. Most notably, consultancy Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) developer services.\n\nAmazon looked strong in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion due to momentum in e-commerce and advertising, as well as a sequential acceleration in cloud computing revenue. Meanwhile, GAAP net income reached $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year, indicating that cost-control efforts are paying off.\n\nLooking ahead, AI should be a tailwind for Amazon, both in terms of improving efficiency and boosting revenue. For instance, the company is using machine learning to optimize inventory and delivery routes. That should support continued margin expansion, especially in conjunction with its new regional fulfillment strategy, which reduced shipping costs on a per-unit basis in 2023 for the first time since 2018, according to CEO Andy Jassy.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon recently introduced Bedrock, a cloud service for building generative AI applications. The company also announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant. Both products create new monetization opportunities that should help Amazon tap growing demand for AI. Indeed, Jassy believes investments in AI will \"drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow revenue by 11% annually over the next five years. That estimate makes its current valuation of 3.2 times sales seem reasonable, though it is a slight premium to the three-year average of 2.9 times sales.\n\nI think Goldman has the right idea where Amazon is concerned. Patient investors should consider buying a few shares of this top AI stock today.\n\n2. Cloudflare\n\nCloudflare provides application, network, and security services that improve the performance of corporate infrastructure and software across public clouds and private data centers. Additionally, the company offers compute and storage services through its Workers developer platform that help businesses build and deploy applications, and it has been particularly focused on enabling artificial intelligence.\n\nLast year, CEO Matthew Prince said, \"By our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across leading AI start-ups.\" He also stated that the company was \"uniquely positioned to become a leader in AI inferencing.\" Prince was referring to Workers AI, a recently launched service that lets businesses run AI applications on Nvidia GPUs installed across its network.\n\nCloudflare operates the fastest cloud network on the market, and Forrester Research recently recognized the company as the leader in edge development platforms. Those qualities could indeed help Cloudflare become a major player in the AI inferencing market, despite tough competition from Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nCloudflare reported strong fourth-quarter financial results. Its customer count climbed 17% and the average existing customer spent 15% more over the past year. In turn, revenue increased 32% to $362 million in the fourth quarter, and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to $53 million. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue\n\nGoing forward, Grand View Research believes the edge computing market will grow by 37% annually through 2030, and Cloudflare is poised to capitalize on that opportunity given its strong position in edge development platforms. But the International Data Corp. has also ranked Cloudflare as a leader in zero-trust network access, and that market is forecast to expand by 17% annually through 2030.\n\nCollectively, Cloudflare has a good shot at 20% annual revenue growth through the end of the decade, and that estimate could be conservative depending on how well the company monetizes AI. Either way, its present valuation of 23.7 times sales is tolerable. To be clear, that multiple is not cheap, so shares will almost certainly be volatile. But patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in this growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "Many of the market's top cryptocurrencies surged over the past 12 months. Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) price rose more than 180% as the first spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved and investors looked toward the next \"halving\" which will cut the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half this April. Ethereum's (CRYPTO: ETH) price has also jumped nearly 130% as the Ethereum Network's big Dencun upgrade and hopes for fresh ETF approvals brought back the bulls.\n\nExpectations for stable or lower interest rates also drove more investors back toward cryptocurrencies. That shift might herald the end of the \"crypto winter\" that started in 2022, but cryptocurrencies are still riskier than most tech stocks -- since they're only trading on supply and demand instead of the growth of an underlying business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo if you're looking for growth but can't stomach the crypto market's wild swings, you can buy some high-growth tech stocks, which might still have more upside potential than the top cryptocurrencies. I believe Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) check all the right boxes. Let's find out a bit more about these three tech stocks with so much potential.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia became the world's third-most-valuable company in early March. Its market cap hit $2.2 trillion as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market drove more companies to purchase its data center GPUs to process their AI tasks.\n\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), which greatly reduced its dependence on gaming and professional visualization GPUs for the PC market. The expansion of that business was driven by the soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 126% and 288%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 as the AI market grew. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to soar another 81% and 89%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Based on those bullish expectations, Nvidia's stock doesn't seem expensive at 36 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro (as the company is better known) produces high-performance servers for data centers. It controls a smaller slice of the enterprise server market than Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell, but its close relationship with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center GPUs before its larger competitors.\n\nThe partnership enabled Supermicro to carve out a niche in the rapidly growing market for dedicated AI servers. That's why its revenue and adjusted EPS rose 37% and 109%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last June). Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise another 104% and 86%, respectively, in fiscal 2024.\n\nThose are astounding growth rates for a stock that trades at 34 times forward earnings. It's also been developing AI servers that use Advanced Micro Devices' new AI-oriented GPUs -- and that shift should reduce its long-term dependence on Nvidia.\n\n3. ASML\n\nASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems -- which leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing use to manufacture their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\n\nLike many other chipmakers, Nvidia outsources its manufacturing to TSMC -- but TSMC can't produce those high-end chips without ASML's machines. That's why ASML is an indispensable linchpin of the global semiconductor industry. That reputation, along with its lack of meaningful competitors, gives it unmatched pricing power.\n\nASML's revenue and EPS rose 30% and 41%, respectively, in 2023. But in 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise less than 1% as its EPS dips 4%. That slowdown will be caused by tighter export curbs on its shipments to Chinese chipmakers and the excess inventory of chips in the PC and smartphone markets. However, it expects its growth to accelerate again in 2025 as it overcomes those challenges -- so I believe its stock deserves its higher valuation at 43 times forward earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Samsung Jumps Most in Six Months After Nvidia CEO’s Backing",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea’s largest company.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New Team Apple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Ultra-Wealthy Are Souring on Chicago’s Most Elite Neighborhood What Happens If Trump Can’t Post His $454 Million Bond Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips\n\nThe report shored up investor hopes that Samsung — long the dominant player in global memory semiconductors — will close the gap with smaller rival SK Hynix Inc. in the critical field of AI. On Wednesday, executives told shareholders at their annual meeting Samsung aims to be first in the global chip market within two to three years, including by investing in capacity for high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. This type of semiconductor is best suited to work with the AI accelerators that Nvidia specializes in. Samsung’s chip business should recover to 2022 levels this year, as a longstanding market slump begins to end, executives said.\n\nAlready the undisputed leader in AI semiconductors, Nvidia this week unveiled the next generation of its hardware, called Blackwell. Samsung’s shares surged as much as 6% in Seoul after Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told reporters his company planned to also use it as an HBM supplier, according to the newspaper. “I value our partnership with SK Hynix and Samsung very incredibly,” it quoted Huang as saying.\n\nHuang’s endorsement of various partners this week has boosted shares in the likes of Synopsys Inc. Hynix’s own head-start in HBM — which is ideally designed to make the most of Nvidia’s chips — had helped its shares double in value since the start of 2023, far outstripping Samsung’s roughly 39% gain.\n\n“We see a very high possibility that Samsung will qualify for supplying HBM3E to Nvidia’s latest chips,” said Sanjeev Rana, head of Korea Research at CLSA. “The demand for Nvidia’s GPUs is very strong, but given the limited HBM capacity at Hynix and Micron, it is very likely that Nvidia will need to rely on another supplier to meet the strong demand for its chips.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Nvidia CEO Becomes Kingmaker by Name-Dropping Stocks\n\nHBM is a key part of Samsung’s effort to be the world’s leading chipmaker, as the one part of the memory market where Samsung doesn’t enjoy a clear lead over its competition. The company said its HBM sales rose by more than 40% in the December quarter, and that memory demand showed signs of recovery.\n\nBut Hynix is also investing in capacity and technology to safeguard its advantage. Among other things, it’s placing a bet on advanced chip packaging that it thinks will grant it a crucial edge. Samsung is pushing its own advanced packaging business after setting up a dedicated team last year, said Kyung Kye-Hyun, who heads the semiconductor business.\n\nRead More: SK Hynix Invests $1 Billion in Key AI Memory Chip Technology\n\nBeyond memory, the Suwon-based firm is working to expand its foundry business — fabricating logic chips to the design specification of outside customers, such as Nvidia — and take a larger share of the market now dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\n\n--With assistance from Shinhye Kang and Vlad Savov.\n\n(Updates with market context from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Elon Musk’s Don Lemon Implosion Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers’ $700 Million Man, Will Transform Baseball—If He Wants To Congress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics Say Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Who's Afraid of the Fed's New Dot-Plot?",
        "content": "Tuesday, March 19th, 2024\r\n\r\nMarkets sprang back to life on this first(?) day of spring (I always thought it was the 20th or 21st), coming off more down trading days this month than up days so far (save the Dow, which has 7 up days and 5 down since March 1st). The Dow has its biggest trading session in almost a month, +320 points or +0.83%, while the S&P 500 notched a fresh all-time closing high today: +0.56% to 5178. The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 gained +0.39% and +0.49% today, respectively.\r\n\r\nCiting recent behavior by the market ahead of a big news event the following session — whether it be a major jobs report, CPI, earnings for a market-moving stock, etc. — today’s successful trading day is at odds with what we’ve seen lately: a tepid, if not somewhat bearish, trading day ahead of said “big news.” Tomorrow, this will be the Fed’s decision on interest rates and, likely more consequentially, a new “dot-plot” on future moves the Fed plans to take.\r\n\r\nBack in December, the Fed plotted out three interest rate cuts for 2024, which the market quickly interpreted to roughly double, beginning in March. This is the March meeting that began today and finishes tomorrow at 2pm ET with the new interest rate decision — it will be unchanged; we’ve all seen too much evidence of an economy able to cope with 5.25-5.50% to expect a cut any longer. The key will be what the dot-plot says, and when it starts: will it be June, as widely expected (still)? And if there is a further sense of reluctance to lower rates (we’ve been at these levels for eight-straight months so far), how will the market react to that?\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps if market participants are still overweight NVIDIA NVDA and its partners, maybe it won’t matter so much. Yesterday’s GPU Tech Conference had NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang deliver the keynote address, where he name-dropped smaller partners in next-generation simulation and generative A.I. (Ansys ANSS), software integration for next-generation semiconductors (Synopsis SNPS) and building a new “super computer” with NVIDIA chips (Cadence Design Systems CDNS). With NVDA shares +28% in the past month, +85% year to date, +245% in the last year and +1914% over the past five years, if any company can create its own market, NVIDIA can.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the Fed’s meeting tomorrow, even if a June start to the new dot-plot and three cuts in 2024 remain intact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s tone in the presser following the release will be key. A more rigid attitude from Powell, or even a more vague and wistful one, can affect how late-day trading tomorrow will commence. The best-case scenario is that the Fed agrees to look for the soonest opportunity to cut rates — not all the way back down to 2%, but that which gets the ball rolling downhill — and then keeps its eyes and ears open for signs of strain in the economy from there.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Battle of the Super AI Chips: Time to Buy Nvidia or AMD's Stock?",
        "content": "The impeccable rally in Nvidia NVDA and AMD’s AMD stock has started to wear thin over the last few weeks but of course, corrections can be healthy.\n\nTo that point, investors may once again be pondering if it’s time to buy the dip in these chip leaders as semiconductor development for artificial intelligence remains in high demand.\n\nSuper AI Chip Competition\n\nLuring the buy-the-dip scenario is that on Monday Nvidia announced a new processer design along with a family of chips called Blackwell which it says will now be the most powerful artificial intelligence transistors on the market.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD has largely entered the conversation of new accelerators and processors for AI with its MI300 series chips. AMD’s MI300X chips helped the company take market share by battling Nvidia’s popular H100 series chips which have been used to train large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s chat GPT.\n\nHowever, it's noteworthy that Nvidia has upped the ante as its most recent H200 and GH200 “super chip” was an upgrade to its AI computing platform and already the market leader before its newly announced Blackwell series.\n\nMarket Value\n\nFor now, Nvidia and AMD are considered the leaders in the semiconductor development for AI chips followed by Intel INTC with the market thought to be worth upwards of $60 billion. More intriguing, the AI chip market has a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) that is projected at 30% or higher in the coming years. Statista\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nRecent Performances & 52 Week Range\n\nAt the moment Nvidia’s stock trades just under $900 and roughly 8% from its 52-week highs of $974 a share seen earlier in the month. Nvidia’s stock is more than 250% above its 52-week lows of $251.30 a share seen last March. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD’s stock trades around $182 and has dipped 25% from its 52-week peak of $227.30 a share which it hit a few weeks ago as well. That said, AMD’s stock has soared 125% above its lows of $81.02 a share witnessed last May.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nYear to date, Nvidia’s stock has soared +80% while AMD shares are still up +23% with both impressively topping the broader indexes and largely outperforming Intel’s -16%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Comparisons\n\nGlancing at the outlook for Nvidia, total sales are projected to soar 70% in its current fiscal 2025 to $103.49 billion compared to $60.92 billion in FY24. Even better, FY26 sales are expected to jump another 15%. On the bottom line, Nvidia’s annual earnings are forecasted to leap 81% in FY25 to $23.49 per share versus $12.96 a share in FY24. Fiscal 2025 EPS is projected to rise another 11% to $26.06 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPivoting to AMD, its top line is expected to expand 11% in its current FY24 and climb another 22% in FY25 to $30.97 billion. Annual earnings are projected to climb 30% this year and soar another 46% in FY25 to $5.05 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDeciding Factor\n\nThere is no question that competition is great for the market as it relates to technological advancements. Still, Nvidia continues to have the edge in the development of semiconductors for artificial intelligence after further cementing its dominance with the Blackwell series and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while AMD lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nThe resurgence in US stocks, buoyed by what's been labeled the \"most-crowded trade,\" underscores the market's resilience. Led by a surge in tech megacaps, often referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" equities bounced back, mitigating earlier losses. This trend, characterized by Bank of America Corp., highlights the dominance of a select group of technology giants driving market gains. Notably, Nvidia Corp. experienced a notable uptick, fueled by optimism surrounding its latest chip technology, which is anticipated to catalyze further growth, already evidenced by a staggering $1 trillion increase in the company's market value this year. Simultaneously, the bond market stabilized following a recent downturn, during which traders adjusted their expectations for future policy easing. As Wall Street anticipates the Federal Reserve's decision, scheduled for Wednesday, investors are closely monitoring signals regarding potential adjustments to the rate-cut outlook. Amid these developments, Bank of Japan's Ueda commented on the confirmation of a positive feedback loop between wages and prices, contributing to the broader economic landscape. The collective sentiment among traders underscores the intricate interplay between market dynamics and central bank policies, shaping investment strategies and market movements. As the landscape evolves, market participants remain vigilant, analyzing emerging trends and developments for potential opportunities and risks.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) has made a significant policy shift by abandoning its negative rates and unconventional easing measures, reported CNBC. This move, following robust wage negotiations and signals of sustainable price increases, marks a departure from its long-standing ultra-loose monetary policy. The decision triggered a sharp decline in the Japanese yen, reflecting market reactions to the BOJ's shift towards normalizing monetary policy. Going forward, the BOJ will focus on utilizing short-term interest rates as its primary policy tool, aiming to maintain accommodative financial conditions while gradually scaling back its asset purchases. However, the central bank remains cautious about the pace of rate hikes, considering the fragile economic outlook. While the immediate global impact of the BOJ's decision is expected to be limited, concerns persist about potential volatility stemming from the unwinding of carry trades and capital repatriation to Japan. Nevertheless, the BOJ's gradual approach to policy normalization suggests a measured response to evolving economic conditions. Looking ahead, market analysts anticipate continued adjustments in bond yields and monetary policy as the BOJ navigates the complexities of achieving sustained economic growth. The broader implications of these policy shifts are yet to unfold, with market participants closely monitoring developments and their potential impact on global financial markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets. Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets\n\n10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nUpside Potential: N/A\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo & Company raised their price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares from $141.00 to $144.00 while maintaining an \"equal weight\" rating for the stock. This adjustment signifies the bank's updated assessment of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) valuation and outlook within the technology sector. The move by Wells Fargo & Company reflects their analysis of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) performance and potential future growth opportunities. By increasing the price target, they indicate their belief that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is poised for appreciation, although the specific upside potential is not provided. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), operating in the technology industry, is renowned for its diverse portfolio of products and services, including its dominant search engine, advertising platform, and cloud computing solutions. The company's continued innovation and expansion efforts contribute to its appeal among investors. The decision to maintain an \"equal weight\" rating suggests a balanced view of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock, neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic. Investors may interpret the revised price target as a signal of confidence in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) long-term prospects. It provides guidance for investors evaluating their positions in Alphabet, offering insights into the potential trajectory of the stock price.\n\n09. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)\n\nUpside Potential: 0.60%\n\nOn March 18, Wells Fargo analyst Jeffrey Donnelly affirmed his Equal-Weight rating for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) while increasing the price target from $234 to $250. This adjustment reflects Wells Fargo's updated assessment of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) valuation and prospects within the hospitality industry. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) operates in the hospitality sector and is renowned for its global portfolio of hotels and resorts spanning various brands and segments. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as travel trends, economic conditions, and competition within the industry. By raising the price target, Wells Fargo indicates a modest upside potential of 0.60% for Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) stock compared to its current market price of $248.52. This suggests that while Wells Fargo remains relatively neutral on Marriott's prospects, they still see some room for appreciation in the stock. Maintaining an Equal-Weight rating suggests that Wells Fargo believes Marriott's stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions.\n\nVulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a company that we have owned several times in the past. The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects. Approximately 99% of Marriott’s global rooms are managed or franchised which enables the company to generate high returns on capital. Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott’s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs. We sold Marriott in the first quarter of 2020 because of our concerns about the company’s debt structure. Since then, Marriott has restructured its debt and improved its balance sheet. Additionally, average daily rates (ADR) on corporate travel have returned to pre-Covid levels.”\n\n08. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)\n\nUpside Potential: 6%\n\nOn March 18, Piper Sandler updated its outlook on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), a leading company in the consulting and professional services industry. They raised the price target on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) from $335 to $394 while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This adjustment reflects Piper Sandler's assessment of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) performance and prospects within the competitive landscape of consulting and professional services. Accenture operates in an industry characterized by providing a wide range of services to businesses worldwide, including strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations. With the increase in price target, Piper Sandler indicates a potential upside of 6% for Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock compared to its current market price of $372.67. This suggests that while Piper Sandler sees some room for appreciation, they remain relatively neutral on Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) outlook.\n\nThe Neutral rating implies that Piper Sandler believes Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) stock is fairly valued relative to its peers and market conditions. This rating takes into consideration various factors, including Accenture's financial performance, competitive position, and growth prospects in the consulting and professional services sector. Piper Sandler expects Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) second-quarter results to meet expectations, with revenue likely to be in-line amid muted market expectations. However, they anticipate the company may adjust the top end of its fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range of 2%-5% due to a potentially slower path to second-half acceleration. Particularly, the consensus for third-quarter growth of +7.4% quarter-over-quarter appears ambitious, according to Piper Sandler. The analysis also highlights historical trends, noting that Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has not experienced a similar level of improvement between the second and third quarters since 2017. Additionally, Piper Sandler underscores the importance of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) commentary on the macroeconomic environment, as industry peers have differing views on the timing of enterprise spend acceleration. This commentary will likely be closely monitored by investors for insights into Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) future performance and industry trends.\n\nClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy stated the following regarding Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n07. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN)\n\nUpside Potential: 10%\n\nOn March 18, BofA Securities provided an updated assessment of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), a prominent player in the electrical equipment industry. Analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and revised the price target upwards from $320 to $325. This adjustment reflects BofA Securities' analysis of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) performance and outlook within the competitive landscape of the electrical equipment sector. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) operates in an industry characterized by providing a diverse range of electrical products and services to various sectors, including industrial, commercial, and residential markets. With the increase in the price target, BofA Securities suggests a potential upside of 10% for Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock compared to its current market price of $298.75. This indicates BofA Securities' optimism about the company's growth prospects and market positioning. The Buy rating signifies BofA Securities' belief that Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) stock offers attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. The increased price target reflects BofA Securities' confidence in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) ability to deliver strong performance and create value for shareholders. By maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target, BofA Securities reaffirms their positive outlook on Eaton Corp and encourages investors to consider the stock as a potential investment opportunity. This endorsement underscores BofA Securities' confidence in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) ability to generate sustained growth and shareholder returns in the dynamic landscape of the electrical equipment sector.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While renewable stocks have come under pressure of late, energy efficiency and decarbonization remain strong drivers for our industrials holdings, where Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) and Trane Technologies (TT) were strong contributors. Eaton, whose electrical equipment enables the electrification of the power grid and electrical vehicle charging infrastructure, is benefiting from tax incentives supporting clean energy, growth in reshoring and expanding manufacturing in North America and the need for grid resiliency amid broad demand for electrification.”\n\n06. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nUpside Potential: 13%\n\nOn March 18, Loop Capital provided an updated analysis of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), a leading player in the streaming entertainment industry. Analyst Alan Gould reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock and adjusted the price target upward from $585 to $700. This update reflects Loop Capital's assessment of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) performance and outlook within the highly competitive streaming entertainment sector. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) operates in an industry characterized by providing digital streaming services for a wide range of entertainment content, including movies, TV shows, and original productions. The company's performance is influenced by factors such as subscriber growth, content acquisition, and competition from other streaming platforms. With the increase in the price target, Loop Capital suggests a potential upside of 13% for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock compared to its current market price of $618.39. This indicates Loop Capital's confidence in the company's growth prospects and market position.\n\nThe Buy rating signifies Loop Capital's belief that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock presents attractive investment opportunities relative to its peers and market conditions. By maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target, Loop Capital reiterates their positive outlook on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and encourages investors to consider the stock as a potential investment opportunity. This endorsement underscores Loop Capital's confidence in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) ability to innovate and capture market share in the evolving landscape of streaming entertainment.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms—both categorized in the communication services sector—rounded out our top five contributors in Q4 as well as for 2023. Both stocks suffered sharp declines in 2022, each losing more than 50% of their market capitalizations. In 2022, we purchased Netflix and added to our position in Meta on weakness as both stocks were selling significantly below our estimates of fair value. Netflix and other media stocks were out of favor due to questions about the long-term economics of streaming, slowing subscriber growth and increasing competition. Meta’s challenges were more self-inflicted as a ramp-up in spending caused free cash flow to plummet. We saw Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth as a normal feature of a maturing streaming market. Despite growth having slowed, Netflix’s position as the largest streaming service with currently close to 250 million subscribers is a key strategic advantage. Streaming is a scale and intellectual property business model that will result in a few large winners. Netflix remains far ahead of all streaming peers in subscribers, revenue, content spend and cash flow generation. Importantly, Netflix has also evolved its business model over the past year, becoming more efficient with its content spending, cracking down on password sharing and introducing a lower cost advertising-supported tier (lowering subscriber churn). These changes have led to robust earnings and free cash flow growth. We did trim our positions in Meta and Netflix to put capital to work in names having greater discounts.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Biggest Solar Companies in the World 16 Sites Like Alibaba: Best Alternatives to Source Products 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US\n\nDisclosure: None.

But it's continuing the overall bullish theme that's been going on since the year started.\"\n\nAt 04:15 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 320.33 points, or 0.83% , to 39,110.76, the S&P 500 gained 29.09 points, or 0.56%, to 5,178.51 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 63.34 points, or 0.39%, to 16,166.79.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average outpaced its Wall Street peers, supported by a 2% gains in Home Depot and advances of more than 1% in both McDonald's and Apple Inc.\n\nIn the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors only communications services lost ground and that ended down just 0.2% after an almost 3% rally on Monday.\n\nEnergy led gains, rising 1.1% as oil prices rose.\n\nInvestors were preparing a day ahead of the Fed's policy update, including a press conference from Chair Jerome Powell. Robust inflation data has pulled back bets for the first rate cut in June to about 59% from about 69% at the start of last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There's optimism that the Fed's not going to surprise us a lot on Wednesday,\" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. \"We think three cuts are still on the table.\"\n\nBut, Goldman still sees Powell reminding the market that he is cautious about inflation and that policy will depend on economic data and expects the central bank to update its inflation and economic growth projections.\n\nAmong other movers, crypto-exchange operator Coinbase Global fell almost 4% while miner Riot Platforms fell almost 3% along with a 5% slide in bitcoin.\n\nMicroStrategy shares fell 5.7% after the company announced it had completed a $603.75 million convertible debt offering - its second in a week - to fund bitcoin purchases.\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer shares tumbled just under 9% after it announced it will sell 2 million shares that could fetch about $2 billion.\n\nSpire Global shares soared 30.4% after it announced a collaboration with Nvidia for AI-driven weather prediction.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.25-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, which showed 286 new highs and 53 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq, 2,517 stocks rose and 1,768 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about a 1.42-to-1 ratio and it recorded 98 new highs and 126 new lows. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and one new low.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 10.74 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.37 billion average for the last 20 sessions.\n\n(Reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Maju Samuel and Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) giant's GTC 2024 conference with a keynote address on Monday in which he unveiled the company's next-generation AI chip that the company hopes will keep Nvidia at the forefront of the AI race.\n\nThe new Blackwell G200 is the successor to its Grace Hopper line of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used in data centers and supercomputers as well as speeding up tasks. Nvidia said the new chip can enable AI models with a trillion parameters while reducing operating costs and energy consumption.\n\nIn a press release, the company said companies like Amazon Web Services, Dell, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI are expected to adopt Blackwell.\n\n\"Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,\" Huang said during his keynote address in which he introduced Blackwell as a new \"very, very big GPU\" that binds two silicon squares that are each the size of its predecessor chip so that they function as a single unit.\n\nNVIDIA UNVEILS ROBOTS POWERED BY SUPER COMPUTER AND AI TO TAKE ON WORLD'S HEAVY INDUSTRIES Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang shows off the new Blackwell AI chip in comparison to its predecessor.\n\nHuang said that Blackwell's design allows it to easily replace its predecessor, the Grace Hopper chip, \"You slide out Hopper, and you push in Blackwell. That's the reason why one of the challenges of ramping is going to be so efficient.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"There are installations of Hoppers all over the world and they could be the same infrastructure, same design, the power, the electricity, the thermals, the software – identical. Push it right back, and so this is a Hopper version for the current SGX configuration,\" Huang explained.\n\nHuang brought out a \"quite expensive\" fully-functioning board to show the audience that featured two Blackwell chips and four Blackwell dyes connected to a Grace CPU that has a \"super fast chip-to-chip link.\"\n\nNVIDIA FACES LAWSUIT FROM AUTHORS OVER ALLEGED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IN AI MODELS\n\nStory continues Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang shows off new AI processors during his keynote address.\n\n\"What's amazing is this computer is the first of its kind where this much computation, first of all, fits into this small of a place. Second, it's memory coherent, so it feels like they're just one big happy family working on one application together. So everything is coherent within it,\" Huang said. \"There's a lot of terabytes this, and terabytes that, but this is a miracle.\"\n\nHuang went on to say that the inference capability of Blackwell is \"off the charts\" and about 30 times Hopper's capability. Generative AI tools use inference to respond to users' queries posed to chatbots or image generation programs.\n\n\"Blackwell is going to be just an amazing system for generative AI. And in the future data centers are going to be thought of, as I mentioned earlier, as an AI factory. An AI factory's goal in life is to generate revenues. Generate, in this case intelligence in this facility, not generating electricity as in AC generators of the last industrial revolution, in this industrial revolution the generation of intelligence,\" Huang said. \"The excitement of Blackwell is really off the charts.\"\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Nvidia's stock has surged about 247% over the last year amid the generative AI boom.\n\nHuang told CNBC that the Blackwell chip will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000 — although he later clarified that he \"wasn't intending on providing a pricing for a chip\" and emphasized that the focus is on designing and integrating into data centers more broadly rather than individual chips.\n\nNvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told the outlet that the company will start shipping Blackwell chips \"later this year\" and noted that there are likely to be supply constraints after its initial launch.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged more than 247% over the last year amid the surge in demand for generative AI tools and the hardware that powers and trains those programs.\n\nThe company's stock was trading near $900 in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, up about 1.7% on the day. Nvidia's stock hit an all-time high of $926.69 on March 7.\n\nOriginal article source:Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announces company's next-gen AI chip",

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Tumbled on Tuesday",
        "content": "After the market close on Monday, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) kicked off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which some have dubbed the \"Woodstock of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\" Thousands of tech glitterati showed up in person to watch CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address, while millions more tuned in online.\n\nDuring the two-hour presentation, Huang expounded on the company's latest creations, collaborations, and partnerships, which will have a ripple effect across much of the tech world. This morning, investors are still digesting the impact of these announcements, which is causing something of a hangover in AI stocks -- likely following the old adage \"buy the rumor, sell the news.\"\n\nWith that as a backdrop, AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) tumbled 10.3%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) slumped 5%, and chip designer Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) declined 2.8% as of 1:26 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- was mixed in terms of company-specific news (more on that in a bit), suggesting much of the move was tied to Nvidia's day in the spotlight. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe unveiling of Blackwell\n\nNvidia announced its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, the successor to the company's highly sought-after Hopper processors, which have become the gold standard for AI processing. Huang called the updated B200 graphics processing unit (GPU) the \"world's most powerful chip\" for AI.\n\nThe GB200 superchip combines two B200 processors and a Grace CPU on a single board. Nvidia also developed a new network switch chip -- the NVLink -- that facilitates speedier communication while reducing the burden on the main processors.\n\nThese next-generation processors are being packaged into full systems, including the GB200 NVL72, which contains 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs in a complete rack-scale design. The liquid-cooled system also contains a 72-GPU NVLink, which \"acts as a single massive GPU,\" delivering 30 times faster performance for the large language models (LLMs) that underlie generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Nvidia's chief rival in the AI chip space, AMD's stock price reaction isn't unexpected, as Nvidia raised the bar for AI performance expectations. Analysts from JPMorgan posit that Nvidia \"continues to be one to two steps ahead of its competitors,\" while analysts at Bank of America suggest Nvidia continues to \"widen its competitive moat.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Grace CPU in Nvidia's GB200 was designed by Arm Holdings, which means the company gets a cut of each sale, either in the form of royalties or licensing revenue.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, commonly referred to as Supermicro, partners with Nvidia on its own rack-scale, AI-centric servers to ensure optimal integration and performance from Nvidia's AI workhorse processors. Supermicro announced the expansion of its product portfolio to include these latest powerhouse AI chips.\n\nIt's easy to see how the ripples from Nvidia's announcements will impact each of these companies in both positive and negative ways.\n\nThere was one piece of company-specific news that may have fueled its downturn Tuesday. In a regulatory filing, Supermicro announced a secondary stock offering, with plans to sell 2 million shares of common stock, bringing the total share count to 58.55 million.\n\nCurrent shareholders are no doubt unhappy about the dilution, which amounts to about 3.5% -- far less than today's stock price drubbing. However, since the stock was recently sitting near an all-time high, it maximizes the amount of capital Supermicro will raise. At its current price of roughly $900 (as of this writing), the company could raise roughly $1.8 billion.\n\nAre any of these stocks a buy?\n\nMost market commentators believe that it's still very early days for the adoption of AI. If they're right -- and I believe they are -- each of these stocks has a vast opportunity ahead. For example:\n\nSupermicro has become the server of choice for many businesses looking to adopt AI. Furthermore, the company's building-block strategy allows companies to start small and easily expand their existing systems as the need arises. Arm Holdings controls a vast library of intellectual property (IP) and will continue to see its licensing and royalty revenue grow from the accelerating adoption of AI. AMD offers alternatives to Nvidia's AI processors, as well as CPUs of its own design to accompany them, so it will also benefit from the secular tailwind represented by AI.\n\nIn terms of valuation, Supermicro is the least expensive of the group, with a forward price-to-sales ratio of 2, while AMD and Arm Holdings are selling for 9 times and 33 times forward sales, respectively.\n\nHowever, for those with a long-term outlook and stomach for some increased volatility, each of these stocks represents an intriguing opportunity, especially since it's still early days for AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "ArcBest is seeking to improve human-robot interactions on the warehouse floor. (Photo: ArcBest)\n\nTransportation and logistics provider ArcBest said it is using technology from Nvidia to “bridge the gap” in human-robot interactions during freight handling.\n\nArcBest (NASDAQ: ARCB) said the use of semiconductor engineer Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) Isaac Perceptor provides enhanced safety and efficiency when handling materials on a warehouse floor. The AI technology provides exact depth perception and improved 3D occupancy mapping as it captures more than 16.5 million 3D points per camera every second.\n\nThe robots can now “better recognize objects, track human motion and make informed decisions that guide its path, for safer, more flexible and more efficient operations,” a news release said.\n\nThe technology is being used with ArcBest’s autonomous stack, Vaux Smart Autonomy, which includes the recent rollout of autonomous forklifts and reach trucks. It replaces 3D lidar sensors, which are less effective and more costly.\n\n“Today’s material handling environment can be incredibly complex, with variability in the facility and products,” said Michael Newcity, chief innovation officer at ArcBest and president of ArcBest Technologies. “Our shift from 3D LiDAR sensors to visual AI technology is part of our continual progress and another step towards addressing these challenges.”\n\nHe said no other robotics company is using the technology in the logistics industry.\n\n“This collaboration with NVIDIA enhances our AI and technology capabilities, which helps us better serve our customers and drive the global supply chain forward,” said Judy McReynolds, chairman, president and CEO at ArcBest.\n\nThe announcement came Monday at Nvidia’s weeklong AI conference in San Jose, California.\n\nMore FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden\n\nCarriers installing solar panels to reduce costs, extend battery life Landstar adds 2 new sales roles to the C-suite Yellow asks court to toss claims it failed to give layoff notifications\n\nThe post ArcBest deploys Nvidia’s AI technology on its autonomous forklifts appeared first on FreightWaves.",

        "title": "Why Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Micron Stocks All Dropped Today",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) Global Technology Conference 2024 (GTC 2024) kicked off on Monday, full of \"sizzle and substance\" (said Bank of America), but also offering \"no big surprises\" (according to Morgan Stanley). Investors who had been hoping for more are selling off Nvidia stock modestly today -- down 2.2% through 11 a.m. ET -- on Tuesday morning. And they're not the only ones selling.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) stock is also down 2.2% today, and Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) off 2.6%. Micron(NASDAQ: MU), which has been bundling its high bandwidth memory chips along with the artificial intelligence (AI) chips that Nvidia is selling, is suffering a 1.5% sell-off, as well.\n\nThere may be two reasons for this.\n\nEverything AI starts with Nvidia\n\nNvidia has turned into the standard bearer and industry leader in AI chips, so let's start there.\n\nAs TheFly.com reports, Nvidia offered up a \"slew of product and partner announcements\" last night and laid out plans for expanding AI's role in services, robotics, and the omniverse (the artist formerly known as the metaverse). What Nvidia didn't do, however -- and what investors apparently were hoping it would do -- is update its assessment of the size of the total addressable market (TAM) for AI chips. That means no new increase in the potential sales of Nvidia chips worldwide -- but also no increase in the TAM for Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, or Micron, either (at least according to Nvidia).\n\nThis is probably the first reason semiconductor stocks are having a bad Tuesday morning. But the second reason may be related.\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona?\n\nIn the cases of Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor, there's a second reason for investors to be concerned. As Nikkei Asia reports today, five suppliers to Intel and TSMC have delayed construction of their own facilities in Arizona, which were intended to support the construction of new semiconductor plants there from Intel and TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuppliers LCY Chemical, Solvay, Chang Chun Group, KPPC Advanced Chemicals, and Topco Scientific are blaming the high cost of construction, labor, and finding workers to build their plants for the postponements -- as well as Intel and TSMC themselves slow-rolling development of their own Arizona plants. TSMC, for example, has postponed the start of mass production at its Arizona plant from 2024 to 2025.\n\nHow bad is this news for Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Company, and Micron? Taken in conjunction with Nvidia's lack of raising its estimate of AI TAM, it sounds a bit concerning for Intel and TSMC. And at least one of the suppliers -- LCY Chemical -- is also a supplier to Micron and its high bandwidth memory chips.\n\nStill, I wouldn't worry too much about today's semiconductor sell-off. For one thing, a $1 trillion TAM for AI chips is still pretty darn large. And as big as Nvidia is, it still sold less than $61 billion in all sorts of chips last year.\n\nPlus, according to Nikkei, it's faster to build chemical supply plants for chipmakers than for the semiconductor manufacturing plants they service. If demand for AI chips grows as expected, and Intel and TSMC get back on schedule building their Arizona plants, the suppliers could still probably finish their own plants in time to supply them before operations commence.\n\nWhile today's news bears watching in case things get worse, I don't see it posing a huge risk to semiconductor stocks over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

Some investors suggested the news was priced into the high-flying stock.\n\nFellow chipmakers such as AMD, Marvell Technology and Intel shed between 1.9% and 4.9%, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index dipped 2.3%.\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer dropped nearly 11.5% after announcing that it will sell 2 million shares that could fetch about $2 billion.\n\nAt 9:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 42.20 points, or 0.11%, at 38,832.63, the S&P 500 was down 11.67 points, or 0.23%, at 5,137.75, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 114.69 points, or 0.71%, at 15,988.76.\n\nFive of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were trading were lower, with information technology down 0.8%.\n\nMost megacap stocks fell in early trading, with Tesla losing 3.2% and Meta Platforms retreating 2.3%.\n\nAll three major stock indexes finished higher in the previous session, with the Nasdaq bouncing back from two successive small weekly losses as growth stocks such as Alphabet and Tesla boosted the tech-heavy index.\n\nFocus will remain on U.S. central bankers who are expected to hold rates steady at the end of their two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nBut, investors are concerned that their new economic projections may be a wild card, potentially signaling fewer interest rate cuts and a later start to the policy easing cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It's all about the dot plot,\" said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede.\n\n\"There's almost no expectation that they're taking rates off the highs but the Fed is going to be taking a hard look at inflation, which for the first two months of the year has been pretty sticky.\"\n\nRobust inflation data has pushed traders to pull back bets of the first rate cut coming in June to 55.2% from 71% at the start of last week, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nAmong other movers, crypto-exchange operator Coinbase Global and miners Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital Holdings shed between 6.4% and 7.7%, tracking the sharp slide in bitcoin.\n\nSpire Global jumped 56.3% after the company announced a collaboration with Nvidia for AI-driven weather prediction.\n\nFusion Pharmaceuticals jumped 97.4% after AstraZeneca said it will buy the Canadian drug developer for $2 billion in cash.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.28-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.04-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 29 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 57 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Maju Samuel)",

        "content": "Let's cut right to the chase: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is on track to become the world's largest company. Think that's going too far? I don't. Here's why.\n\nIt's already the world's third-largest company\n\nAs of this writing, Nvidia has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest American company, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nCompany Name Symbol Market Cap (in billions) Microsoft MSFT $3,094 Apple AAPL $2,665 Nvidia NVDA $2,195 Amazon AMZN $1,811 Alphabet GOOG $1,761\n\nThat puts it 'only' $500 billion behind Apple and about $1 trillion behind Microsoft. To put it another way, Nvidia could surpass Apple if its stock were to rally by 23%; it could pass Microsoft if it rallied by 46%.\n\nWhy Nvidia could top Microsoft and Apple\n\nWhy do I think this will happen? Two words come to mind: Artificial Intelligence (AI). In short, the world has gone head-over-heels for AI. Consider this chart below: Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to Statista, the overall Generative AI market stood at $44.9 billion in 2023. By 2030, that figure is expected to rise to $207 billion. Generative AI, which can create images, stories, music, and video, is already upending entire industries. Marketing, software design, and customer service are just a few sectors likely to be transformed over the next decade as generative AI products grow in popularity.\n\nHow Nvidia will benefit\n\nIn short, Nvidia stands to profit from the AI revolution more than any other company, thanks to its leading share of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) market.\n\nGPUs are the 'brains' behind cutting-edge AI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney. And to build those brains, companies like OpenAI need tens of thousands of GPUs -- often designed by Nvidia.\n\nTo sum up, thanks to its commanding place in the GPU market, I think Nvidia can ride the AI wave to the top of the list of most valuable companies in the world.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +21.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 18.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.45 per share, indicating a change of +400% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $23.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +81.3%. This estimate has changed +16.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.06 indicates a change of +11% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +234%. For the current and next fiscal years, $103.49 billion and $118.77 billion estimates indicate +69.9% and +14.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $22.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +265.3%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.82%. The EPS surprise was +13.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been anything but an under-the-radar stock over the last year. After blowing out sales estimates for three straight quarters, shares of the technology company have soared 265% over the last 12 months.\n\nNvidia is currently the clear leader in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) computing solutions; saying its powerful semiconductors are in high demand is an understatement. And even after the surge in the stock, there are still two good reasons to buy it now.\n\n1. The era of generative AI\n\nNvidia offers a diversified portfolio of products. It makes chips for gaming and offers a cloud-based gaming service. Its omniverse platform helps businesses design and operate manufacturing processes, and the company also supplies the burgeoning autonomous driving industry. But the data center segment is what has investors most excited.\n\nRevenue from that segment grew 409% year over year in the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28). In that quarterly report, CEO Jensen Huang said: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\" As Huang has previously noted, the era of generative AI is clearly taking off.\n\nBut there looks to be plenty more growth to come. The market size for generative AI is projected to more than quadruple from the 2023 level by the end of this decade. Nvidia will be a big beneficiary of that growth. Data source: Statista.\n\n2. The geographical diversity of its business\n\nNvidia isn't just diversified with its products and services, it's also diversified geographically. As the graph below shows, continued sales growth doesn't just rely on the economy of any single country or region. Image source: Statista.\n\nEven though a global recession (or a decline in just one of its major markets) will affect Nvidia's performance, there is less risk for investors when sales are spread out geographically.\n\nThat helps stem some risk, and there are plenty of catalysts for more growth, too. Machine learning has been the major focus of AI development. That is likely to continue for at least several more years, but an increasing number of businesses in multiple sectors are also using AI technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's automotive segment could also grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. Autonomous and sensor technology is just one more area beyond machine learning where its sales could jump in the future. That potential is yet another reason to own the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Is the Cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock, According to Peter Lynch's Favorite Valuation Metric",
        "content": "There's been a lot of talk about the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks recently. These large, competitively advantaged tech platforms have vastly outperformed the market over the past decade, and they also seem like great bets to benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, too.\n\nBut their strong recent run has led many to believe these stocks are either overpriced or fairly priced relative to the rest of the market. On the other hand, many have been saying that for years, only to see these tech giants surpass earnings expectations.\n\nHow to balance their relatively high market valuations with their above-average growth prospects? One valuation metric touted by one of the most famous mutual fund managers of all time may hold the secret.\n\nThe PEG ratio\n\nThe PEG ratio, or price-to-earnings-to-growth metric, was first developed in 1969 by Mario Farina and later popularized by Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s.\n\nTo calculate the PEG ratio, an investor should divide a company's P/E ratio by its expected earnings growth rate. In general, stocks may have a PEG ratio between 1 and 2, with stocks with PEGs under 1 considered undervalued, and stocks above 2 considered overvalued.\n\nA PEG ratio is an imperfect measure, to be sure, as some investors may use either the trailing or forward P/E ratio, and others use different lengths of time to calculate the long-term earnings growth numbers.\n\nOne standard type of PEG ratio is to look at the P/E ratio based on current year expected earnings, and the outlook for the next five years' earnings growth.\n\nMagnificent PEG Ratios\n\nHere's how the PEG ratios the Magnificent Seven stocks shake out.\n\nCompany PEG Ratio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.10 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.36 Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 1.49 Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 1.93 Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 2.11 Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 2.12 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 2.36\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a few expected results here, but also a few surprises. First, it's not surprising to see both Meta and Alphabet among the cheapest of these stocks. These two generally trade at discounts to other \"disruptive\" tech names, perhaps because of their already being large, \"mature\" companies. Moreover, many investors give less credit to revenue and profits that come from advertising, as ad revenue is thought to be economically sensitive and perhaps flighty.\n\nStill, that has been the case for years, and both Alphabet and Meta have generally been able to defy skeptics and continue solid growth over the long term as ad dollars continue to flow to digital ads from traditional advertisements.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet has lots of cash on its balance sheet and generates significant losses from its \"Other Bets\" segment, increasing its P/E ratio relative to its core business and making it look more expensive. And since it's really hard to know whether some of Alphabet's moonshot projects will pay off, analysts probably aren't forecasting any contribution from these loss-making but forward-thinking businesses, perhaps underrating Alphabet's earnings growth prospects even further.\n\nAnd of course, besides a reasonable valuation, Meta's new dividend is a good sign of confidence management has in the sustainability of its earnings. Thus, both of these stocks may be worth looking at if contemplating allocating to Magnificent Seven stocks today.\n\nOne big surprise here is Nvidia, which actually comes out as the second cheapest stock based on this measure. That's despite having the highest trailing P/E ratio at 73.5. That is, of course, because analysts are forecasting robust growth for Nvidia based on its lead in GPUs that currently dominate the artificial intelligence market. From the looks of it, it appears analysts believe that advantage will continue, and that the AI revolution will deliver sustainable high growth for Nvidia over the immediate term. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAre the bottom four worth considering?\n\nTesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are all near 2 or above in terms of their PEG ratios, making them generally unattractive on this metric.\n\nHowever, that doesn't necessarily mean one should avoid these stocks. Remember, the PEG ratio is just one indication, based on future earnings growth that is somewhat unknowable.\n\nMoreover, each of these companies have slightly different reasons for their high PEG ratios. Both Microsoft and Apple are generally given high valuations, not necessarily because of growth, but rather because of the stability of their businesses and the confidence that earnings will generally remain intact for a long time. Apple obviously has among the best consumer franchises in the world with the iPhone, making it not only a tech stock but more of a consumer staple. And consumer staples stocks generally trade at higher valuations despite lower growth, because of their perceived \"safety\" in good economic environments and bad.\n\nMicrosoft is also regarded as a very safe stock, because of its dominance of not one but several high-profit businesses, including the Windows operating system, the Office enterprise software suite, and its Azure cloud computing platform. Add in its exclusive arrangement with OpenAI, and it's perhaps no wonder Microsoft is given a high valuation that may be deserved.\n\nOn the other hand, the high PEGs for Amazon and Tesla probably have to do with their high multiples today and the substantial uncertainty to their future earnings.\n\nAmazon has typically spent all or most of its profit on future innovation, so its bottom line is incredibly difficult to project, even if the company generally does well. It's likely that Wall Street analysts aren't projecting much profit inflection, as is the case for Alphabet's \"other bets,\" since Amazon hasn't really ever harvested profit in a significant way.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is a pioneer in the emerging electric vehicle market, which has high growth expectations over the long term. However, that market has slowed in recent months amid high interest rates, and Tesla's earnings are actually currently declining as it cuts prices.\n\nThe combination of high long-term growth expectations in the face of a likely earnings decline this year means Tesla is quite risky. In fact, I would personally own Amazon over Tesla, despite the slightly higher PEG, since I think Amazon is more likely to see profit inflect upward relative to current analyst expectations than Tesla.\n\nDon't just use the PEG\n\nThe PEG ratio can be useful in offering a very quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its growth. However, one factor the PEG ratio doesn't capture very well is a business' safety compared with other stocks. P/E ratios are a reflection of both growth expectations and risk, but risk is a very squishy and difficult concept to quantify.\n\nMoreover, the greatest stock gains usually come from businesses that wildly outperform expectations, so using a metric that merely reflects expectations is also a limiting factor. That's why the PEG ratio is best used for companies with stable earnings growth, and not a bottom line that may bounce around year to year such as Amazon or Tesla.\n\nOverall, the PEG ratio is just one shortcut for investors. But remember, a company's intrinsic value is always the present value of future cash flows. If you come across a company that looks cheap based on a PEG ratio, see if you can dig deeper and map out what you think cash flow can do over the next decade, as well as the probability that your projected scenario will unfold.\n\nWhile the PEG ratio is a useful shortcut, remember that it's more a starting point than a destination.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "If You Invested $1,000 in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia for Its IPO in 1999, Here's the Jaw-Dropping Amount of Money You'd Have Now",
        "content": "Over the long run, Wall Street is a bona fide wealth-creating machine. Although gold, oil, housing, and Treasury bonds have increased in value over multiple decades, no asset class has come close to replicating the average annual returns delivered by stocks over the past century.\n\nFor example, including dividends paid, the benchmark S&P 500 has delivered just a hair north of a 10% annualized return since its official inception as a 500-company index in 1957. That's a hearty return that can double investors' money about every seven years.\n\nBut on an aggregate growth basis, the S&P 500 doesn't hold a candle to what semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has done for investors since becoming a publicly traded company in 1999. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIf you purchased $1,000 of Nvidia stock at its IPO price, you're now rich\n\nNot too long before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Nvidia made its grand entrance as a publicly traded company. Its initial public offering (IPO) occurred on Jan. 22, 1999, with shares being sold at $12. Of course, a lot has changed since then.\n\nIf investors had the wherewithal to purchase $1,000 worth of Nvidia stock for its IPO, they would have received 83 shares, not including commission costs and fractional shares. In the quarter of a century since going public, this Wall Street darling has split its stock on five separate occasions. The figure in parenthesis behind each split denotes what the original 83-share position would have grown into:\n\nJune 27, 2000: 2-for-1 stock split (166 shares) Sept. 12, 2001: 2-for-1 stock split (332 shares) April 7, 2006: 2-for-1 stock split (664 shares) Sept. 11, 2007: 3-for-2 stock split (996 shares) July 20, 2021: 4-for-1 stock split (3,984 shares)\n\nIPO-day investors have seen their share count in Nvidia grow by a factor of 48. At the same time, the IPO offering price has been reduced to a split-adjusted $0.25 per share.\n\nBased on Nvidia's closing price of $878.36 on March 15, 2024, a 3,984-share position would equate to $3,499,386. For those of you keeping score at home, Nvidia has produced a 351,244% gain since its IPO, which compares to just a 318% return for the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. Keep in mind that I'm not including the additional returns from Nvidia's nominal dividend in this 351,244% figure, either.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what's made Nvidia the stock of the century (thus far)\n\nThroughout its 25 years as a public company, Nvidia has had moments where it's thrived. For quite some time, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for gaming on personal computers were its calling-card to success. The company also gained momentum from 2016 through 2018 as cryptocurrency prices soared. Cryptocurrency miners gobbled up the company's high-powered GPUs.\n\nBut there's little question that Nvidia's role as the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement has done most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThough estimates vary wildly, the analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Utilizing software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be assigned to humans, and seeing these systems evolve over time and become smarter, is what gives AI application across virtually every sector and industry.\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are nothing short of the standard in AI-accelerated data centers. With demand easily outweighing the supply of these high-powered chips, Nvidia has enjoyed otherworldly pricing power, which more than double its sales in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January).\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's ramp of A100 and H100 chips looks to be in its early innings. Its four largest customers -- and fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, have been aggressively gobbling up supply for their own AI-fueled ambitions.\n\nHowever, sustaining this success in the years to come could prove challenging. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's epic outperformance may come to a screeching halt\n\nFor the past year, Nvidia has blown the doors off of Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts. But don't expect this to continue for much longer.\n\nOne problem Nvidia may be contending with in the second-half of 2024, if not well beyond, is margin contraction. The scarcity of the company's AI-GPUs is what's lifted prices for these chips into the stratosphere. With supply chain issues beginning to ease and external competitors entering the arena, AI-focused GPUs will be far less scarce in the second-half of 2024 than they are now. That's a recipe for weaker pricing power and lower margins for Nvidia.\n\nWhat's arguably an even bigger concern for Nvidia than the external competitors that'll be challenging its AI-accelerated data center dominance is that its aforementioned top four customers, which account for 40% of its sales, are developing AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed GPUs are to complement Nvidia's chips or replace them, we're very likely witnessing a peak of orders that will taper into subsequent years.\n\nNvidia is also getting no help from U.S. regulators. Following an initial round of export restrictions to China for its top-notch A100 and H100 GPUs, the company developed the toned-down A800 and H800 chips. Late last year, U.S. regulators axed the shipment of these GPUs to China as well. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in potential quarterly sales because of these restrictions.\n\nThe final damning factor for Nvidia, aside from its lofty valuation, is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble, without exception. Investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption/demand of new innovations or trends, leading to bubbles. It's highly unlikely that Nvidia/AI is going to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nAlthough Nvidia has made patient investors richer, locking in some of those gains would likely be a wise decision.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Has 40% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst. Is the Stock a Buy Near Its All-Time High?",
        "content": "There's little question that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the standard bearer for the possibilities resulting from recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's cutting-edge processors are the gold standard for use with AI models, which has supercharged its stock and helped it surge more than 500% since the start of 2023.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst believes there's still much more stock price appreciation to come.\n\nNvidia is profiting from the AI gold rush\n\nAnalysts at Truist Financial raised their price target on Nvidia to $1,177 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. That represents a potential gain of 33% over the next 12 months or so compared to the stock price when the market closed on Monday. The Truist analyst said investors are underestimating Nvidia's leading position in parallel computing and AI.\n\nThe analyst goes even further, calling Nvidia \"the AI company,\" citing its ongoing investment and its \"culture of innovation\" as strategic advantages.\n\nA strategic advantage for Nvidia\n\nIt's hard to find fault with the analysts' position. When Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), the company spent a record $2.46 billion on research and development (R&D), capping off a year in which the company spent $8.68 billion on R&D -- also a record.\n\nMuch has been made about the looming competition as rivals scramble to develop a better, faster, more robust AI processor. However, Nvidia has a long track record of staying ahead of the competition, and -- thanks to its ongoing heavy spending on R&D -- that's unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is currently selling for 74 times trailing 12-month earnings. Wall Street expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share (EPS) of $24.46 in 2025 and $29.82 by 2026. If the analyst's price target is accurate, that would shrink the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 48 next year and 39 the year after, which suggests Nvidia stock is a bargain at its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those reasons and more, Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the cryptocurrency industry, head directly to 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant turnaround from the losses of 2022 and 2023, with a notable rise driven by Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price has been steadily climbing since October 2023 and is currently approaching its previous record levels from late 2021. The surge in prices suggests that the cryptocurrency market may be on track to set new records this year. The key question now is whether this trend signifies a sustained bull market in cryptocurrencies or a short-lived surge. This upward trend follows a surge of interest from retail investors in spot Bitcoin ETFs. For instance, on March 4 alone, net inflows into the US-based Bitcoin ETFs reached approximately $562 million, as reported by Cointelegraph.\n\nThe rising popularity of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum is anticipated to drive market growth in the coming years. People in developed nations are increasingly embracing the convenient and flexible nature of digital transactions offered by these currencies. This surge in virtual currency usage has prompted central banks to show support for digital currencies. Additionally, digital currencies often leverage blockchain technology to achieve decentralization and facilitate efficient transactions, which are fast, transparent, secure, and reliable. Companies are capitalizing on these advantages by investing in cryptocurrency and forming partnerships to enhance services for users. For example, in October 2018, the Qtum Chain Foundation, based in Singapore, collaborated with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Amazon Web Services China to deploy blockchain systems on the Amazon Web Services cloud. This strategic partnership aimed to simplify the development and deployment of smart contracts for AWS users using Amazon Machine Images.\n\nStory continues\n\nA recent report suggests that Bitcoin may hit a new record of $88,000 in 2024, settling at around $77,000 by year-end. Finder, a UK fintech firm, conducted a study based on predictions from 40 crypto industry specialists. The experts anticipate an average peak price of $87,875 in 2024, with some predicting it could reach $200,000. Conversely, the lowest expected price by the end of 2024 is around $35,734, with a few forecasts of as low as $20,000. Over half of the surveyed experts expect prices to rise after a \"BTC halving event\" in April 2024, where the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions is halved. This reward could decrease to 3.125, leading to a decrease in supply and potentially higher prices.\n\nSome experts believe Bitcoin faces pressure due to the halving event and increasing interest from major companies and institutional investors, which could drive up demand. The approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to bring more buyers into the market, as it makes trading Bitcoin-related investment funds easier on US stock exchanges. Additionally, analysts anticipate that a cut in the historically high benchmark rate by the US Federal Reserve could lead to more liquidity flowing into Bitcoin, further boosting its price. However, John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, remains cautious, viewing cryptocurrency as primarily speculative in nature. He stated:\n\n“If the new spot Bitcoin ETFs are popular, there could be a temporary price increase. But, in the medium to longer-term, I still regard Bitcoin as a speculative bubble.”\n\nOn the other hand, the global blockchain market was valued at about $7.4 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach over $94 billion by the end of 2027, with a projected compound annual growth rate of approximately 66.2% during the period from 2022 to 2027. Increased demand for blockchain technology across sectors such as retail, banking, and supply chain is anticipated to drive market expansion. However, the limited availability of skilled professionals to implement blockchain technology could pose a challenge to market growth.\n\nThis article discusses some of the best performing blockchain and bitcoin ETFs that provide investors with access to stocks like Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super- computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. During the period, shares contributed to performance as Nvidia reported solid fiscal third quarter results well above analyst expectations, driven by strong demand from data centers. Growing Al data center workloads are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.”\n\n13.

(NASDAQ:COIN) climbed an incredible 131.7% in the quarter outpacing the 57% gain in bitcoin over the same period as investors became excited about the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the new year. Coinbase continues to stand out as the lead survivor in an industry of fading and failing leaders. Cost savings initiatives taken earlier in the year have resulted in three quarters of positive EBITDA leading to expectations for “meaningful positive adjusted EBITDA” for the full year 2023. We continue to believe COIN has the potential to be the platform for crypto with $5B in liquidity providing the ability to invest and weather any crypto winters.”\n\n12.

        "title": "Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Bank of Japan ups key rate for 1st time in 17 years",
        "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — Shares were mixed in Asia on Tuesday after the Bank of Japan hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time in 17 years, ending a longstanding negative rate policy at odds with the stances of most central banks.\n\nIn a widely anticipated move, the BOJ raised its overnight call rate to a range of 0 to 0.1%, up from minus 0.1%.\n\nIt said that wage increases and other indicators suggested that inflation had stabilized above the BOJ's 2% target, but noted “extremely high uncertainties,” including weakness in industrial production, exports, housing investment and government spending.\n\nMarket reaction was muted.\n\nTokyo’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.7% to 40,003.60, while the dollar rose to 150.35 Japanese yen from 149.14 yen.\n\nChinese markets declined. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.2% to 16,526.98, while the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.7% to 3,064.56.\n\nIn Seoul, the Kospi fell 1.1% to 2,656.17.\n\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4% to 7,703.20 after Australia’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.35% for a third consecutive meeting. The widely expected decision reflected the fact that inflation is cooling but still above the Reserve Bank of Australia's target.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. stocks rose ahead of a busy week for central banks around the world.\n\nThis week's highlight for Wall Street will likely be the Federal Reserve’s meeting on interest rates, which ends on Wednesday. The widespread expectation is for the central bank to hold its main interest rate steady at its highest level since 2001.\n\nBut Fed officials will also give updated forecasts for where they see interest rates heading this year and in the long run. They earlier had penciled in three cuts to rates this year, which would relieve pressure on the economy and financial system.\n\nRecent reports on inflation have consistently been coming in worse than expected, though. That could force the Fed to trim how many rate cuts it foresees delivering this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch a move would be a sore disappointment for investors.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the Bank of England will announce its latest decision on interest rates later in the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 added 0.6% on Monday to 5,149.42, coming off its first back-to-back weekly losses since October.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 38,790.43, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8% to 16,103.45. Smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index slipped 0.7%.\n\nOn Wall Street, Nvidia rose 0.7% after paring an earlier, bigger gain as it kicked off its annual conference for developers.\n\nA frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology on Wall Street has sent the stocks of Nvidia and other players zooming so high that critics call it a bubble. Nvidia has grown into the U.S. stock market’s third-largest stock.\n\nOther Big Tech stocks also pushed the S&P 500 upward to snap a three-day losing streak, its longest in more than two months. Alphabet rallied 4.6%, and Tesla jumped 6.3% to trim its loss for the year so far.\n\nOn the losing end was Hertz Global Holdings, which skidded 6.2% to bring its loss for the year so far to 31.6%. Its chair and CEO, Stephen Scherr, will resign at the end of March. The company named Wayne “Gil” West as its CEO. He’s a former executive at Cruise, the self-driving car company, and at Delta Air Lines.\n\nBoeing sank another 1.5% to bring its loss for the year to 31%. It's been struggling with concerns about its manufacturing quality, and its latest negative headline came on Friday. Workers found a panel missing on an older Boeing 737-800 after it arrived at its destination in southern Oregon from San Francisco.\n\nIn other trading early Tuesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 21 cents to $81.95 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 23 cents to $86.55 per barrel.\n\nThe euro slipped to $1.0869 from $1.0872.",

        "title": "Diversified Stock Portfolio: 11 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 sector ETFs and International ETFs. If you want to see our discussion on the US and international economies, head directly to Diversified Stock Portfolio: 5 Sector ETFs and International ETFs To Buy.\n\nIn the beginning of 2023, investors were cautiously optimistic about inflation cooling down and anticipated interest rate cuts, while also keeping an eye out for signs of an economic recession and lower corporate earnings. However, the economy outperformed these expectations, driven by higher-than-expected consumer savings, increased fiscal spending, and looser financial conditions. This led to a 25% increase in the S&P 500 Index in 2023, bringing the benchmark close to its record high from January 2022. The enthusiastic market rally at the end of 2023 has resulted in overvalued stocks, particularly as investors were encouraged by the Federal Reserve's indication in December that rate cuts could be imminent.\n\nLooking ahead, Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee suggests that investors should adopt a more cautious approach, as 2024 is more likely to be an average year for markets rather than another year of double-digit growth. Analysts are predicting 2024 US corporate earnings to be around $242 per share, assuming that companies will continue to expand their profit margins. However, this estimate may be overly optimistic, considering that US economic growth is expected to taper off from last year's rapid pace of about 7% to around 4% this year. This slowdown could lead to a decrease in sales volume and pricing power for companies. Additionally, corporations may have already realized the benefits of lower manufacturing costs and declining oil and raw material prices, which may not contribute as significantly to improved margins in the future. Morgan Stanley believes that 2024 should be a time for balance, both for investors' expectations and their portfolios.\n\nLooking at the international landscape, economists predict that the European economy is poised for a year of transition after a turbulent 2023, with key challenges like high inflation and increasing interest rates expected to diminish. CNBCnoted that despite the challenging economic conditions in the Eurozone, the pan-European Stoxx 600 stock index ended the year 12.6% higher, driven by optimism about potential monetary policy changes in 2024 by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Stock markets in Europe and globally have started 2024 on a more uncertain note, awaiting new data and signals from central banks. Global markets saw a rally in the final months of 2023, as bond yields retreated on hopes that the Fed and ECB would start cutting interest rates early in 2024. However, the ECB has not yet indicated any immediate easing of policy, despite market expectations for a rate cut in March. Jari Stehn, Chief European Economist at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“While wage growth is still firm and the labour market remains resilient, we expect both to soften in 2024 and look for core inflation to reach 2% year-on-year in [the fourth quarter of 2024], much earlier than projected by the ECB. As a result, we see earlier and faster policy rate cuts than implied by the Governing Council’s recent communication.”\n\nMoreover, the Chinese economy in 2023 faced challenges as it emerged from COVID lockdown. Initially, there was a surge in business activity, especially in the services sector. However, this boost was short-lived, and the property market's troubles intensified. The distress faced by Country Garden Services Holdings Company Limited, one of China's major private developers, had a ripple effect, shaking business and investor confidence. The property market woes spilled over into consumer sentiment and strained local government finances. To address these issues, policymakers took steps such as policy rate cuts and fiscal support. These measures helped soften the economic impact but did not lead to a significant uptick in economic activity. As we enter 2024, there are known challenges ahead, but uncertainty remains about the future. While policymakers have outlined their goals and plans, there are doubts about how these will be implemented and their effectiveness.\n\nIn South Asia, India's $4 trillion stock market is attracting significant investments from both domestic and foreign investors, positioning itself as a rapidly growing alternative to China. Despite concerns about overpriced shares, upcoming elections, and regulatory uncertainties, investors are showing confidence in India's market potential. The NSE Nifty 50 Index has surged by a third in the past months, with foreign inflows reaching $20 billion in 2023, according to India's national depository data. In 2024, India's appeal is increasing as global investors seek alternatives to Chinese markets. There is also growing anticipation that the national elections this year will result in Prime Minister Narendra Modi securing a third term, further bolstering investor confidence in India's economic prospects.\n\nSimilarly, the Japanese stock market had a remarkable 2023, with the Nikkei 225 Index posting its fastest gain in a decade, reaching its highest level since the end of Japan's bubble economy in 1989. The Tokyo Stock Price Index also saw a rise, marking its fourth-best annual performance since 2001 by mid-November 2023 in local currency terms. As perForbes, the positive trend in Japanese equities is expected to continue in 2024, supported by favorable market conditions and regulatory environment, along with backing from influential investors. Despite global challenges such as high interest rates, sluggish economic growth, and persistent inflation, major institutional investors like BlackRock remain optimistic about Japan's prospects. BlackRock announced in September 2023 that it would increase its investment in the world's second-largest economy. The BlackRock Institute stated:\n\n“We turn even more positive on Japanese equities, going overweight due to strong earnings, share buy backs and other shareholder-friendly corporate reforms.”\n\nThis article discusses some of the best performing sector and international ETFs that provide investors with access to stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and ATI Inc.

SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 44.02%\n\nThe SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ) aims to mirror the total return performance of the EURO STOXX 50 Index, which represents some of the largest companies in the 20 EURO STOXX Supersector Indexes. Launched on October 15, 2002, the ETF has assets under management totaling $3.28 billion as of March 14, 2024, with its portfolio comprising 50 stocks. The fund has a gross expense ratio of 0.29% as of March 17, 2024.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is the top holding of the SPDR EURO STOXX 50 ETF (NYSE:FEZ).

(NASDAQ:ASML), up from 57 funds in the preceding quarter.

(NYSE:ATI), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best stocks to add to your stock portfolio.\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\n10. BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (NYSE:BKIE)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 46.57%\n\nThe BNY Mellon International Equity ETF (NYSE:BKIE) aims to mirror the performance of the Solactive GBS Developed Markets ex United States Large & Mid Cap Index NTR. It offers investors exposure to global stocks through a passively managed, low-cost index strategy with full portfolio transparency, making it a good pick for investors’ stock portfolio. Launched on April 22, 2020, the fund has amassed net assets amounting to $616.37 million as of March 15, 2024, with an expense ratio of 0.04%.

On March 7, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)'s stock reached a record peak, with shares climbing as much as 7.5% following positive outcomes from an initial clinical study of its new oral weight-loss medication, Amycretin.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), compared to 51 funds in the previous quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 14.13 million shares worth $1.46 billion.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“As we discussed in last quarter’s commentary, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.”\n\n9.

We exited this multi-year investment as its price went above our appraisal. In 1Q23, GE spun out GE Healthcare, which we sold as it traded at our value. The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.”\n\n7.

Though we do not currently own it in the Portfolio, Taiwan Semiconductor was one of the larger relative detractors from performance during the quarter due to its strong performance and comparatively greater index weight.”\n\n6. iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 15: 79.11%\n\nThe iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (BATS:IEO) aims to reflect the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index, which consists of US stocks in the oil and gas exploration and production sector.

The company has an extensive resource base of high-quality drilling inventory in the U.S. and various international locations as well as a growing liquified natural gas business. In our view, the depth and quality of ConocoPhillips’s inventory is a competitive differentiator that is not fully captured in today’s share price. Over the next 10 years, we believe ConocoPhillips will be able to return more than 100% of its current market cap to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases while growing its production at a mid-single-digit annual pace. We believe ConocoPhillips is also among the best managed companies in the oil and gas industry and we are impressed by its history of accretive capital allocation under CEO Ryan Lance.

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee\n\n(Reuters) - The fervor around artificial intelligence has sparked a gold rush into AI-themed ETFs, as investors seek fresh ways to play the burgeoning technology following breathtaking rallies in market darlings such as Nvidia.\n\nThe funds run the gamut from those offering a bouquet of the biggest AI winners to more esoteric themes such as robotics and sound generation. All told, the universe of AI-themed ETFs traded in the United States has soared to $6.88 billion as of the end of February from $2.55 billion a year earlier, Morningstar data showed.\n\n\"It's still so early in the evolution of this category ... that investors are still sorting through the possibilities,\" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe exuberance surrounding AI funds echoes previous waves of investor excitement for other technologies viewed as transformative, from dotcom stocks to electric vehicles.\n\nEach wave introduced major new businesses to the economy and generated astonishing wealth for founders like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as well as ordinary investors. At the same time, many of the companies whose shares soared in previous market booms eventually saw their stock prices fizzle, a fate that may await some of the market’s current AI favorites.\n\nFor now, investors are responding with enthusiasm and Nvidia - whose chips are seen as the gold standard in AI - continues to grab the spotlight.\n\nThe assets of the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which seeks to deliver twice the daily return of the chipmaker’s shares and is not included in Morningstar’s data on AI-themed funds, doubled to $2 billion earlier this month. Those flows have followed the nearly 80% climb in Nvidia's shares so far this year, after the company's shares tripled in 2023.\n\nAt its developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled the Blackwell B200, an AI chip it says is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip.\n\nSmaller ETFs have also prospered. Assets in the Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF tripled to about $20 million from $7.5 million earlier this month, said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeven of the 18 diversified AI-related ETFs that Morningstar tracks have launched within the last three years. An eighth was redesigned to target AI more directly.\n\nThe funds have had collective inflows of $2.68 billion in the last 12 months, according to Morningstar. That is almost double the inflows into global real estate ETFs, the company said.\n\nWhether investor excitement about the possibilities of AI is fueling a bubble or just contributing to a strong bull run in stocks is unclear.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up nearly 8% year-to-date, fueled in part by rallies in AI beneficiaries such as Nvidia and Microsoft, following a 24% gain last year. The AI fervor has also driven parabolic moves in the shares of other companies, including a more than 250% gain in Super Micro Computer, which joined the S&P 500 this week.\n\nSome investors appear to be limiting their exposure to Nvidia and other stocks that have notched big moves. ETF issuer Global X found that its Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, which caps Nvidia exposure to 3%, has tripled in size over the last three months.\n\nBy comparison, its Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, which has more than 20% of its assets invested in the chipmaker, grew by 20%.\n\nOthers are focused on finding new areas that will benefit from AI, said Rene Reyna, head of thematic ETF strategy at Invesco and manager of the Invesco AI and Next Gen Software ETF .\n\n“The conversations we have with investors don’t focus on finding the next Nvidia, but more on recognizing that these technologies are changing the landscape and finding ways to get exposure to some of this growth,” he said.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley last week published a list of 480 individual stocks that may benefit from AI. Less obvious beneficiaries included Walmart and Caterpillar. The bank also recommended exploring \"less crowded sub-themes\" like the integration of AI and smartphones.\n\nETFs are also scrambling to provide offerings for every taste. Robo Global Robotics & Automation ETF supplements its Nvidia exposure with holdings in stocks some expect to benefit from AI technology, like Intuitive Surgical. The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is focusing on companies it expects to be beneficiaries of generative AI, including Salesforce.com and Marvell Technology.\n\nStill, at least one flavor of AI-themed ETF has failed to win fans. The WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value ETF, which uses AI to select its portfolio, has seen outflows of $48.26 million in the last 12 months and lags the S&P 500.\n\nOne possible reason the fund and others in its category have underperformed: many of them lack a position in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Hynix Inc said on Tuesday it has begun mass production of next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence chipsets, with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month.\n\nThe new type of chip - called the HBM3E - is a focal point of intense competition. Last month, Micron Technology said it had started mass production of the chips while Samsung Electronics said it had developed the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E chips.\n\nSK Hynix has, however, led the HBM chip market by virtue of being the sole supplier of the version currently used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia which has 80% of the market for AI chips.\n\n\"The company expects successful mass production of HBM3E and with our experience... as the industry's first provider of HBM3, we expect to cement our leadership in the AI memory space,\" SK Hynix said in a statement.\n\nThe new HBM3E chip by the world's second-largest memory chipmaker offers 10% improvement in heat dissipation and processes up to 1.18 terabytes of data per second.\n\nSK Hynix's HBM capacity is fully booked for 2024, analysts said, as explosive demand for AI chipsets drives up demand for high-end memory chips used in them.\n\n\"SK Hynix has secured an absolute market position... and its volume increase in high-end memory chips is also expected to be the most aggressive among chipmakers,\" said Kim Un-ho, analyst at IBK Investment & Securities.\n\nNvidia unveiled on Monday its latest flagship AI chip, the B200, said to be 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry.\n\nShares in SK Hynix have doubled in value over the past 12 months on its leading position in HBM chips.\n\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

        "content": "By Kevin Buckland\n\nTOKYO, March 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average slid on Tuesday ahead of a pivotal Bank of Japan policy decision, with investors braced for an end to eight years of radical monetary stimulus.\n\nMany semiconductor-related shares had outsized losses, after Nvidia's annual developer conference failed to provide fresh momentum for the global artificial intelligence-centred chip stock rally.\n\nEnergy shares were the top performers, after a 2% jump in crude oil prices overnight.\n\nThe Nikkei slipped 0.8% to 39,429,73, as of 0130 GMT, giving up some of Monday's 2.7% surge, when investors cheered media reports offering further insight on what BOJ policymakers would do on Tuesday.\n\nThe broader Topix eased 0.2%, with a sub-index of growth shares down 0.5%, while value stocks were flat.\n\n\"With every media outlet basically reporting an end to negative rates, yield curve control and ETF buying - what you could call the full set of three - the market has already completely priced in this outcome,\" said Kazuo Kamitani, an equities strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nHe said the updated dot plot when the U.S. Federal Reserve's own policy meeting ends on Wednesday would be a near-term \"focal point.\" Japanese markets are closed for a national holiday that day.\n\nThere is no set time for the BOJ's policy announcement, but it has recently come around the time stock markets reopen from the midday recess at 0330 GMT.\n\nTop BOJ officials, including Governor Kazuo Ueda, have stressed that bond purchases would continue even if yield curve control is ended, and that the central bank will not engage in successive hikes after exiting negative rates.\n\nChip-testing equipment maker Advantest, which counts Nvidia among its customers, was among the Nikkei's worst performers on Tuesday, slumping 2.5%.\n\nAI-focused startup investor SoftBank Group dropped 0.7%.\n\nThe biggest drag on the Nikkei was Uniqlo store operator Fast Retailing due to its particularly heavy weighting in the index. Shares of Fast Retailing slid 1.8%.\n\nInpex was the Nikkei's top performing energy stock, gaining 2.3%. Among top sectors, miners - which includes oil explorers - gained 2.2%, while oil and coal producers rose 1.2%. (Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)",

        "content": "By Anna Tong and Stephen Nellis\n\nSAN JOSE (Reuters) - Nvidia on Monday unveiled software aimed at making it easier for businesses to incorporate artificial intelligence systems into their work, broadening the chipmaker's offerings.\n\nThe release highlights Nvidia's push to expand its presence in the AI application execution sector, called inference, where the company's chips don't dominate the market, said Joel Hellermark, CEO of Sana, a maker of AI assistants for companies.\n\nNvidia is best known for providing the chips used to train so-called foundation models like OpenAI's GPT-4. Training involves ingesting large amounts of data and is done mostly by AI-focused and large tech companies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, companies of all sizes are scrambling to incorporate those foundation models into their work, which can be complicated. The Nvidia tools released on Monday are designed to make it easier to modify and run various AI models on Nvidia hardware.\n\n\"It's like buying a ready-made meal rather than going out and purchasing ingredients yourself,\" said Ben Metcalfe, a venture capitalist who founded Monochrome Capital.\n\n\"The Googles and Doordashes and Ubers, they can do all of this themselves, but now that Nvidia has more GPUs available they need to enable more companies to get value out of GPUs,\" he said. Those less tech-savvy companies can use the \"prepared recipes\" to get their systems up, he said.\n\nFor example, ServiceNow, a firm that provides software for use by technical support staff inside big businesses, said it used Nvidia's tools to create a \"copilot\" to help solve corporate IT problems.\n\nNvidia has some big-name partners for the new tools: Microsoft, Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon will offer them as part of their cloud computing services, and Google, Cohere, Meta and Mistral are among companies offering models. But OpenAI, its financial backer Microsoft and Anthropic, two of the largest providers of foundation models, are notably missing from the list.\n\nNvidia's tools offer a potential revenue boost for the chipmaker: They are part of its existing software suite that costs $4,500 a year for each Nvidia chip if used on in a private data center or $1 per hour in a cloud data center.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Jose and Anna Tong in San Francisco; editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler)",

        "content": "Nvidia unveiled Monday that it is planning to release a software and hardware platform that can be used to build human-like robots which will continue to learn through generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe platform is made up of a computer system to power the robot and AI, along with a suite of software that includes various tools like genAI, to build human-like robots.\n\nNvidia made the announcement during its annual developer conference, where it touted the abilities genAI will provide for the robots.\n\nJim Fan a research manager and lead of embodied AI at Nvidia posted to X that through GR00T, robots will be able to understand instructions through language, video and demonstrations to perform a variety of tasks.\n\nUS-FUNDED REPORT ISSUES URGENT AI WARNING OF ‘UNCONTROLLABLE’SYSTEMS TURNING ON HUMANS\n\n\"We are collaborating with many leading humanoid companies around the world, so that GR00T may transfer across embodiments and help the ecosystem thrive,\" Fan said.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nHe also said Project GR00T is a \"cornerstone\" of the \"Foundation Agent\" roadmap for the GEAR Lab. Fan said at GEAR, the team is building robots that learn to act skillfully in many worlds, both virtual and real. He also provided a video in the post showing team members working with robots.\n\n\"These smarter, faster, better robots will be deployed in the world's heavy industries,\" Rev Lebaredian, Vice President, Omniverse and Simulation Technology, told reporters. \"We are working with the world's entire robot and simulation ecosystem to accelerate development and adoption.\"\n\nNvidia’s \"Jetson Thor\" is the computer behind the genAI software, while the package of software is called the \"Isaac\" platform.\n\n\"Jetson Thor\" will provide enough horsepower for the robot to be able to compute and perform complex tasks, the company noted, while also allowing the robot to interact with other machines and people.\n\nStory continues\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Tech leaders who spoke with Fox News Digital said bias in artificial intelligence can have an immense impacts on society.\n\n\"Isaac\" and the new GR00T features will enable \"any robot embodiment in any environment,\" Nvidia added.\n\nOver time, the tools will train the software to improve its decision-making through reinforcement learning.\n\nAlong with the software and hardware platform, Nvidia announced it would be releasing pre-trained robotics models and additional software to improve camera sensing abilities and robotic arm functions.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive in as little as five years.\n\nNVIDIA CEO JENSEN HUANG SAYS AI COULD PASS MOST HUMAN TESTS IN 5 YEARS Digital illustration of a humanoid robot.\n\nThe company’s artificial intelligence chips are being used to create systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and Huang said AGI’s arrival depends largely on how the goal of AGI is defined.\n\n\"If I gave an AI… every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years’ time, we'll do well on every single one,\" Huang said.\n\nAI can currently pass tests like legal bar exams but has struggled on specialized medical tests like gastroenterology.\n\nNVIDIA CEO IS $9.6B RICHER AS AI CHIPMAKER'S STOCK SOARS Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA holding the Grace hopper superchip CPU used for generative AI at supermicro keynote presentation during the COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers.\n\nBut how fast AI can develop and learn has many people concerned about robots taking over the world.\n\nThe U.S. government commissioned a report that came out earlier this month, saying there is a \"clear and urgent need\" to act, as swiftly developing artificial intelligence could potentially lead to human extinction through weaponization and loss of control.\n\n\"Given the growing risk to national security posed by rapidly expanding AI capabilities from weaponization and loss of control — and particularly, the fact that the ongoing proliferation of these capabilities serves to amplify both risks — there is a clear and urgent need for the U.S. government to intervene,\" read the report, issued by Gladstone AI Inc.\n\nThe report also recommended the government tighten controls on the manufacture and export of AI chips.\n\nFox News Digital’s Stephen Sorace and Eric Revell, and Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Nvidia unveils robots powered by super computer and AI to take on world’s heavy industries",

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia on Monday announced a hardware and software platform for building human-like robots that includes generative artificial intelligence features.\n\nThe new platform will consist of a computer system that will power the robot and AI, plus a package of software including genAI and other tools in order to build robots that are human-life, the company said at its annual developer conference.\n\nThe addition of genAI will let the humanoid robots take actions based on inputs with a combination of language, video, \"human demonstrations,\" and past experiences. Called Project GR00T, the genAI components will add to the company's existing hardware and software platform for robotics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"These smarter, faster, better robots will be deployed in the world's heavy industries,\" said Rev Lebaredian, Vice President, Omniverse and Simulation Technology, in a briefing with reporters. \"We are working with the world's entire robot and simulation ecosystem to accelerate development and adoption.\"\n\nThe powerful computer behind the genAI software is called the \"Jetson Thor\" and is based around one of the company's AI chips and other hardware. Th computer will give a robot enough computing horsepower to perform complex tasks and interact with people and machines, the company said.\n\nThe suite of software tools is called the \"Isaac\" platform, and the new GR00T genAI features are designed to operate for \"any robot embodiment in any environment,\" it said. The tools include the ability to train the software to make better decisions over time, a process known as reinforcement learning.\n\nNvidia also said it would release pre-trained robotics models and other software that will improve robotic arm functions and multi-camera sensing capabilities.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

That includes the process of developing the technology — a stage known as training – and the running of it, which is called inference.\n\nThe Blackwell chips, which are made up of 208 billion transistors, will be the basis of new computers and other products being deployed by the world’s largest data center operators — a roster that includes Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Oracle Corp.\n\nBlackwell — named after David Blackwell, the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Science — has a tough act to follow. Its predecessor, Hopper, fueled explosive sales at Nvidia by building up the field of AI accelerator chips. The flagship product from that lineup, the H100, has become one of the most prized commodities in the tech world — fetching tens of thousands of dollars per chip.\n\nThe growth has sent Nvidia’s valuation soaring as well. It is the first chipmaker to have a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion and trails only Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. overall.\n\nHuang, Nvidia’s co-founder, said AI is the driving force in a fundamental change in the economy and that Blackwell chips are “the engine to power this new industrial revolution,” according to prepared remarks for Monday’s event. Nvidia is “working with the most dynamic companies in the world, we will realize the promise of AI for every industry,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new design has so many transistors — the tiny switches that give semiconductors their ability to store and process information — that it’s too big for conventional production techniques. It’s actually two chips married to each other through a connection that ensures they act seamlessly as one, the company said. Nvidia’s manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., will use its 4NP technique to produce the product.\n\nBlackwell will also have an improved ability to link with other chips and a new way of crunching AI-related data that speeds up the process. It’s part of the next version of the company’s “superchip” lineup, meaning it’s combined with Nvidia’s central processing unit called Grace. Users will have the choice to pair those products with new networking chips — one that uses a proprietary InfiniBand standard and another that relies on the more common Ethernet protocol. Nvidia is also updating its HGX server machines with the new chip.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company got its start selling graphics cards that became popular among computer gamers. Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, ultimately proved successful in other areas because of their ability to divide up calculations into many simpler tasks and handle them in parallel. That technology is now graduating to more complex, multistage tasks, based on ever-growing sets of data.\n\nBlackwell will help drive the transition beyond relatively simple AI jobs, such as recognizing speech or creating images, the company said. That might mean generating a three-dimensional video by simply speaking to a computer, relying on models that are have as many as 1 trillion parameters.\n\nFor all its success, Nvidia’s revenue has become highly dependent on a handful of cloud computing giants: Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Those companies are pouring cash into data centers, aiming to outdo their rivals with new AI-related services.\n\nThe challenge for Nvidia is broadening its technology to more customers. Huang aims to accomplish this by making it easier for corporations and governments to implement AI systems with their own software, hardware and services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is diving deeper into the robotics game with the debut of a new foundation model for humanoid robots dubbed Project GR00T.\n\nA foundation model is a type of AI system trained on massive amounts of data that’s capable of being used for a wide variety of tasks from generating sentences to videos, images, and more.\n\nAccording to Nvidia, Project GR00T will help humanoid robots “understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human actions — quickly learning coordination, dexterity, and other skills in order to navigate, adapt, and interact with the real world.”\n\nNvidia also announced its Isaac Manipulator and Isaac Perceptor, part of the company’s Isaac robotics platform. Isaac Manipulator is a series of foundation models designed for robotic arms, while Issac Perceptor is meant to offer “multi-camera, 3D surround-vision capabilities” for robots designed to take on manufacturing and fulfillment roles.\n\nIn addition to those, the graphics giant also debuted its Jetson Thor computer for humanoid robots. The platform, which is powered by Nvidia’s Thor system-on-a-chip, will serve as the brains of humanoid robots.

Hong, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Jetson Thor was created as a new computing platform capable of performing complex tasks and interacting safely and naturally with people and machines. It has a modular architecture optimized for performance, power, and size,” Nvidia said in a statement.\n\nThe company says it’s already working with some of the biggest names in robotics including Boston Dynamics, famous for its Spot robot, 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, and Figure AI.\n\nFigure AI, in particular, has been making waves of late, releasing a video last week in which it showed a humanoid robot speak as though it was a person in response to prompts and complete a series of tasks, including picking up dishes and putting them in a drying rack.\n\nWhile that may seem relatively mundane, the technology needed to get the robot to recognize each item and move them precisely is incredibly sophisticated.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIn February, Nvidia, as well as Microsoft, OpenAI, Jeff Bezos, Parkway Capital, Intel Capital, and others, took part in a Series B funding round for Figure AI valuing the company at $2.6 billion.\n\nHumanoid robots offer the promise of being able to complete dangerous or rote tasks for people, though as with other AI technologies, they also raise the specter of displacing human jobs. Still, don’t expect humanoid robots to start strolling down the street anytime soon.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. launched a cloud service for researchers to test out their quantum-computing software, seeking to profit from a field that’s winning funding around the world despite yielding few groundbreaking applications so far.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI Features Musk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors’ Best Interests Putin Warns Russia Won’t Stop After Predictable Election Win Nvidia Backs Little-Known Upstart in India’s Biggest AI Bet Yet Top Solar Firm Longi Plans Thousands of Job Cuts on Glut\n\nThe Nvidia Quantum Cloud will first comprise a data center stacked with AI chips and systems that together simulate a quantum computer, according to Tim Costa, director of high performance computing and quantum computing at the company. Unlike other cloud services, Nvidia’s has no quantum computer attached to it at the moment, but it will provide access to third-party quantum computers in the future, Costa told Bloomberg ahead of the GPU Technology Conference Monday.\n\nThe AI chipmaker’s cloud is years late to an already crowded arena. Microsoft Corp. started Azure Quantum in 2019, with Amazon Web Services launching Braket that same year. IBM Corp.-backed startup Strangeworks Inc. was founded in 2017 and has dozens of quantum computers on its cloud. But Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will integrate Nvidia’s quantum simulator into their offerings, Costa said.\n\nRead more: Quantum Computing Is Finally Here. But What Is It?: QuickTake\n\nThe world’s most powerful countries and corporations are pledging billions of dollars to quantum computing research, although there are few known instances where a quantum computer has run practical applications. The global zeal stems from the promise of computation speeds that are hundreds of millions times faster than supercomputers today, along with fear of the consequences — both military and commercial — for those who miss out.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor most of the 2010s, Nvidia was largely a bystander in that push. But it’s now a key player in quantum research after its graphics processing units, designed to speed up video games, paid dividends thanks to their ability to execute a certain type of computation quickly.\n\nA similar version of these calculations is used in quantum computer simulations, making Nvidia AI chips such as the H100 Tensor Core GPUs an important component of quantum research. The GPU is now also powerful enough to run classical algorithms once too big for computers, such as those used for drug and materials discovery and other scientific domains, said Costa.\n\nSeparately, Nvidia also said that its chips will be used in the publicly-funded ABCI-Q supercomputer that Fujitsu Ltd. is building for the quantum computing research arm of Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The supercomputer will use more than 2,000 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs and will be deployed early next year.\n\nThe company said that supercomputers at Denmark’s Novo Nordisk Foundation and Australia’s Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, both dedicated to quantum computing research, will also use Nvidia hardware.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American Buyers Dollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad An Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls Women Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap America’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "AI utilizes powerful computers scanning vast amounts of data to draw conclusions or answer human’s questions efficiently. Consequently, data storage companies will benefit tremendously from the proliferation of AI. Data Center Dynamics recently said, “However intangible the cloud might sound, it still needs physical hard drives to store the data for which AI is ravenous…. AI’s dependence on data will mean greater demand for cloud data storage…which means surging demand for hard drives.” Firms specializing in data storage should thrive in the medium- and the long-term. For investors who want to capitalize on these trends, here are three storage stocks poised to capitalize on the data explosion.\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) The Pure Storage logo at the entrance to its office in Mountain View, California. PSTG stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nData storage provider, Pure Storage (NASDAQ:PSTG), expects its top line to jump 15% YOY to $680 million. Analysts, on average, had predicted that its Q1 revenue would come in at $670 million.\n\n“Pure (Storage) delivered healthy results and offered an encouraging double-digit revenue growth outlook — along with modest margin expansion,” investment bank William Blair wrote in a note to investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCiti recently started coverage of the shares with a “Buy” rating and a $65 price target. According to the bank, PSTG will benefit from its flash memory business. This business will get a boost from the proliferation of AI and machine learning.\n\nGiven all of PSTG’s positive attributes, it’s definitely one of the best storage stocks to buy.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) markets flash memory products. Citi recently predicted that the company would deliver “beat-and-raise” fiscal Q2 results, driven by its product’s high prices and demand. The bank noted that some of Micron’s more expensive products are used in conjunction with Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. Of course, the demand for Nvidia’s processors is currently very strong. Citi also added that MU stock deserves a high valuation due to its link to the AI boom, and the bank placed a $150 price target on the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Micron will probably receive subsidies from the Biden administration for its factories, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMU has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 13.7 times.\n\nData Storage (DTST) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nData Storage (NASDAQ:DTST) provides data vaulting services. These services are defined as “a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy that requires a copy of each data backup to be stored in a place that’s physically isolated from primary backup and production environments.” The data can be stored in the cloud or in a physical location. DTST also provides cybersecurity products.\n\nIn Q3, DTST’s top line jumped 35% YOY to $6 million, while its income (loss) from operations came in at $14,000, up from a loss of $223,000 in Q3 of 2022. In the first nine months of last year, its operating activities generated net cash of $2.16 million.\n\nInvestor’s Business Daily gives DTST a Composite Rating of 98 out of 99 and an Accumulation/Distribution rating of A, indicating that institutional investors have been buying large amounts of its shares in the last 13 weeks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

AWS will offer the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs, extending the companies’ longstanding strategic collaboration to deliver the most secure and advanced infrastructure, software, and services to help customers unlock new generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nNVIDIA and AWS continue to bring together the best of their technologies, including NVIDIA’s newest multi-node systems featuring the next-generation NVIDIA Blackwell platform and AI software, AWS’s Nitro System and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) advanced security, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) petabit scale networking, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) UltraCluster hyper-scale clustering. Together, they deliver the infrastructure and tools that enable customers to build and run real-time inference on multi-trillion parameter large language models (LLMs) faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The deep collaboration between our two organizations goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world’s first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of NVIDIA GPU solutions for customers,\" said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. \"NVIDIA’s next-generation Grace Blackwell processor marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing. When combined with AWS’s powerful Elastic Fabric Adapter Networking, Amazon EC2 UltraClusters’ hyper-scale clustering, and our unique Nitro system’s advanced virtualization and security capabilities, we make it possible for customers to build and run multi-trillion parameter large language models faster, at massive scale, and more securely than anywhere else. Together, we continue to innovate to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\"\n\n\"AI is driving breakthroughs at an unprecedented pace, leading to new applications, business models, and innovation across industries,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"Our collaboration with AWS is accelerating new generative AI capabilities and providing customers with unprecedented computing power to push the boundaries of what's possible.\"\n\nLatest innovations from AWS and NVIDIA accelerate training of cutting-edge LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters\n\nAWS will offer the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, featuring GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink™. When connected with Amazon’s powerful networking (EFA), and supported by advanced virtualization (AWS Nitro System) and hyper-scale clustering (Amazon EC2 UltraClusters), customers can scale to thousands of GB200 Superchips. NVIDIA Blackwell on AWS delivers a massive leap forward in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models.\n\nBased on the success of the NVIDIA H100-powered EC2 P5 instances, which are available to customers for short durations through Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, AWS plans to offer EC2 instances featuring the new B100 GPUs deployed in EC2 UltraClusters for accelerating generative AI training and inference at massive scale. GB200s will also be available on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, an AI platform co-engineered on AWS, that gives enterprise developers dedicated access to the infrastructure and software needed to build and deploy advanced generative AI models. The Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud instances on AWS will accelerate development of cutting-edge generative AI and LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters.\n\nElevate AI security with AWS Nitro System, AWS KMS, encrypted EFA, and Blackwell encryption\n\nAs customers move quickly to implement AI in their organizations, they need to know that their data is being handled securely throughout their training workflow. The security of model weights—the parameters that a model learns during training that are critical for its ability to make predictions—is paramount to protecting customers’ intellectual property, preventing tampering with models, and maintaining model integrity.\n\nAWS AI infrastructure and services already have security features in place to give customers control over their data and ensure that it is not shared with third-party model providers. The combination of the AWS Nitro System and the NVIDIA GB200 takes AI security even further by preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing model weights. The GB200 allows physical encryption of the NVLink connections between GPUs and encrypts data transfer from the Grace CPU to the Blackwell GPU, while EFA encrypts data across servers for distributed training and inference. The GB200 will also benefit from the AWS Nitro System, which offloads I/O for functions from the host CPU/GPU to specialized AWS hardware to deliver more consistent performance, while its enhanced security protects customer code and data during processing—on both the customer side and AWS side. This capability—available only on AWS—has been independently verified by NCC Group, a leading cybersecurity firm.\n\nWith the GB200 on Amazon EC2, AWS will enable customers to create a trusted execution environment alongside their EC2 instance, using AWS Nitro Enclaves and AWS KMS. Nitro Enclaves allows customers to encrypt their training data and weights with KMS, using key material under their control. The enclave can be loaded from within the GB200 instance and can communicate directly with the GB200 Superchip. This enables KMS to communicate directly with the enclave and pass key material directly to it in a cryptographically secure way. The enclave can then pass that material to the GB200, protected from the customer instance and preventing AWS operators from ever accessing the key or decrypting the training data or model weights, giving customers unparalleled control over their data.\n\nProject Ceiba taps Blackwell to propel NVIDIA’s future generative AI innovation on AWS\n\nAnnounced at AWS re:Invent 2023, Project Ceiba is a collaboration between NVIDIA and AWS to build one of the world’s fastest AI supercomputers. Hosted exclusively on AWS, the supercomputer is available for NVIDIA’s own research and development. This first-of-its-kind supercomputer with 20,736 B200 GPUs is being built using the new NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, a system featuring fifth-generation NVLink connected to 10,368 NVIDIA Grace CPUs. The system scales out using fourth-generation EFA networking, providing up to 800 Gbps per Superchip of low-latency, high-bandwidth networking throughput—capable of processing a massive 414 exaflops of AI—a 6x performance increase over earlier plans to build Ceiba on the Hopper architecture. NVIDIA research and development teams will use Ceiba to advance AI for LLMs, graphics (image/video/3D generation) and simulation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, NVIDIA Earth-2 climate prediction, and more to help NVIDIA propel future generative AI innovation.\n\nAWS and NVIDIA collaboration accelerates development of generative AI applications and advance use cases in healthcare and life sciences\n\nAWS and NVIDIA have joined forces to offer high-performance, low-cost inference for generative AI with Amazon SageMaker integration with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Customers can use this combination to quickly deploy FMs that are pre-compiled and optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs to SageMaker, reducing the time-to-market for generative AI applications.\n\nAWS and NVIDIA have teamed up to expand computer-aided drug discovery with new NVIDIA BioNeMo™ FMs for generative chemistry, protein structure prediction, and understanding how drug molecules interact with targets. These new models will soon be available on AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service that helps healthcare and life sciences organizations store, query, and analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data.\n\nAWS HealthOmics and NVIDIA Healthcare teams are also working together to launch generative AI microservices to advance drug discovery, medtech, and digital health—delivering a new catalog of GPU-accelerated cloud endpoints for biology, chemistry, imaging and healthcare data so healthcare enterprises can take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI on AWS.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\n\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his program on March 12 recalled his obsession with the stock market as a kid and how he became interested in companies and investing when he was just a fourth grader. Cramer advised his viewers to introduce their kids to investing as early as possible. Cramer said you should pick some companies that your kids are familiar with and ask them to guess which one of them would perform the best over time.\n\n“Get them started early…. The stock is a long-term contest. The earlier you get in, the more you can potentially win, over the long haul.”\n\n\"Stocks Still Represent the Greatest Opportunity\"\n\nAnswering a question in the same program, Jim Cramer advised investors not to put “too much money” in bonds because Cramer believes “stocks still represent the greatest opportunity.”\n\nIn a separate program on March 15, in which Cramer talked about his career in the Wall Street and how he witnessed some of the biggest market crashes in history, the CNBC host said when you are in your 20s you should invest in growth. Cramer said younger people should take more risk early in life because they have many years ahead of them. Cramer said he “really wants risk taking” when you are younger.\n\nCramer also advised investors not to put all their money in a stock at once. Instead, Cramer recommended that you should invest some in the start and then buy more when the stock is going down.\n\nTalking about some of the worst market crashes in US history, Cramer said:\n\n“Tough days don't last forever people but when they come along you need to know how to respond.” Jim Cramer’s Predictions Were Right About These 11 Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nWe cover Jim Cramer's stock picks and recommendations every week. But how have Cramer's stock picks been performing? Everyone knows Cramer is bullish on mega-cap companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) and they are going strong. But what about several others stocks Cramer recommended buying and selling over the past few months? In this article we decided to take a look at the stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy and sell in 2023 or early 2024 and saw how these companies have performed so far in 2024 based on their year-to-date stock performance.\n\nStory continues\n\n9. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nIn August last year, Jim Cramer said investing in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was like “sending your money up in smoke.”\n\nIn July, Cramer said the following about Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB):\n\n“No, let’s move on from Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB), let’s move on from them. They’re losing money... it’s not my cup of tea.”\n\nRocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) shares are down by about 22% this year through March 18.\n\nLast month the company talked about guidance and key business updates during its Q4 earnings call:\n\n\"Overall, we expect gross margin trends will continue to improve over time, thanks to the same factors that help drive improvement this year. In terms of when we can get to adjusted EBITDA breakeven Neutron investment, especially R&D spend, continues to be the pacing item to achieve its critical milestone. Turning to our recent fundraising of $355 million in convertible senior notes. With this financing, we believe we secured a large quantum of cost-effective and shareholder-friendly capital. The roughly $300 million of proceeds, net of our capped call and deal fees, positions the company to exercise inorganic adoptions to further vertically integrate our supply chain with the critical capabilities that are consistent with what we have done successfully in the past, which has enabled larger and more strategic program wins like the recent $0.5 billion SDA program.\n\nWith that, let’s turn to our guidance for the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the first quarter to range between $92 million and $98 million, representing sequential revenue growth of between 53% and 63%. This range reflects $60 million to $65 million of contribution from space systems and $32 million to $33 million from launch services, which assumes four launches. Although modestly lower than what we previously expected for Q4 just a few months ago. We don’t want to understate how encouraged we are with the magnitude of this forecasted quarter-on-quarter growth and how positively it reflects on the capabilities of the team to deliver this level of growth in such a complex and competitive set of businesses. We expect first quarter GAAP gross margin to range between 24% to 26% and non-GAAP gross margins to range between 29% to 31%.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nArlington, Virginia-based defense contractor AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) ranks 8th in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about.  In December 2023, Jim Cramer had praised AeroVironment, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVAV) quarterly results and said that AeroVironment, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AVAV) CEO Wahid Nawabi was doing a “terrific job.”\n\n“So I would be a buyer of the stock,” Cramer said at the time.\n\nNawabi earlier this month talked about key company updates and guidance during latest earnings call:\n\n\"With a strong third-quarter performance behind us, we’re increasing and narrowing our guidance range for fiscal year 2024 as follows. We now anticipate revenue of $700 million to $710 million. Full-year net income of $51 million to $55 million or $1.86 to $2 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $122 million to $127 million. Non-GAAP earnings of $2.69 to $2.83 per diluted share. And R&D spend totaling 13% to 14% of revenue. We remain confident in our growth trajectory for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025. Our backlog remains strong, our visibility is nearly 100%, and our pipeline continues to expand. While we await approvals on the continuing resolution in supplemental assistance package in Congress, we remain hopeful that a bipartisan agreement will be reached soon.\n\nWe stand ready with our cutting-edge battle-tested solutions and unmatched manufacturing capacity to meet our customers needs. Given our strong performance, we remain on a trajectory of our best year ever again. As stated in the past, our expectations for this year and beyond are not driven by a single product or customer, but by the overall expanding global demand and our autonomous AI-enabled unmanned solutions. We are ideally suited to continue this growth trajectory given our global installed base, battle-tested solution offering, successful track record, proven best-in-class technology, agile product development cycle, and unmatched manufacturing capacity. As our addressable markets expand, we remain well-positioned to benefit from budget priorities in the U.S. and abroad as an industry leader and the original defense technology innovator.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nAeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) stock has gained about 20% in 2024 through March 18. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nEarlier this month AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) posted Q3 results, reporting an EPS of $0.63 for the quarter, beating estimates by $0.29.\n\n7. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer has been recommending investors to dump Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) for quite some time now. In December Cramer said he had decided to “pull the plug” on the stock. In August last year Cramer advised investors to sell the stock because he believed Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) was disappointing. Cramer was right, based on the stock’s performance so far this year. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares have lost about 27% in 2024 through March 18.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). Jim Cramer recommends selling PLUG but he is bullish on companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n6. Telus Corp (NYSE:TU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nIn August 2023, Jim Cramer said the following about Canadian-based telecom company Telus Corp (NYSE:TU):\n\n“I think they’re a loser, honestly. I mean, honestly. They’re just doing a terrible job. We do not need that, there’s like 40 other guys in that same space that are better.”\n\nTelus Corp (NYSE:TU) shares have dipped by about 7% this year and about 17% over the past one year.\n\n5. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nLithium metal batteries company Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was right about. Back in July 2023, Jim Cramer had told his viewers that there was “nothing there” for this stock and took a “hard pass” on it when asked about his take on Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). Over the past one year Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) shares have lost about 25% in value.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS) during this period was Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management which owns a $23.2 million stake in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS). While Cramer is bearish on QS, he recommends buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Made Accurate Predictions About These 4 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "The Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), a fund largely composed of tech stocks, has soared 45% over the past year. And in some specific semiconductor and AI-related names, the gains have been parabolic. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has rocketed more than 1,000% over the past 12 months, to give one example.\n\nWhile the gains have been extraordinary, there’s no guarantee that the good times will keep on rolling. For one thing, the Federal Reserve may back away from its plans to cut interest rates given a recent string of hot inflation readings. And for another, while AI is a technology with extraordinary promise, it is far less certain how the proliferation of AI tools will impact corporate earnings.\n\nParticularly within the tech stock space, there are some companies that have seen shares run-up with the AI wave but which may not actually see their businesses improve in the months and years to come. With valuations at lofty levels, it’s time to sell these tech stocks before the inevitable correction arrives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) finds itself in an interesting place, as it pertains to artificial intelligence. The graphics software company could find itself benefitting if AI enables faster workflows and broadens the addressable marketplace for its services.\n\nOn the other hand, artificial intelligence could cause many of Autodesk’s current customers to abandon Autodesk’s solutions entirely and outsource everything to AI.\n\nThis risk came to a head last week when another graphics software firm, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) saw shares fall 14% following a soft earnings report. Adobe already dipped in February following the debut of OpenAI’s Sora text-to-video generator. And Adobe’s underwhelming earnings report added to the concerns that AI could be a Trojan horse for the graphics software space.\n\nTurning to Autodesk, its shares have rallied 30% over the past year, in part due to hopes that AI will add to its bottom line. But, like Adobe, it faces the risk that nimble competitors will be able to use bespoke AI tools to whittle away at chunks of Autodesk’s core design and digital prototyping market. With Autodesk selling at 32 times estimated fiscal year 2025 earnings, there is little room for error here if anything goes wrong for Autodesk on a business execution standpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarvell Technologies (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor company which is involved in a number of different chip businesses. It focuses on System-on-a-Chip architectures along with Ethernet solutions, electro-optical products and custom application specific integrated circuits among others.\n\nWhile Marvell is broadly diversified across chip types, its AI product offerings have garnered most of the attention in recent months. Marvell makes a point of highlighting its partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its focus on delivering AI infrastructure for the AI Era.\n\nShares of MRVL stock soared over the past year thanks to the hopes that Marvell’s AI positioning would lead to robust profit growth. Alas, it wasn’t to be.\n\nMarvell’s recent Q4 results were a huge disappointment. The company grew revenues just 1% year-over-year. Making matters worse, Marvell reported a net loss for the quarter. And the weakness is expected to continue into fiscal year 2025; the company offered Q1 guidance far below Wall Street estimates and noted that its gross margin may fall sequentially. For all the hype around AI growth, for companies such as Marvell, it hasn’t translated into meaningful results on the bottom line.\n\nAirship AI Holdings (AISP) Stock Photo ID: 1659535744 Industrial technology concept. Container terminal. Logistics. Communication network. Secured logistics. GFAI stock.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock.com\n\nAirship AI Holdings (NASDAQ:AISP) offers a software platform for video, sensor, and data management surveillance focused on law enforcement and crime prevention solutions. With the focus on artificial intelligence, traders have taken an interest in AISP stock; shares have leapt fivefold in the month of March.\n\nTo put more context on that, Airship AI came public via a SPAC with BYTE Acquistion. Shares dropped from the initial $10 offering price down to less than $2, as the business didn’t appear to be showing much initial momentum.\n\nEven based on the firm’s SPAC investor presentation, it looked like revenues were only growing around 10-15% per year and the company was projected to generate just $14.5 million in revenues in 2022.\n\nShares are rocketing lately on a series of new project announcements. However, without much tangible in the way of revenues or profits, it’s hard to forecast how much these contracts really add to the bottom line.\n\nIn any case, Airship AI has been in business since 2006 and is still generating quite limited revenues after 18 years. I’m highly skeptical that the current AI wave will suddenly turn this struggling software firm’s fortunes around. With the stock up fivefold virtually overnight, traders should head to the exits.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Monday, jumping as much as 5.2%. As of 11:07 a.m. ET today, the rally had faded somewhat, though the stock was still up 0.5%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker higher was increasing confidence in its artificial intelligence (AI) prospects on Wall Street, resulting in a pair of price target increases.\n\nA massive opportunity\n\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee maintained his buy rating on the stock while increasing his price target to $1,050. That suggests potential upside of more than 20% compared to Friday's closing price -- and on top of the stock's 500% gains since the beginning of 2023. The analyst cited Nvidia's expansion beyond graphics processing units (GPUs) into central processing units and software to power its AI-centric processors.\n\nNot to be outdone, analysts at Truist kept a buy rating on the shares, while increasing their price target to $1,177, which would represent potential upside of 34%. The company cited Nvidia's \"culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive investment in software, services & models\" as the reason for the company's growing lead in AI. The analysts went so far as to call Nvidia \"the AI company.\"\n\nHosting the \"Woodstock of AI\"\n\nThis growing confidence comes as Nvidia kicks off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) today. The company is expected to unveil the next generation of generative AI-centric products.\n\nThe highly anticipated B100 aims to be the world's most advanced and powerful AI processor, and it could double the capabilities of its predecessor, the H100. Investors are waiting to hear from CEO Jensen Huang, who is expected to present the keynote address later today.\n\nThis highlights Nvidia's relentless innovation, which has helped catapult the company to the lead in providing processors used for generative AI.\n\nAfter Nvidia's meteoric rise over the past year or so, investors have begun to wonder if the rally could continue. The stock currently trades for 36 times forward earnings and 17 times forward sales, sending some shareholders to the sidelines.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, management forecasts triple-digit year-over-year growth in its 2025 fiscal first quarter, which ends in late April. Growth of that magnitude is certainly deserving of a premium, suggesting investors buckle in for the wild ride to come. Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\n\nOr how the thick margin of safety at Intel, backed by listed stakes and real saleable assets, compares to the slim margin for error at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), trading at 13 times next year’s projected revenue. That revenue that could be competed away over time, while Intel’s semiconductor “fabs” in the US are increasingly valuable as the east and the west drift further apart.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in fifth position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Insiders are Selling These 5 Stocks in 2024.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as the Fed meets this week to decide its future plan of action to tackle inflation, which remains sticky. Overall, the market seems not much worried about the inflation problem as investors are pumping money into equities despite deafening recession warnings from the bears. Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett recently said in a note that US equity funds saw inflows worth $56 billion in the week ending March 13.\n\nWhile Hartnett said the labor market is finally starting to “crack,” some sections of the market are coming to terms with the possibility of a higher for longer scenario, since consumer spending is still high and the market is not showing signs a slowdown that was expected when rate hikes started\n\n“We thought we had two feet on the brakes, but maybe we in fact only have one foot on the brakes, and that’s why we haven’t seen as much of a reduction in demand,” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said, according to a Wall Street Journal report that discussed in detail how the housing market in the US remains resilient despite rate hikes.\n\nBarclays in a latest note tried to explain why exactly the markets keep rallying despite rising inflation and recession worries.\n\nBarclays strategists led by Emmanuel Cau said even after hotter-than-expected inflation reports, investors are still expecting at least three rate cuts from the Fed starting June.\n\n“…investors continue to see the glass half full on the soft landing narrative,” Barclays analysts noted.\n\nBut Barclays said if the Fed decides to take a more \"aggressive\" stance in response to the current resurgence of inflation, the optimistic mood in the market could reverse. Insiders Are Selling These 5 Stocks in 2024\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the stocks insiders are selling.

CCC Intelligent Solutions is the largest software as a service (SaaS) provider to both the accident claims process for US insurance companies and the US auto repair facilities market. We believe the company’s scale and longevity (founded in 1980) give it knowledge advantages in areas such as expected repair costs, parts availability and repair workflows. Furthermore, as a low-cost provider, the company benefits from insurers’ efforts to drive down repair costs and rental car times. We believe the company will drive growth by continuing to cross-sell and up-sell to its legacy customer base, expand its market share and monetize transactions over its platform. The company reported earnings results that were thesis affirming, and we took advantage of a secondary offering to build this GardenSM position.”\n\n7. Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nOhio-based Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks that are seeing insider selling activity so far in 2024. On March 4, Warburg Pincus & Co., which has a director status at Sotera Health Co's (NASDAQ:SHC) board, sold 16,594,363 shares of Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC) at $14.31 per share. The stock is down 0.48% since then.\n\nLast month, Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC) announced the launch of a secondary offering of 25 million shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share. These shares were being offered by selling stockholders, which include affiliates of Warburg Pincus and GTCR, as well as two members of management and one member of the Board of Directors of Sotera Health Co (NASDAQ:SHC).\n\nStocks that saw insider selling recently also include Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nMcIntyre Partnerships stated the following regarding Sotera Health Company (NASDAQ:SHC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The notable outlier to our “generally good” overall portfolio was Sotera Health Company (NASDAQ:SHC), where the settlement I was expecting drove shares up by over 100% in January 2023. In response to the outsized move, I reduced the position by roughly half. After its January surge, SHC’s shares have largely been range-bound. Despite the significant gain and lackluster performance since, I believe SHC remains a compelling investment. It is the fund’s largest position, and I go into greater depth below.\n\nAt quarter end, our exposures are 102% long, 6% short, and 96% net. Our five largest positions are SHC, OSW, GTX, record labels, and STHO/SAFE, and account for roughly 80% of assets.\n\nIn a vacuum, SHC screens as my ideal type of business: one half of a duopoly market with good long-term growth where the product sold is mission critical to customers, with high switching costs, yet the product’s cost is immaterial to their customers. In the case of SHC, the company is one of two scaled outsourced providers of medical device and pharmaceutical sterilization services. SHC is diversified across almost all major medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, boasts a 100% retention rate with top customers, and has consistently grown sales at close to 10%. Further, sterilization represents ~1% of their customers’ cost of goods sold, and SHC has an ~55% EBITDA margin. Normally, a consistent 10% growth story with 55% margins would trade at a significant multiple. Indeed, from when SHC IPOed in late 2020 until legal fears derailed the stock in fall 2022, shares consistently traded over 18x EV/EBITDA and 25x P/E, yet shares currently trade less than 12x my 2024 EV/EBITDA and 15x my 2024 EPS…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.

        "content": "Is enterprise artificial intelligence company C3.ai (NYSE:AI) the real deal, or just a speculative hype story? The answer, as usual, can be found in the financial data. Don’t dismiss AI stock as a bursting bubble, as C3.ai’s forecast-beating revenue growth is indisputable.\n\nInvestors might find it frustrating that the C3.ai share price still hasn’t recovered to $100. That’s a long way away, but $50 is possible in 2024. If you’re still skeptical, stick around and we’ll figure out why analysts are raising their C3.ai stock price targets.\n\nC3.ai CEO: AI’s Impact ‘Is Not Ephemeral’\n\nThomas Siebel, C3.ai’s chief executive, doesn’t mince words. He said in a recent interview that the affect of AI “is not ephemeral” and added, “This is very significant. It’s a very important and it’s going to be huge.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) blockbuster fourth-quarter 2023results tend to confirm Siebel’s optimism about the future of AI. But then, C3.ai also delivered outstanding quarterly results indicating strong AI-market demand.\n\nIndeed, Siebel has every right to declare that fiscal 2024’s third quarter was a “great quarter” for C3.ai.\n\nThe company grew its revenue 18% year over year to $78.4 million, beating the analysts’ consensus estimate of $76.14 million. This result also came in above C3.ai’s previously published guidance of $74 million to $78 million in expected quarterly revenue.\n\nWhat about the bottom-line results? In Q3 of fiscal 2024, C3.ai reported a non-GAAP net earnings loss of 13 cents per share. That’s a lot better than the loss of 28 cents per share analysts had expected.\n\nSo, if you’re a stickler for profitability, I encourage you to keep an open mind. C3.ai isn’t currently profitable, but a net loss of 13 cents per share isn’t terrible if AI stock is $30 or more.\n\nAnalysts Expect AI Stock to Rally\n\nConsidering C3.ai’s excellent quarterly results, Wall Street’s experts took notice and some of them envision significantly higher C3.ai share prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his AI stock price target from $35 to $40. Furthermore, Ives views Q3 FY2024 as a “step in the right direction for C3.”\n\nMeanwhile, Canaccord analysts lifted their C3.ai stock price target from $27 to $31, and Morgan Stanley analysts increased their price target on C3.ai shares from $20 to $21.\n\nHowever, the Morgan Stanley analysts will probably have to revise their price target, since C3.ai shares rallied to $33 post-earnings.\n\nI tend to concur with Ives’ optimistic price target. C3.ai expected to generate revenue of $306 million to $310 million for fiscal 2024, and that range is above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $305.6 million.\n\nIf C3.ai hits its target revenue range, AI stock deserves to move higher in the coming months.\n\nAI Stock: $50+ Is Only a Matter of Time\n\nIves envisions the C3.ai stock price reaching $40, but that forecast might be too conservative. After all, C3.ai just posted forecast-beating results and optimistic full year revenue guidance.\n\nMaybe it will just take a little more time for analysts to appreciate C3.ai’s growth potential. In the meantime, investors should target $50 or more for AI stock and can start building their share position now.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock This Week?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has climbed a mind-blowing 80% since the start of the year as the company's earnings continue to reach record levels -- and all this is thanks to its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. The tech giant holds more than an 80% share and sells a broad portfolio of products and services to power AI projects.\n\nThe secret of Nvidia's success is simple: The company sells the fastest chip around. Today, this is the H100 graphics processing unit (GPU), but Nvidia is set to launch new products in the months and years ahead as it pours investment into research and development (R&D). The company's R&D spending rose 18% last year to $8.6 billion.\n\nAll this means Nvidia's share price performance may be far from over -- and this week in particular, it may get a boost. Nvidia's holding its GTC AI Conference from Monday through Thursday, featuring a keynote speech by CEO Jensen Huang and more than 900 sessions involving industry experts. This is the first time the conference is being held in person since prior to the pandemic, so excitement is brewing. Should you rush to buy Nvidia stock this week to get in on the action? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHuang's GTC keynote\n\nFirst, a few notes about what to expect. Investors will listen closely to Huang's Monday keynote, focused on what's to come in accelerated computing, generative AI, and robotics. This should offer us a view of the environment for both the company and the industry in the coming year.\n\nSome speculate that this week, Nvidia will introduce the much-anticipated Blackwell, its next-generation GPU architecture, and specifically the B100 AI chip. The B100 to power AI innovation will more than double the performance of Nvidia's soon-to-be released H200 when it comes to inference, according to Videocardz.com, citing an earlier Nvidia presentation.\n\nThe company hasn't announced a specific release date for Blackwell, but information offered so far suggests it should happen later this year. During the GTC conference, Huang may also update the crowd on other products, or even collaborations with partners.\n\nStory continues\n\nA risk Nvidia faces is the idea that rivals could eat into its market share, so the company's ability to continually improve its GPUs and stay ahead is critical. That's why news about Blackwell and any other clues about the company's innovations are such important points to watch.\n\nAll this could support the idea that Nvidia's spectacular AI growth is far from over -- and may just be getting started. If this is the case, the record levels of earnings we've seen so far aren't set to fall, and new records could be right around the corner. Optimism about this may translate into strong share performance for Nvidia in the coming days.\n\nA long-term buy\n\nSo, let's get back to our question: Should you buy shares of Nvidia this week to potentially benefit from the momentum? Not necessarily. Nvidia represents a top long-term buy, so if you get in on this exciting story today, a week from now, or further down the road, you still could win. If you hold on to Nvidia shares for at least five years, one particular gain or loss over a period of days is unlikely to affect your returns by much.\n\nThis means that if you don't have the time or the cash to invest in Nvidia right this moment, that's OK. Considering the company's dominance in the high-growth AI market and its rapid pace of innovation, earnings and the share price could continue to climb over the long haul -- and this means you don't have to buy the stock during one particular week.\n\nThat said, if you do have the chance to invest in Nvidia, whether the stock rises, falls, or remains unchanged this week, now is a great time to get in on this AI tech story. The shares trade for 36 times forward earnings estimates, a very reasonable level considering Nvidia's tremendous growth prospects. Nvidia has already scored an AI win, but there may be many more AI wins to come -- and that could be great news for investors who choose to buy and hold the stock for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all firmly placed the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and blasted to record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength in various sectors and industries, much of the heavy lifting for the current bull market can be attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAs their collective name implies, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. They're often industry leaders (sometimes in more than one category) and traditionally on the cutting edge of technological innovation(s). In order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAll seven of these companies have overwhelmingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over extended periods. This is a fact that's not lost on Wall Street's brightest and most successful institutional money managers.\n\nHowever, there was a discernible shift in sentiment among billionaire investors during the December-ended quarter concerning the top-performing Magnificent Seven component: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia.\n\nSurprise! Billionaire money managers are selling AI stock Nvidia\n\nInvestors who've put their money to work in artificial intelligence stocks have been handsomely rewarded -- perhaps none more so than Nvidia's shareholders.\n\nIn a little over a year's time, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) account for the lion's share of GPUs currently in use in AI-accelerated data centers. In fact, many of the company's top customers are Magnificent Seven members, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimists fully expect Nvidia to keep its foot on the accelerator as it ramps production of its prized A100 and H100 GPUs. With supply chain issues easing -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing boosting its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity -- Nvidia should be able to meet demand from more of its customers this year.\n\nHowever, the Nvidia growth story may not be as picture-perfect as its stock chart would suggest. Aside from well-established valuation concerns, Nvidia is set to face a flurry of operating headwinds. Perhaps that's what compelled eight billionaires to sell shares of Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nMost investors in AI stocks/Nvidia have probably heard all about incoming competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies have GPUs they've launched or plan to launch this year that are specifically designed to compete with Nvidia in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe far bigger concern for Nvidia is that the aforementioned four Magnificent Seven members that account for 40% of its sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all developing AI chips of their own for use in their data centers. A significant percentage of Nvidia's sales may go away if these core customers shift to in-house AI chips. At best, Nvidia will see less in the way of purchases from these four juggernauts.\n\nAnother kick in the pants for Nvidia is that U.S. regulators are actively restricting exports of high-powered AI GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy, China. After the first round of restrictions, Nvidia developed toned-down versions of its powerhouse AI GPUs, the A800 and H800, for the Chinese market. However, the newest round of export restrictions affects these models, too.\n\nThere's also a strong likelihood that Nvidia will sap its own gross margin as it increases production of its top-selling GPUs. With data center sales growing many multiples faster than cost of revenue in fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on Jan. 28, 2024), it clearly shows that pricing power, not an increase in units sold, drove the company's sales higher. As GPU scarcity tapers, so will Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA multi-industry leader has been a popular buy for billionaire investors\n\nTo be perfectly fair, Nvidia wasn't the only AI stock and member of the Magnificent Seven that billionaire investors put on the chopping block during the fourth quarter. Prominent billionaire money managers commonly sold Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and even Microsoft stock during the previous quarter.\n\nBut there was one exception to this selling: E-commerce and cloud-services frontrunner Amazon. All told, eight high-profile billionaires piled into this multi-industry leader, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe biggest risk for Amazon at the moment is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future. A couple of prominent money-based metrics and predictive tools suggest that the economy may weaken later this year. Since Amazon is the world's leading online marketplace and generates a sizable percentage of its sales from e-commerce, there's the logical perception that a recession would be trouble.\n\nYet what's interesting about Amazon is that very little of its operating cash flow or net income derives from online retail sales. Rather, the bulk of the company's cash flow and profits can be traced to its three fast-growing ancillary operating segments: Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nA strong argument can be made that AWS is the single most important puzzle piece at Amazon. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, and AWS accounted for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. In other words, a sustained double-digit growth rate should be the expectation for this high-margin segment.\n\nDon't overlook the importance of advertising services, either. Amazon is one of the most visited social sites in the world, with 2.3 billion to 2.7 billion aggregate visitors each month from July 2023 through December 2023. These are predominantly motivated shoppers, which makes Amazon a logical go-to for merchants wanting to target users with their message.\n\nWith regard to subscription services, Amazon surpassed 200 million worldwide Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos. The addition of Thursday Night Football as exclusive content has likely only added to this figure.\n\nAlthough Amazon may not appear cheap based on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, it's valued at a historically inexpensive multiple relative to its future cash flow. Billionaire investors recognize a long-term value when they see one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Real Reason Why This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Has Been the S&amp;P 500's Top Performer in 2023 and 2024",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) took the S&P 500 by storm in 2023, gaining 239% to become the best-performing stock in the index that year. The trend has continued in 2024 -- Nvidia is up 80% year to date and is again the best-performing S&P 500 component.\n\nThere's certainly a degree to which hype is now driving Nvidia's unstoppable run. But the fundamental reason the stock is soaring is earnings growth. Specifically, growth from its compute and networking segment, led by sales to data centers.\n\nLet's consider why the exponential growth from Nvidia's data center business seemed to come out of nowhere, whether the business has room to run, and some headwinds investors should consider before buying this semiconductor stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe backbone of AI\n\nYou've probably heard a lot about how Nvidia is powering artificial intelligence (AI) but may be wondering how that actually works in practice.\n\nAs the internet has expanded, it has demanded more and more computing power. The rapid transfer of information got so intense, and data security became so vital, that localized data centers were no longer good enough. As a result, centralized data centers -- known as cloud infrastructure -- have been developed to handle massive amounts of data as efficiently and securely as possible.\n\nBut AI models demand unprecedented amounts of computational power. Companies cannot develop the AI solutions they want without the processing backbone to run those models. And that processing power is exactly what Nvidia is supplying through its data center business.\n\nNvidia's red-hot data center business\n\nNvidia's data center business is the foundation of the investment thesis and the core driver of the stock's recent gains. The company reports its results under two segments. Graphics focuses on sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, software for internet applications, and more. Compute and networking includes sales for data centers, AI for the automotive industry, electric vehicle computing platforms, and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wasn't long ago that graphics was Nvidia's larger segment. But in fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 29, 2023), compute and networking overtook graphics on both revenue and operating income. Here's a look at how the dynamic has shifted over the years. The growth will astonish you.\n\nMetric Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Compute and networking revenue $3.28 billion $6.84 billion $11.05 billion $15.07 billion $47.41 billion Total revenue $10.92 billion $16.68 billion $26.91 billion $26.97 billion $60.92 billion Compute and networking share of revenue 30% 41% 39.4% 55.9% 77.8% Compute and networking operating income $750 million $2.55 billion $4.60 billion $5.08 billion $32.02 billion Segment operating income* $4.02 billion $7.16 billion $13.09 billion $9.64 billion $37.86 billion Compute and networking share of segment operating income 18.7% 35.6% 35.1% 52.7% 84.5%\n\nData source: Nvidia. *Segment operating income is the sum of compute and networking operating income and graphics operating income. Unlike total operating income, segment operating income doesn't reflect expenses such as stock-based compensation, corporate infrastructure, and acquisitions because they're related to the overall business, not the functions of the individual segments. Fiscal 2024 ended Jan. 28.\n\nDuring the fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings call, Nvidia said its HGX platform, based on its Hopper GPU architecture, had delivered the vast majority of its revenue in the quarter. The supercomputing platform can handle massive datasets and complex simulations. Nvidia has made upgrades to the offering over the years. In November, it announced the HGX H200 with configurations of up to eight GPUs. Nvidia continues to make product improvements to specifically address the AI needs of customers, and it's clearly working as Nvidia's sales are through the roof.\n\nCFO Colette Kress said during the call:\n\nNvidia HDX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on Nvidia, including Adobe, Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, Now Assist with ServiceNow, and Zoom AI Companion. Our data center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investment in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning recommender systems, and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for Nvidia accelerated computing.\n\nSince Nvidia is at the forefront of AI today, it has unique insight into the industry's trajectory, allowing it to make helpful product improvements that further sustain its growth.\n\nNot all AI investments will pan out\n\nThere's a lot of speculation about how high Nvidia can fly; some wonder if the stock is grossly overvalued. But the investment thesis is actually beautifully simple. If its customers are making money on AI, then they will demand faster and safer computing power. As the use of AI grows, so too will data centers.\n\nThe issue comes down to figuring out how much of this investment is overkill and how much will prove sticky. AI applications have to be useful and accepted by users and the marketplace. For example, if companies throw billions of dollars at their efforts to make rivals to ChatGPT, then Nvidia will benefit in the short term. But the demand for GPUs created by those efforts could prove short-lived if the returns on those AI investments fail to materialize.\n\nRight now, the greatest risk to Nvidia isn't even competition because it has the best products. Rather, it's the possibility the chip industry will become overextended, setting it up for a sharp cyclical downturn.\n\nToday, investors are buying the stock with the expectation of surging data center growth. If AI investments are here to stay, then Nvidia should be a long-term winner, even from its current valuation. But some investors may want to take a wait-and-see approach with Nvidia to gauge how its data center segment performs during a slowdown rather than judging it solely by how it's doing during the biggest cyclical upswing in the company's history.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Many are concerned about the Federal Reserve's next steps in 2024, particularly regarding interest rate cuts. Recent sentiments from the Fed have led many to believe that rate cuts may be on the way, but the progression of this process may be slower than most expected. On March 15, Peter Boockvar, the Chief Investment Officer at Bleakley Financial Group, joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss recent developments in this area. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"Based on his [Powell's] testimony, just last week, he seems to wanna cut, but he wants to do it slowly and carefully, as he said.\"\n\nAccording to Boockvar, June is very much a possibility for a rate cut this year, particularly because it seems as though the Fed's Jerome Powell will want to position his rate cuts as far away as possible from the US Presidential election. The impact of this drawn-out strategy on the market may well be something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe NVIDIA GTC Conference\n\nApart from inflation news, investors should look at the position and performance of stocks in the market that have been performing well enough to keep rising. A good place to start on this front is to consider the performance of the most owned stocks by hedge funds in 2023 and beyond, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). However, perhaps one of the most exciting stocks to look at right now is the semiconductor manufacturer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In the third week of March, the company is organizing its GTC Conference, bringing together tech professionals, developers, researchers, and engineers. The main topic at the 2024 GTC is going to be artificial intelligence, an area that is ripe for investment at present.  On March 15, CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos joined the \"Halftime Report\" to highlight the main things to expect from the Conference. Here's what she said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The first thing is gonna be any update of their [NVIDIA's] architecture for a new AI chip, the Blackwell B100. We'll wanna know specs, you know, how is the memory content, if the memory content surpasses AMD's latest chip, then that's gonna be a negative for AMD. Then we'll also wanna know, maybe, some details on the average selling price, because that'll affect margins... The second major point is this adoption across enterprise... And last, not least, inferencing. Inferencing is the second part of a Large Language Model, you shoot the training in and use the training data to answer queries. On the earnings call, Jensen Huang, the CEO, said that 40% of data center revenue actually came from inferencing.\"\n\nThese comments highlight the fact that the remainder of March is going to be exciting for the tech sector, particularly the AI space, so investors should keep a sharp eye on how the GTC Conference develops. Tech is an area that makes up a large part of the list of most owned stocks by hedge funds today. As such, our list below contains many of the fastest growing technology companies in the US, alongside some of the best American tech stocks to buy. 20 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Now\n\nA financial analyst looking at a monitor displaying the stocks of the public company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds now, we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the fourth quarter and selected the top 20 stocks with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.

Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

The company operates in a single business segment, Human pharmaceutical products.\n\nEli Lilly has a deep pipeline in treatment areas focused on metabolic disorders, oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders. Currently, there are two phase three assets, Orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 and retatrutide, a triple incretin agonist, which have the potential to expand upon the potential success of Mounjaro. We believe that Mounjaro has the potential to commercialize beyond type 2 diabetes and obesity, potentially in the areas mentioned above of heart disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease. We belief the premium valuation is supported by this outsized growth profile.”\n\n18. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were down in the fourth quarter due largely to the delay of the previously announced spin-off of its cloud division. Quarterly results were roughly in line with Street expectations, with strength in profitability. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud development in China. While the company is seeing early progress in its efforts to re-invigorate customer engagement and retention as well as merchant investment initiatives, we believe this investment will likely take some time to flow through to accelerating earnings growth.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n10.

(NYSE:UBER).\n\nHere's what RiverPark Advisors said about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates.

We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”\n\n9. salesforce.com, inc.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 fastest growing AI stocks to invest in now. To skip our detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nTech: A High-Growth Sector\n\nIf you're looking for high growth stocks to invest in, the tech sector is one of the best places to start. Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be exceptional additions to any growth portfolios as this revolutionary technology continues to expand and grow to bigger heights than ever seen before. However, the fact that AI is an exciting place to invest in right now does not automatically mean that every AI stock in the market is a good growth pick for investors. Resultantly, it's important to ensure that investors carefully pick out the AI stocks that can actually deliver on their promises of growth instead of the ones that can't.\n\nOn March 15, Eric Lynch, the Portfolio Manager at Scharf Investments, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this dilemma in the AI space where investors may not know which businesses can actually grow their earnings. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"We're at a kind of 'where's the beef?' moment for AI, where all the promises need to be delivered this year. If you look at investors' reactions to several AI stories in the past week, you know Broadcom, Marvell Technology, Oracle, and most recently with Adobe yesterday, what you're seeing is a reaction to slower growth than expected.\"\n\nWinners in Artificial Intelligence in 2024\n\nAccording to Lynch, many AI companies today are lagging behind on their promises and cannot perform on par with the expectations leveled at them. As a result, it is becoming ever more important to separate the winners from the losers in this space. Lynch noted the following on which companies he sees as winners in AI:\n\n\"Obviously the chipmakers and the hyperscalers, we've seen that in the stock prices, NVIDIA, Microsoft, AWS, and most recently, Oracle. Oracle is really guiding for 50% infrastructure cloud growth going forward, because its use case was really generative AI, that it needed for its superior tech stack. So, these names are really benefitting.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThese \"winning\" AI stocks, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also among the top high growth stocks in the tech and AI sector today and have exciting developments brewing in 2024. For instance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has its GTC Conference coming soon this March, where CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote on what to expect from the company this year. Stifel's equity research analyst, Ruben Roy, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on March 15 to discuss what to expect from the keynote. Here's what he said:\n\n\"I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion on the product roadmap - NVIDIA has increased the cadence at which they bring new products to the market, I think that's really interesting. I think there's gonna be a discussion around the ecosystem that's building around their AI offerings, so it's not just about hardware, right, we're not considering NVIDIA just a chip company anymore. It's a systems company, a software company, it's a networking company. And so I think there's gonna be a lot of discussion, again, around this concept of an AI ecosystem that NVIDIA has been busy building.\"\n\nInvestors interested in artificial intelligence stocks should thus keep their eyes on the upcoming GTC conference, which is expected to bring together tech professionals for stimulating discussions on the future of AI and its impact on the world. Additionally, keeping up with the news on which AI stocks can reasonably be considered high growth stocks is also important at this point in time. As such, we have compiled a list of the fastest-growing AI stocks today, including some of the most promising AI stocks to buy and some of the most advanced AI companies to invest in. 11 Fastest Growing AI Stocks To Invest In Now\n\nPhoto by Maximalfocus on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the high growth stocks for our list below by consulting the holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF and shortlisting 11 stocks with the highest share price gains over a 5-year period as of March 16.

During the quarter, shares sold off as reported billings growth missed expectations for the second consecutive quarter, resulting in a further lowering of 2023/2024 guidance.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 best esports stocks to buy now. To skip the detailed analysis of the esports and video gaming industry, go directly to the 5 Best Esports Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nEsports is growing at a fast pace and is one of the industries that has made millionaires out of young people. For example, Illya Mulyarchuk, nicknamed Yatoro, is a 20-year-old DOTA 2 (multiplayer online battle arena video game) player who managed to grab nearly $3.7 million at the age of 18 from a single event in 2021. The massive prize pools are a testament to the rapid development of this young industry.\n\nIn 2023, Singapore became the first country to host Olympic Esports Week. In an interview with CNBC in June 2023, Singapore’s minister of state for culture, community, and youth, Alvin Tan, said that they are optimistic about the growth opportunities in the industry. The minister added that the event is a “pathfinder” in terms of revenue generation and revealed that the esports audience has reached over half a billion people. He further commented that South East Asia is the fastest-growing esports region. According to a market analysis report by Research and Markets, the global esports market was valued at around $2.56 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21.9% between 2023 and 2030 and reach $12.5 billion by the end of the forecasted period.\n\nThe expansion of the industry is sustained by a significant increase in broadcasting rights, technological innovations, and an increase in the global gaming audience. Nevertheless, the industry is still new and is in its adjustment period. Since 2022, there has been a decline in investments and sponsorship deals in the industry. On January 23, Reuters citedNewzoo’s report and said that the global gaming market declined by 4.3% in 2022. Nevertheless, it grew 0.6% in 2023 and is expected to grow by 2.8% to $189.3 billion in 2024.\n\nThe industry experienced the most significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO) gained over 100% between February 2020 and 2021. While the esports industry has been facing some challenges since 2022, the companies are still performing well as the ETF has gained over 33.89% in the last twelve months, as of March 8, compared to the S&P 500’s 8% gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nProminent Names in the Industry\n\nAs mentioned, the esports industry is quite young. However, it has managed to grab the attention of some big names in the US market. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are some companies that are deeply involved in the industry as their subsidiaries, Twitch and YouTube (respectively), hold the broadcasting rights for some of the biggest esports events in the world. In addition, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has served as a sponsor and hardware supplier for esports events, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made significant contributions with its cutting-edge graphics processing technology.\n\nTencent Holdings Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is another big name in the industry. Its US-based subsidiary, Riot Games, produced League of Legends (LoL), which was the most-viewed esports game in the world in 2023, according to Esports Insider. According to John Needham, Riot’s president of esports, their major LoL events, such as the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) and Worlds, saw significant growth in Average Minute Audience (AMA) in 2023. MSI saw an AMA increase of 58% year-over-year (YoY), while Worlds’ AMA was up by 65%. The parent company, Tencent Holdings Limited (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), is also working on expanding its video gaming business further. On March 14, Reuters reported that the company acquired two new video game units from TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) already covered 60% to 70% of the cloud gaming market and is now one of the biggest names in the video gaming and esports industry after the acquisition of Activision Blizzard (former ticker: ATVI). Here is what the Executive Vice President and CFO of the company, Amy Hood, said about the acquisition in its latest earnings call:\n\n“At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement.”\n\nHood further added:\n\n“Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned.\n\nOperating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.”\n\nOn March 1, TheFly reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is partnering with GPU hardware vendors, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), for a new API called DirectSR. The API would be used for the integration of Super Resolution into the next generation of PC video games.\n\nKeeping all of the information mentioned above in mind, some of the best esports stocks to buy now include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

        "content": "Technology stocks continue to lead the market higher and artificial intelligence remains the hot trade among investors. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq Composite index is up 9%, while the benchmark S&P 500 has increased by 8% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 3%. While the rally is broadening out to include retailers, industrial players, and financial services concerns, technology stocks continue to outperform, with many of the top names having gained more than 20% through 10 weeks of the year.\n\nWith AI growing at an exponential rate and demand for its products and services remains strong, tech stocks can be expected to continue outperforming in the months ahead. Here are hot stocks: the three best opportunities for investing in technology.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp by more than 80% year to date, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top-performing stock in both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indices so far in 2024. This builds on the 240% gain that NVDA stock achieved in 2023. If there’s one hot technology stock for investors to own now, it would be this microchip company. With a market capitalization of $2.20 trillion, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIncreasingly, NVDA stock exerts an outsized influence over the entire market. When the stock dips, the market does too. When Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the market rallies in support. As the leading producer of chips and semiconductors that power AI applications, Nvidia’s demand for its products and expectations for its share price remain sky-high. Analysts currently rate NVDA stock a “strong buy.” There are no sell ratings on the shares.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second best-performing tech stock of the year, and fourth among S&P 500 companies, is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ:META). So far in 2024, META stock has gained 40%. Over the last 12 months, the shares are up nearly 150%. Meta Platforms’ stock really took off after the company announced strong quarterly financial results and its first-ever dividend payment in early February.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Meta will pay its shareholders a dividend of 50 cents a share beginning on March 26 of this year. The company also announced an expanded $50 billion share repurchase program. While the rewards for stockholders are nice and the earnings have been impressive, Meta is also seen as a leader in AI and is gobbling up microchips from Nvidia at a fast pace to fuel its growing ambitions in the space.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another top-performing stock. NFLX stock is up more than 30% this year and has doubled in the last 12 months. This after the company overhauled its business model, adding paid advertisements to its platform for the first time, cracking down on password sharing, and moving into sports programming.\n\nThe end result has been that Netflix added 13.1 million net new subscribers in the final quarter of 2023, crushing forecasts that called for a maximum of nine million additions. Netflix is also one of the only streaming services that is turning a profit and is quickly separating itself from the pack in terms of content and subscriber growth. The strike last year by Hollywood writers and actors appears to have only been a speed bump for Netflix.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the hottest investment theme, captivating the minds of both seasoned investors and newbies alike. This is not surprising, considering multiple research firms expect the AI market to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith the AI trend having the potential to generate windfall returns, investor interest in AI stocks is at an all-time high. Two stocks, namely Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL), can prove to be compelling additions to any AI-focused stock portfolio. Here's why these stocks are smart picks now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWidely known as the poster child of the ongoing AI revolution, semiconductor giant Nvidia is making history in front of our eyes.\n\nNvidia has posted impressive results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending Jan. 28, 2024), with both revenue and earnings surpassing consensus estimates. This is an impressive performance, especially since the U.S. government's rising restrictions on chip exports to China may force Nvidia to cancel billions of dollars of chip orders in 2024. Nvidia is also battling competition from other chip players such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as from its key clients who are developing their proprietary AI chips.\n\nDespite this, the technological superiority of Nvidia's AI chips has enabled it to capture nearly 92% share in the global data center GPU market. The company's state-of-the-art GPUs (A100 and H100 chips) and advanced networking technologies (which include the InfiniBand solutions used in high-performance AI infrastructures and the recently launched Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet-based solution for AI-optimized networking) are being used extensively by data centers transitioning their trillion-dollar installed bases from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. Furthermore, enterprises across industries are also leveraging generative AI technologies across use cases, which can also present a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia's AI-optimized hardware offerings. Plus, the demand for Nvidia's chips is far outpacing supply, which has allowed the company to enjoy significant pricing power -- a key factor driving its solid data center revenue in the past few quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides hardware, Nvidia's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) programming software stack has been helping clients to optimally program its GPUs for accelerated computing applications. With the increasing adoption of accelerated computing, enterprises also need support to maintain the complex software infrastructure. Since the companies do not have large engineering teams, Nvidia considers this to be a large opportunity for its Nvidia AI Enterprise cloud-native software platform.\n\nWhile Nvidia's growth potential may seem solid, investors are rightly concerned about its sky-high valuation. Trading at 77 times its earnings, Nvidia can be considered to be a very expensive stock. However, this valuation is still cheaper than the company's three-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 95.9 and five-year average P/E multiple of 86.9. Thanks to its cutting-edge offerings, Nvidia has always traded at a solid premium. Yet, it has delivered a mind-boggling 300% return in the past year.\n\nHence, with multiple robust tailwinds and a lower-than-historical valuation, it makes sense to start accumulating a position in this stock. Investors can also opt for a dollar-cost-averaging strategy and invest their money over a longer time, to control their risk.\n\n2. Marvell Technology\n\nShares of fabless semiconductor player Marvell Technology dropped nearly 11.4% in a single day after the company released its latest earnings results (Q4 of fiscal 2024 ending Feb. 3, 2024) on March 7. Despite significant weaknesses in other end markets such as carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, and the consumer market, the AI-driven data center business continues to be a bright spot.\n\nMarvell has been investing aggressively in AI-optimized networking products and chips to benefit from the explosive growth in AI and accelerated computing markets. The company saw solid demand for its high-speed optical interconnect products (100 gig per lane 800 gig PAM products used to move huge amounts of data between chips), accelerators, and switches in traditional cloud data centers and AI-optimized data centers, in the fourth quarter. AI accounted for 10% of the company's data center revenue in fiscal 2024. Marvell expects to deploy its even faster optical interconnect products (200 gig per lane 1.6T PAM solutions) by the end of 2024.\n\nMarvell has also recently announced an extension of its long-standing partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for developing a technology platform capable of producing 2-nanometer chips for accelerated computing. This deal will enable the company to play a pivotal role in improving performance and power efficiency for next-generation AI workloads.\n\nBesides AI, there is also solid growth potential in Marvell's other business segments. While currently in a cyclical downturn, Marvell expects its carrier infrastructure, enterprise networking, and consumer segments to recover gradually in the second half of fiscal 2025. Increasing connectivity and bandwidth requirements in vehicles is also proving to be a major growth driver for the company's automotive business.\n\nConsidering the increasing demand for its AI-optimized networking products and anticipated recovery in other end markets shortly, starting a position in this stock may be a smart move in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up by a considerable 75% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n\n69% = US$30b ÷ US$43b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.69.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 69% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that NVIDIA has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 39% net income growth seen by NVIDIA over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nWe then compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 29% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nIs NVIDIA Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nNVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.2%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.\n\nBesides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.5% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that NVIDIA's future ROE will drop to 51% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: SoundHound AI vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) represent two very different ways to invest in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. SoundHound's namesake app is used to identify and discover songs, while its Houndify developer platform enables companies to create their own speech-recognition tools. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of AI servers.\n\nBoth companies have close ties to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia was one of SoundHound's earliest backers prior to its public debut in 2022, and it recently made another investment in the company. Supermicro's partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center graphics processing units (GPUs) before most of its competitors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why both stocks soared alongside Nvidia's as the AI market expanded. Over the past 12 months, SoundHound's stock jumped 248% as Supermicro's stock rallied 1,150%. But should you invest in either of these high-flying AI stocks right now?\n\nSoundHound is a speculative stock\n\nSoundHound competes against Microsoft and Alphabet's Google in the audio and speech-recognition market, but its Houndify platform is an appealing option for companies that don't want to tether themselves to those tech giants.\n\nAutomakers like Hyundai and Stellantis, smart TV makers like Vizio, and fast-food chains like Church's Chicken all use Houndify to create custom voice-recognition services. That market should continue expanding as generative AI technologies become more sophisticated. It also recently acquired the restaurant-solutions provider SYNQ3 to expand its ecosystem.\n\nSoundHound went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022. Its revenue rose 47% in both 2022 and 2023, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 51% to $69.5 million in 2024.\n\nBut based on those expectations and its enterprise value of $2.2 billion, SoundHound's stock still looks pricey at 32 times this year's sales. It's also unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and it doesn't even expect its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive until 2025. Its high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.3 could also limit its ability to raise fresh cash.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose issues could limit its upside potential as long as interest rates stay elevated, but it could still carve out a defensible niche in the evolving voice-recognition market and attract some buyout interest from its bigger competitors.\n\nSupermicro is a foundational player in the AI market\n\nSupermicro isn't the world's largest producer of pre-built servers, but it differentiated itself from its larger competitors by building high-performance servers for tougher tasks. That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which worked with Supermicro to design AI servers which used its high-end data center GPUs. Nvidia's rival AMD has also been working with Supermicro to develop new AI servers for that booming market.\n\nWhen Supermicro went public back in 2007, it didn't initially gain much attention because the server market was already heavily commoditized. But over the past few years, it became one of the market's hottest growth stocks as the generative AI market exploded and data center operators ramped up their orders of AI servers.\n\nSupermicro's revenue soared 46% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and grew another 37% in fiscal 2023. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 104% in fiscal 2024 as the market's demand for new AI servers consistently outstrips its available supply. For fiscal 2025, they expect revenue to rise another 36% to $19.8 billion.\n\nSupermicro ended its latest quarter with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8. It's profitable, and analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to soar 86% in 2024 and 35% in 2025. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those expectations at 37 times forward earnings and 3 times next year's sales. But the AI market needs to keep expanding -- and Supermicro needs to consistently grow its share of the AI server market -- for the company to reach those targets and support its rising valuations.\n\nThe better buy: Super Micro Computer\n\nBoth of these AI companies are growing rapidly, but Supermicro is clearly a better buy than SoundHound AI. Supermicro has a more established business; it has a wider moat; it's more profitable; and its stock looks cheaper. SoundHound might have gained some fresh attention with Nvidia's investment, but it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the role model for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company is worth a whopping $2.2 trillion as of this writing, with $1.5 trillion of that value added within the last 12 months alone. Nvidia's recent success boils down to its data center chips designed for processing AI workloads, which continue to attract incredible demand.\n\nBut despite capturing the lion's share of investors' attention, Nvidia isn't the only opportunity in the semiconductor space. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Axcelis Technologies(NASDAQ: ACLS).\n\nHere's why owning shares of AMD and Axcelis might be a fantastic idea, too.\n\n1. AMD is emerging as a competitor to Nvidia in data centers\n\nAMD's chips power some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, including Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series X, and even the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. However, investors' attention is now on the data center.\n\nThe company has begun shipping its latest MI300 lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads -- hardware that competes with Nvidia's industry-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The MI300 comes in two configurations: The MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to create an accelerated processing unit (APU), whereas the MI300X is a pure GPU.\n\nThe MI300A was selected by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the fastest in the world when it comes online this year. However, AMD is also experiencing strong commercial demand for the MI300 range from leading data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\n\nThe MI300 will likely send AMD's data center revenue soaring in the next few years. It won't be easy to catch Nvidia in that segment. However, AMD does have a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers. Its Ryzen 700 series (Ryzen AI) chips are designed to handle powerful AI workloads on-device, leading to faster response times for the end user because requests aren't traveling back and forth to the data center.\n\nStory continues\n\nMillions of computers from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus (among others) have already shipped with Ryzen AI chips. In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year. The company plans to launch a new processor, which is up to three times faster than previous iterations, so this business is just getting warmed up.\n\nCombined with a forecast $3.5 billion revenue contribution from the MI300 series in their first full year of sales, 2024 is set to be AMD's biggest year yet. It's no surprise that the majority of the 50 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given AMD stock the highest possible buy rating.\n\n2. Axcelis Technologies is a critical part of the chip fabrication process\n\nAxcelis Technologies isn't a glamorous producer of GPUs like Nvidia or AMD. In fact, it's relatively overlooked, with The Wall Street Journal tracking just eight analysts who cover its stock. Nevertheless, the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating, and it trades at a very attractive valuation right now, which might entice investors to follow the Street's lead.\n\nAxcelis manufactures ion implantation equipment, which is critical to the chip fabrication process. Producers of silicon carbide power devices -- which regulate electric power in workloads with high currents -- are a significant source of demand for Axcelis at the moment, thanks especially to the electric vehicle industry. Silicon carbide chemistry is more efficient than traditional silicon chemistry, which leads to more mileage per battery charge and faster charging times.\n\nThe company is also preparing for growing demand from producers of AI-related semiconductors. Last year, the company noted that AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity, which could make DRAM and NAND chips more complex to manufacture, and more expensive.\n\nAxcelis generated a record $1.13 billion in revenue during 2023, representing a 22.9% year-over-year increase. But here's the kicker: The company ended 2023 with an order backlog worth $1.2 billion, so 2024 is shaping up to be another record year.\n\nThe stock is up over 400% in the last five years, but it has taken a breather over the last few months, suffering a 44% decline from its all-time high. That might spell opportunity, because based on the company's $7.43 in earnings per share in 2023, the stock now trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. That's a 59% discount to the 35.6 P/E ratio of the iShares Semiconductor ETF, so Axcelis' stock is substantially cheaper than the rest of the chip industry, on average.\n\nMoreover, when you also consider Wall Street's bullish stance on Axcelis stock, there is a very clear case for buying it right now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Advanced Micro Devices made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 11, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "What's Preventing Nvidia From Replacing Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?",
        "content": "In February, Amazon became the third big-tech stock in nine years to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Salesforce was added in 2020 and Apple joined in 2015). With the pace of change accelerating, investors may wonder when other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will join the historic index.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is now the most valuable company not in the Dow. Even better, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) is a Dow component and would be the most obvious choice for Nvidia to replace.\n\nHere's what is preventing Nvidia from joining the Dow and why the growth stock deserves to be a Dow component in the near future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nReasons why Nvidia isn't in the Dow\n\nDow components are usually replaced because they have lost some of their industry leadership or the industry they operate isn't as important to the economy anymore. At a price of just $42 per share, Intel is the second-smallest component of the price-weighted index, ahead of Verizon.\n\nIntel stock is doing well, up over 66% in the last year. It is in the same industry as Nvidia, but it isn't a direct competitor. There's some crossover in gaming, PCs, and data centers. But Intel's main growth driver is getting into the foundry business. And Nvidia could even be a customer of Intel's advanced packaging services.\n\nIntel doesn't deserve to be replaced. It makes up such a small portion of the Dow that the semiconductor industry is, in many ways, unrepresented. It may be better to swap a different component for Nvidia. But we are getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nThe first thing Nvidia has to do is split its stock. Amazon could be added only because it split its stock in June 2022. With a price of nearly $900 a share and the median price of a Dow component around $175 a share, Nvidia would have to issue at least a 5-for-1 stock split to avoid tilting the balance of the index.\n\nAnother issue is timing. There's no schedule for Dow shakeups. But they don't happen too often. Given Amazon just got added, it's unlikely we'll get another swap for at least a couple of years. Alphabet may be first in line for a swap considering its history, market position, and the fact it already split its stock in July 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeciding which component to replace, the stock split ratio, and the timing of the next index restructuring are all relatively minor challenges in the grand scheme of things. The bigger question is whether Nvidia deserves to be a blue-chip Dow stock or if its growth is fleeting.\n\nMonetizing AI\n\nNvidia is an unrecognizable business from just a few years ago. And it's all because of data centers.\n\nGo back to fiscal 2022, and the Graphics segment a far larger segment than Compute and Networking (led by data centers) for Nvidia, generating nearly double the operating income. But in just two years, Compute and Networking performance exploded. In fiscal 2024, Compute and Networking made up 77.8% of total revenue and 84.5% of segment-operating income, with operating income up nearly seven times in that period.\n\nCustomers are rapidly building AI models and demanding more and more output from Nvidia's chips. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical. Right now, demand is outpacing supply, driving prices and margin expansion for Nvidia.\n\nFor Nvidia to sustain its torrid growth rate, AI has to be worth the expense for businesses. In other words, they have to make money on the solutions. For example, if Apple spends a fortune developing an AI assistant for every iPhone and tries to charge a monthly fee that many customers are unwilling to pay, then it's probably not going to accelerate its spending.\n\nMicrosoft is having breakout success with its AI solutions, like Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub AI, Azure AI for cloud infrastructure, and more. It's working now, but the pace of growth could change based on the market, the economy, and customer reception of these solutions.\n\nNo one knows when it will happen, but Nvidia will eventually enter a downturn, and its growth will slow. At that point, earnings will fall, and the stock will look more expensive -- as is the nature of cyclical industries. The market may be less willing to pay up for Nvidia during that period.\n\nGive Nvidia a few more years\n\nNvidia has the makings of a Dow stock. But the growth of its data center business has happened in a flash.\n\nBefore Nvidia gets added to the Dow, the market will need to see how this business does during a downturn and mid-cycle conditions. No company is going to get added to the Dow just because its business is hot right now. If that were the case, PayPal could have been added in early 2021 to replace or pair with Visa. Three years ago, PayPal briefly overtook Mastercard in market cap but is worth around seven times less than Mastercard today. Or Zoom Video Communications could have been added in 2020.\n\nThere are plenty of periods in the stock market where investors get super excited about a theme and drive valuations higher. I don't think AI is a bubble, and I think much of Nvidia's growth is here to stay. But I do expect the pace of growth to slow and want to get a better look at how Nvidia's data center business performs during that slowdown. I suspect the folks in charge of the Dow Jones Industrial Average feel the same.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "It hasn't been easy to be a stock investor in recent years, with more market volatility than usual.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw many stocks skyrocket in 2021 as homebound consumers invested in home offices and entertainment products. However, an economic downturn in 2022 brought the market crashing back down and led many companies' shares to lose what they had gained the year before.\n\nThen, in 2023, the market once again swung in the opposite direction, with the Nasdaq Composite climbing 43%. Excitement over tech and artificial intelligence (AI) prompted an impressive recovery. And the same index is up about 8% in 2024, seemingly breaking the yo-yo-like pattern that has occurred in recent years.\n\nHowever, recent volatility highlights the importance of investing in stocks with a long-term mindset. Those who sold in 2022 will not have profited from the swift rise many stocks enjoyed in 2023 and continue to see this year.\n\nAs a result, now is an excellent time to fortify your portfolio by investing in companies likely to deliver consistent gains long into the future. So, here are two hypergrowth stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTech stocks have surged over the last year thanks to a boom in AI. According to Grand View Research, the industry hit close to $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. This trajectory would see the AI market reach a valuation nearing $2 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has cornered the market on AI chips. Last year, the tech giant achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models. Nvidia's success in the industry has seen its stock increase 294% over the last year alongside soaring earnings.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen 207%, while operating income has skyrocketed 536%. Additionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% to more than $27 billion. For reference, rival chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel posted free cash flow of $1 billion and negative $14 billion last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both chipmakers, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Nvidia's stock is potentially trading at its best value in months, with its price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios declining by double digits since last July. These are helpful metrics in determining a stock's value, with the lower figure representing the better the value.\n\nAlongside a lucrative role in AI, Nvidia is a hypergrowth stock worth considering in 2024 and beyond.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a tech behemoth with a market cap of $1.8 billion, making it the world's fifth most valuable company. Since its founding almost 30 years ago, the retail giant has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nThe company was one of the hardest hit in 2022, as spikes in inflation curbed consumer spending and caused its stock to plunge 50% during the challenging year. However, Amazon pulled off an impressive turnaround last year, which has proven the value of its stock as a long-term hold.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year, with operating income more than tripling to $37 billion. Various cost-cutting moves brought profitability back to its retail segments. Meanwhile, the company's dominating position in the cloud market with Amazon Web Services granted it a promising role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by Amazon's forward P/E of 42, you get a stock price of $294.\n\nFrom its current position, this would see Amazon's stock rise 66% over the next two fiscal years. Alongside dominating positions in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon's stock is worth buying right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Wall Street Most Bullish About: AMD, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You only needed to know one thing over the last year to make a lot of money investing: Buy large-cap artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nearly all of them have delivered sizzling returns.\n\nChipmakers Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have been especially big winners. Cloud services providers Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have also taken off.\n\nBut those performances are now history. Which AI stock is Wall Street most bullish about going forward: AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, or Nvidia?\n\nAnalysts give a thumbs down to these AI stocks\n\nWe can quickly eliminate two of these big AI stocks. Wall Street doesn't have great expectations for AMD or Nvidia over the near term.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target for AMD reflects a small decline from the current price. That's not too surprising, considering the stock has skyrocketed more than 130% over the last 12 months. Many analysts seem to think that AMD is due for a breather.\n\nIt's a similar story with Nvidia. The stock has nearly tripled over the last year, thanks to surging demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs). But while that demand doesn't appear to be waning, the consensus on Wall Street is that Nvidia's shares don't have much more room to run. The average price target is a little lower than the current share price.\n\nNot every analyst gives a thumbs down to these two AI chipmakers, though. The most optimistic analysts think that AMD and Nvidia can still soar nearly 40% and 60%, respectively, over the next 12 months.\n\nThe contenders\n\nWall Street is more optimistic about Microsoft. The average price target for the tech giant reflects an upside potential of more than 10%. One analyst predicts that Microsoft's shares could jump more than 30% over the next 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft stands to profit from the AI boom in two key ways. The company has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model throughout its software applications. This added functionality will likely attract more customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also the second-biggest cloud services provider with its Azure platform. Organizations are flocking to the cloud to build and deploy AI apps, especially ones focused on generative AI.\n\nHowever, analysts think Alphabet could outperform Microsoft, AMD, and Nvidia over the near term. The average 12-month price target for the stock is roughly 15% above the current price. The most bullish analyst expects Alphabet stock to vault nearly 30% higher.\n\nWhat about the recent embarrassment for Alphabet with Google Gemini creating inaccurate images of historical figures? Wall Street doesn't believe it will be more than a temporary speed bump. Like Microsoft, Google has integrated generative AI throughout many of its products. Google Cloud should also continue to benefit from the adoption of AI.\n\nWall Street's favorite\n\nThat leaves one big AI stock Wall Street likes the most. Amazon's average 12-month price target reflects an upside potential of nearly 17%. The company's biggest fan in the analyst community thinks the stock could move close to 30% higher.\n\nAI stands out as one key growth driver for the company. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the leading market share in cloud services and enjoys the same AI tailwind as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\n\nAnalysts also recognize how much Amazon's focus on improving profitability and free cash flow is paying off. The e-commerce and cloud services giant's Q4 earnings jumped to $10.6 billion from $0.3 billion in the prior-year period. Free cash flow improved to $36.8 billion for the trailing 12 months, compared to negative free cash flow of $11.6 billion in the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nIs Wall Street right that Amazon will be the biggest winner of these five AI stocks over the next 12 months? Maybe. I agree that Amazon's momentum should continue.\n\nOver the long run, though, I expect that AMD, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia will keep up their winning ways. We could look back 20 years from now and still be able to say that the one thing investors needed to know to make a lot of money was to buy large-cap AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Finally Time to Take Profits in Nvidia?",
        "content": "One of the leaders of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is surging along with interest in generative AI.\n\nShares of Nvidia have soared 280% over the last year. Given the unrelenting momentum pushing the stock higher, some investors might be wondering if it's time to take some profits.\n\nLet's dig into the full story surrounding Nvidia to determine if trimming your position makes sense.\n\nNvidia's train is moving at full speed, but...\n\nLast year was a milestone for Nvidia. The company increased its revenue by 126%, all while expanding its margins and increasing cash flow sixfold. With such a dominant performance and an optimistic outlook, it's not surprising that investors have poured into the stock. And to add some color here, Nvidia has added $1 trillion of market cap to its valuation in less than two months.\n\nThat is a rise of epic proportions. Nvidia is now the world's third-most-valuable company, sitting behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe recent momentum pushing shares higher is likely causing some investors to consider taking profits. I don't blame them, but as an investor in Nvidia myself, I'm going to share why I see even better days ahead. Image Source: Getty Images\n\n...it could easily kick into another gear\n\nInvestors should realize that the majority of Nvidia's growth last year stemmed from its computing and networking business. But outside of GPUs and data center services, it has loads of opportunity.\n\nThe company ended 2023 with $26 billion in cash on the balance sheet, double what it had at the end of 2022. Over the last several months, it has been aggressively investing in new areas in AI that it can use to complement its hardware operation.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia invested in two different software businesses: voice-recognition company SoundHound AI, and big data analytics start-up Databricks. I see these as particularly savvy moves. AI-powered voice control is an area where many of Nvidia's big tech cohorts have demonstrated an interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft have all invested in this technology and deployed it across their respective lines of smart-home and personal-computing products. Considering that the addressable market for voice-recognition applications is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the decade, Nvidia's moves in this lesser-known pocket of AI are understandable.\n\nAnother area where Nvidia is investing is robotics. The company recently joined Microsoft, Intel, and OpenAI in a funding round for Figure AI, which is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in manufacturing, warehousing, and retailing.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that humanoid robotics could be a $38 billion market by 2035. Nvidia's GPU hardware coupled with its fast-growing software services business puts the company in a unique position to help move Figure AI's ambitions further along in more ways than one.\n\nIs now the time to take some profits?\n\nAll of the investments outlined above tell me one thing: Nvidia's journey isn't over. The company is planning for the future and is not sitting on its hardware cash cow.\n\nThis is why I am optimistic about the company. Yes, the stock has gone parabolic, and many investors are likely up a significant amount of money. But selling a stock simply because the price changed isn't sound financial judgment, it's emotional.\n\nI understand that taking some profits is tempting at the moment. There are a lot of unknowns regarding AI -- like emerging developers and potential regulatory actions. Also, the moves that the Federal Reserve will or won't make this year are a mystery at best, and this can add to market volatility in the short term.\n\nBut investors should be thinking about the long-term implications here. The artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is just beginning, and it would behoove investors to continue monitoring the next several chapters of the story. For these reasons, I would continue holding Nvidia as it remains one of the strongest opportunities in AI at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently hit another record high on the continued strength of artificial intelligence and with some significant help from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's relentless climb. Nvidia now makes up 5% of the index, and its market cap blasted through the $2 trillion mark, making it worth more than Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) for the first time, as shown below. AMZN Market Cap Chart\n\nNvidia could continue the charge higher. It's a tremendous company (albeit an expensive stock). But investors shouldn't overlook Amazon. Here are my four top reasons why Amazon stock is worth buying like there is no tomorrow.\n\n1. AWS is seeing a resurgence\n\nThere was much handwringing last year as Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth slowed to 13%, after growing 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021. Revenue eclipsed $90 billion for the year, but some speculated that the golden age of cloud computing growth was over. This is premature, and I expect growth to accelerate this year.\n\nDeclining data usage budgets were a massive obstacle in 2023. Businesses hunkered down for a recession that never came, and Amazon actively assisted its customers in lowering their data usage costs. Budgets are likely to loosen this year as fears of a recession ease. While this headwind fades, a new tailwind emerges. Much of AWS' sales are usage-based (much like a utility), so the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) software should spur growth because of the massive data needs.\n\nInvestors and analysts will watch AWS closely this year. A resurgence in growth could be a catalyst for the stock.\n\n2. Amazon's free cash flow is back\n\nEconomic stimulus during the pandemic's height pushed Amazon's free cash flow (the amount of money left after paying for expenses and fixed assets) to record highs, but multiple challenges saw it plunge in 2022. There were snarls at the ports, a shortage of workers, and record inflation, all of which caused increases in costs.\n\nAWS was also a victim of its own success. The massive growth meant massive investments in equipment (CapEx) were needed. Amazon spent a combined $125 billion on CapEx in 2021 and 2022, compared to $57 billion in 2020 and 2021. That is a ton of cash, even for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese challenges ironed themselves out in 2023, and free cash flow roared back, as you can see below. AMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAmazon will surely use the cash to invest in growth, but it could also institute a share buyback program if it chooses.\n\n3. Amazon's advertising segment impresses\n\nOne of Amazon's fastest-growing revenue streams is online revenue, which includes product placement, pay-per-click, and video. Advertisers are eager to purchase these spots because they know that the ads are reaching customers who are actively looking to buy. If you are like me, you rarely scroll past the first page, and sellers know it. Advertising sales have exploded, going from $13 billion in 2019 to $46 billion in 2023.\n\nThis marked the first time ad sales beat out Prime subscription sales ($47 billion versus $40 billion). The segment should also benefit from loosening budgets in 2024. This is another terrific, growing revenue stream for Amazon.\n\n4. Consumer sentiment is on the upswing\n\nYou can count me among those who thought rising interest rates and slowing economic stimulus would crimp consumer spending. But there are few signs that consumers are pulling back. In fact, consumer sentiment, widely considered the leading indicator of consumer spending, is rising steadily, as shown below. US Index of Consumer Sentiment Chart\n\nThe number is still below pre-pandemic levels but has climbed impressively while inflation declines. This is excellent news because consumer spending is critical to Amazon's e-commerce business. Speaking of inflation, it has dropped to 3.2%. This shows that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes are taming inflation, and the economy is still growing. We aren't quite out of the woods yet, but so far, so good.\n\nAmazon stock has risen significantly over the last year, but it trades at a discount to its 5-year averages based on sales and operating cash flow. The tailwinds above make it an excellent long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Dropped Great News for Super Micro Computer Stock",
        "content": "Share prices of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) took off in the past year, gaining 1,180% as of this writing, and a big reason behind the stock's red-hot surge is the booming demand for Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards.\n\nSupermicro's modular server rack-scale systems are being used to mount AI-related graphics cards from Nvidia, as well as other chipmakers. As the demand for Nvidia's cards has increased, Supermicro has also witnessed a terrific jump in demand for its server solutions, leading to rapid growth in the company's top and bottom lines. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAnd now, a recent revelation from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggests that Supermicro's eye-popping growth will continue.\n\nNvidia's adoption of liquid-cooled systems should give Super Micro Computer a boost\n\nNvidia's current flagship AI graphics card, the H100, reportedly performs well under air cooling. What's more, the upcoming H200 processor is also anticipated to perform optimally while being air-cooled, according to Tom's Hardware. But at an economic summit at Stanford this week, Huang said that one of Nvidia's next-generation computers is going to be liquid-cooled.\n\nNvidia's next-generation AI graphics processing units (GPUs) based on the Blackwell architecture are expected to consume 40% more power than the existing offerings based on the Hopper architecture. According to some other claims, Nvidia's next-generation AI chips could even consume double the power of the current lineup. This is where liquid-cooled server systems are going to come into the picture.\n\nWhen launching what Supermicro claimed to be the first liquid-cooled server systems for Nvidia's H100 processors last year, the company said:\n\nSavings for a data center are estimated to be 40% for power when using Supermicro liquid cooling solutions compared to an air-cooled data center. In addition, up to 86% reduction in direct cooling costs compared to existing data centers may be realized.\n\nStory continues\n\nA look at third-party studies suggests something similar. Liquid cooling reportedly consumes just 20% of the energy required for air cooling. In other words, liquid cooling is known to reduce energy consumption in data centers significantly, while also helping reduce operating expenses by using less water than air-cooled data centers.\n\nSupermicro seems to have been ahead of the curve, as it took the initiative to launch liquid-cooling solutions for Nvidia's AI chips last year. The company is now working to boost the manufacturing capacity of liquid-cooled server racks. On its January earnings conference call, Supermicro management remarked: \"By this June quarter, we will have high-volume, dedicated capacity for manufacturing 100-kilowatt to 120-kilowatt racks with liquid-cooling capabilities, providing DLC, direct liquid cooling racks capacity, up to 1,500 racks per month, and our total rack production capacity will be up to 5,000 racks per month by then.\"\n\nThe company's focus on expanding its capacity of liquid-cooled servers will not only let it take advantage of Nvidia's power-hungry AI chips but also allow it to make a dent in the fast-growing market for liquid-cooled data centers as a whole. The liquid-cooled data center market is expected to generate annual revenue of $40 billion in 2033, compared with just $4.5 billion last year, clocking an annual growth rate of 24% over the next decade.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Supermicro maintaining its healthy pace of growth for a long time to come.\n\nThe stock's valuation makes buying it a no-brainer\n\nThough Supermicro has been on a tear on the stock market over the past year, its sales multiple stands at just 6.7. That's cheaper than the technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7.1. Moreover, Supermicro's forward earnings multiple of 36 points toward a big jump in its bottom line, considering its trailing earnings multiple of 84.\n\nAs the following chart suggests, Supermicro's earnings are set to take off big time from the previous fiscal year's reading of $11.81 per share. SMCI EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIt's also worth noting that analysts have raised their earnings growth expectations from the company, and there's a good chance that they may keep raising those estimates considering added catalysts such as the growing demand for liquid-cooled systems. That's why now would be a good time for investors to buy this AI stock, as it seems capable of sustaining its stunning rally in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Can Nvidia Rally 21% and Surpass Apple to Become the Second Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock?",
        "content": "March 8 was a wild day in the stock market. Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) surged to an all-time high of $974 only to fall over 10% from that high to end the day at $875.28. At the peak, Nvidia was less than 9% away from surpassing Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in market cap. By close, it was a little over 20% away.\n\nGiven Nvidia's big swings, it seems like the stock could very well surpass Apple to become the second most valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" stock behind Microsoft. Here's why Nvidia could keep outperforming Apple in the short term, but why Apple is the better long-term buy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEarnings are driving the Nvidia story\n\nNvidia is not an unprofitable growth stock that is rallying based on optimism and greed alone (although those are contributing factors). The business is doing phenomenally well, achieving a level of sales and earnings growth paired with margin expansion. NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThe only concern with Nvidia is its valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio based on its trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings is 73.6. But consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) to more than double from the $11.90 it earned in fiscal 2024 to $24.50 in fiscal 2025. That gives Nvidia a forward P/E of 35.7 -- which is far more reasonable.\n\nThe easiest way for Nvidia to pass Apple in market cap is for investors to keep bidding up the stock. But the more realistic way is if Nvidia's earnings live up to expectations.\n\nNvidia will report its full-year fiscal 2025 results some time in late February or early March next year. If it reports $24.50 in earnings, the stock would likely be far higher, especially if there is optimism for even more growth ahead. A business that is more than doubling earnings with high margins and leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution deserves a premium valuation, probably something like double the P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia deserves the highest P/E of all the Magnificent Seven companies, but the company is nearing a point where it is running up too far, too fast.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia benefited from earnings growth and a valuation expansion. It's hard to assume the valuation will continue to expand, but the stock could still go up if the first half of fiscal 2025 goes as analysts expect. Each new quarter of high earnings will increase the trailing-12-month number and lower the P/E, leaving room for the stock to rise to fill the gap. There is nothing better in the stock market than earnings growth, and right now Nvidia has it, and Apple doesn't.\n\nBuying Apple when it is out of favor has historically been a genius move\n\nSo why is Apple the better buy if Nvidia has such an easy path forward? Simply put, I think the setup for Apple makes it a much better investment. Nvidia may be the better trade, but a more surefire way of building wealth is by compounding over the long term.\n\nMarket sentiment is negative toward Apple. So negative, in fact, that Apple trades at a discount to the S&P 500. The only reason that should ever happen is if something serious was going wrong with Apple. The company has its challenges, but none of them warrant an underperformance like we have been seeing for the last six months or so.\n\nThe abridged version of why Apple stock is under pressure is because it hasn't captured the spotlight with some major AI monetization announcement (Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms have). iPhone sales are down in China, and growth is sluggish in general. But Apple has endured these periods before and overcome competition.\n\nPiper Sandler's fall 2023 survey found that 87% of Gen Z had an iPhone, 88% expected their next phone to be an iPhone, and 34% owned an Apple Watch. The iPhone is essentially a consumer staple in the U.S. and is growing well across international markets outside of China.\n\nInvestors should focus less on the competition and more on Apple's ability to further monetize its existing devices through services and AI. The key for Apple has always been to increase the depth (services) and breadth (more products like phones, computers, tablets, wearables, ear buds, and more) of its ecosystem. Having lifetime customers consistently increase their spending relies on product improvements.\n\nThe pressure is on Apple to make a splash this summer to drive iPhone demand and upgrades. If Apple delivers the improvements that drive growth, the stock could soar. But even if it doesn't, it generates plenty of extra cash to make an acquisition and grow that way, or return cash to shareholders while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.\n\nApple's brand, market position, and financial health give it the time and the wiggle room needed to make mistakes. The company is known for not leading investors on and only makes announcements when it feels the product or service is ready.\n\nApple has a better risk/reward profile than Nvidia\n\nNvidia has to hit sky-high earnings forecasts to keep going up. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, and a downturn in customer spending could stall its growth trajectory. Nvidia may keep growing at a breakneck pace in the near term, but eventually, it will slow down. When that time comes, investors may be less willing to give Nvidia a multiple that is triple the market average.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is already a good value and has a clear path toward regaining Wall Street's favor.\n\nI don't have a crystal ball, but if I had to guess, I would say Nvidia will briefly become more valuable than Apple. But three to five years from now, I think Apple will be worth more than Nvidia while also being a safer and less volatile investment.\n\nNvidia stands out as a high-risk/high-potential-reward play, while Apple is more like a low-risk/medium-potential-reward investment. Investors who are confident about sustained high demand for Nvidia's products will want to watch each quarterly earnings report, understanding the importance earnings play in the story. The big gains have already been made in Nvidia, and investors should expect more reasonable returns going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia",
        "content": "Software company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) and chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. Both stocks are up over 240% over the past year and have fierce loyalty among investors.\n\nIs one artificial intelligence (AI) stock better than the other? To find out, I compared them head-to-head to see why they're thriving and whether they can continue. It was a very close race, but one stood out just ahead of the other.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nMeeting these two very different companies\n\nBoth stocks soared due to the fantastic performance of their underlying businesses. However, these two AI companies are very different. Nvidia spent years specializing in high-performance GPUs, which became ideal for data centers and AI. Nvidia's high-quality products and CUDA software, which helps customers efficiently use their GPUs power, have led to Nvidia grabbing an early stranglehold on the AI chip market -- an estimated 80% to 90%.\n\nOn the other hand, Palantir builds custom software applications for both government and commercial applications. It runs three software platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP for AI applications. You can think of Palantir as an operating system that helps organizations use their data. The company's intent is that it augments human intelligence; it doesn't replace it.\n\nA closer look at each company's growth\n\nFrom a pure numbers standpoint, Nvidia is growing leaps and bounds faster than Palantir. You can see below how both companies began accelerating revenue growth in mid-2023, but Nvidia soared on massive data center spending from big technology customers, mainly in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" It could be fair to wonder how long this enormous boost in data center spending from big tech will continue.\n\nOne possibility is that these companies start producing custom chips in-house, weaning themselves off of Nvidia's. That could hurt long-term growth for a company currently getting most of its revenue from a small handful of customers.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nSpeaking of Palantir, the company is not as explosive as Nvidia. But what impresses me is the company's expanding customer base. Palantir's U.S. customer count grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% quarter over quarter. Customers come in all shapes and sizes, so it's not a precise translation. Such customer growth bodes well for long-term revenue growth.\n\nMaybe Nvidia's customer concentration won't matter, and Nvidia's chips will maintain their market share. Still, I'd like to see customer expansion like Palantir's.\n\nWhat's the better bang for your buck?\n\nAnalysts expect significant earnings growth from both companies moving forward. On a forward basis, that makes both stocks cheaper than you would guess after both of their 200% runs. I like using the PEG ratio to compare how much I pay for a company's earnings growth. The lower the PEG ratio, the better, and I would like to spend under 1.5 if I can.\n\nNvidia fits that criteria with a PEG ratio of just over 1. Palantir doesn't quite fit, with its PEG ratio of 1.6. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNvidia is handily the better value today, based on each company's expected long-term earnings growth. Of course, the caveat is whether each company will perform up to expectations.\n\nThe verdict is...\n\nBoth companies are excellent AI stocks and leaders in their respective areas. Both are accelerating their revenue growth. Naturally, analysts are very optimistic about each company's earnings growth moving forward. Whichever company you believe is more likely to meet growth expectations over the next three to five years is probably your winner.\n\nThis Fool is giving Palantir a slight edge. Why?\n\nPalantir gets roughly half its revenue from government contracts. The company's long history with the government could put a bit of a floor into Palantir's business, plus the upside from expanding its customer base. Meanwhile, Nvidia's customer concentration could be problematic if a significant customer opts for another chip.\n\nWhile the numbers say Nvidia is the better buy, there's an argument that investors can trust Palantir's long-term growth slightly more, especially when looking at the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "There are only six trillion-dollar stocks worldwide, every one of which is a popular name. And they all rightfully sit at the top of their sectors.\n\nThere’s a certain allure to reaching $1 trillion, and investors are always looking for the next one to breach that valuation. Yet, achieving that kind of market cap requires expert management, multiple and growing revenue streams. Additionally, it demands a realistic, overarching vision of the company’s development in the short and long term.\n\nLuck and the occasional massive swings in market sentiment and investor interest indeed play a part in increasing valuations. Putting those aside, though, a handful of companies have the potential to join the list of trillion-dollar stocks, either through solid financial foundations, sheer market dominance, or a reputation as a reliable provider for a burgeoning sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s talk about the next trillion-dollar stocks and the reasons you should consider investing in them now.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is an excellent example of the benefits of diversification. This multinational holding company’s primary focus is insurance (divided into underwriting and investments). And it has interests in many industries and markets, including railroad, energy, gas station chains, retail supplies, and manufacturing. Most importantly, Warren Buffet, arguably the most popular investment investor of the 21st century, heads it up.\n\nAfter ending 2022 at a net loss, 2023’s year-end report is a breath of fresh air for the company. Insurance revenue grew 5%, while revenue from all the other segments and markets nearly doubled year over year (YOY). Meanwhile, the most significant turnaround came from investment and derivatives, which recorded a $74.86 billion gain from last year’s $67.89 billion loss.\n\nThis success hasn’t gone unnoticed by the larger investing public. In fact, shares of BRK-B peaked at an all-time high of $430 on February 26, 2024, bringing its total valuation to more than $900 billion. Currently, the company is the closest one to breach the $ 1 trillion mark. This could be a novel development, as Berkshire Hathaway would be the first non-tech U.S. company to join the $1T club.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn his annual letter to investors, Warren Buffet tempered expectations about massive growth in the short term. However, he had no reservations in expressing his company’s resiliency.\n\n“I believe Berkshire can handle financial disasters of a magnitude beyond any heretofore experienced,” he stated, outlining the company’s strong financial position and many diversified investments.\n\nBRK-B’s financial statement backs up his claim, having a record $167.64 billion in cash and cash equivalents in 2023, including short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills.\n\n“Berkshire,” Buffet said, “is built to last.”\n\nEli Lilly and Company (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is currently the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world, boasting a market capitalization that exceeds $750 billion. While mostly known for diabetes and clinical depression medication, the company offers more than 50 different drugs to the global market.\n\nLLY’s latest report showcased an impressive $2.19 billion revenue growth to $2.49 billion from new products, primarily led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. This represents roughly 26% percent of its total revenue. Additionally, quarterly revenue ended at $9.35 billion, representing a 28% growth YOY. Meanwhile, GAAP EPS came in flat with analyst expectations, ending at $2.42, or a 13% YOY increase.\n\nAs mentioned, one of its most notable products is Zepbound, a weight-loss injection that got massive coverage upon its recent FDA approval. So far, the drug has generated $175.8 million in its first selling quarter, with more growth foreseen as LLY accelerates production and distribution.\n\nLike the company itself, analysts are confident about Zepbound’s prospects. Morgan Stanley expects $2.2 billion in revenue for 2024, while Bank of America laid out a more optimistic $2.7 billion. Other notable drugs are Verzenio, which recorded the highest quarterly dollar value growth YOY, and Tyvyt, which nearly doubled in revenue. With such a high potential for growth, many investors think that LLY is about to join the list of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe pandemic chip shortage during Covid-19 was a curious event.\n\nChip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) saw their market caps balloon as investors flocked to take a piece of the massive shortage demands.\n\nTSM breached the $700B mark in 2022, but soon prices fell back. Yet, they remained well above their pre-pandemic levels. Now, prices are approaching their pandemic highs, and TSM’s market cap is around $656 billion.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I’m bullish on TSM reaching trillion-dollar stock status is its client base. The company mass-produces integrated circuits for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). More important clients include the trillion-dollar companies of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Furthermore, TSM’s 3-nanometer N3 chips are the de facto leader in the industry. The company is gearing up to produce 2nm N2 chips, expected to arrive in 2025.\n\nThe chip shortage may be over, but the accelerating demand for AI is still driving growth in the tech sector.

        "title": "Have $1,000? These 2 Stocks Could Be Bargain Buys for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The stock market has gotten off to a solid start in 2024 with the S&P 500 index already up by close to 8% and setting new highs, and the good part is that the market could keep rising thanks to a strong U.S. economy and receding inflation.\n\nTechnology stocks, in particular, could have another solid year on the back of catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI). It is worth noting that the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has jumped by more than 62% in the past year, so it may be difficult to find bargains in this sector. But if you have $1,000 to spare after paying your bills, saving enough for a rainy day, and paying off high-interest debt, you may want to use that investible cash to buy one share of each of these two tech companies that look like solid buys right now based on their long-term prospects.\n\n1. Twilio\n\nCloud communications specialist Twilio(NYSE: TWLO) may look like a surprising buy recommendation considering that it has underperformed the stock market in the past year, losing 18% of its value. There was more bad news for Twilio investors when the company released its fourth-quarter results last month.\n\nThough it beat expectations for the quarter and its revenue for the year rose 9% to $4.15 billion, management failed to provide full-year guidance for 2024. The company is carrying out an operational review of its customer data platform business, known as Segment, and says it plans to issue the 2024 guidance this month once that review is complete.\n\nHowever, a closer look at Twilio's guidance for the current quarter indicates that this is going to be a difficult year for the company. It expects just 2% to 3% revenue growth in the quarter to $1.03 billion. Twilio has also guided for adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share at the midpoint, which would be a 23% jump from the prior-year period. For comparison, Twilio's full-year earnings increased to $2.45 per share in 2023 from just $0.15 per share in 2022, driven mainly by its cost-cutting moves.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe relatively slower growth forecast for 2024 explains why some investors have been selling Twilio stock. As a result, it can now be bought for just 2.7 times sales, which is well below its five-year average sales multiple of 6.5. Additionally, Twilio is trading at 24 times forward earnings right now, which makes it cheaper than the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for the tech sector).\n\nBuying Twilio at these multiples could turn out to be a smart long-term move. That's because the company's slowdown is likely to be temporary considering the communications-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) industry that it operates in. Twilio's application programming interfaces (APIs) allow companies to build voice, messaging, and video applications to remain connected with their customers. This allows organizations to do without old-school physical call centers, which require a lot of initial investment.\n\nAs of October 2023, Synergy Research Group describes Twilio as the leading player in CPaaS with a 37% market share. Meanwhile, as of June 2023, market research firm IDC estimates that Twilio controls nearly a quarter of this market. IDC further adds that \"despite the setbacks of slowing sales cycles, restructuring, and downsizing, the industry is still one of the strongest IT sectors with attainable double-digit and profitable growth in reach of many companies.\"\n\nThis explains why the CPaaS market is predicted to generate almost $30 billion in revenue in 2026 compared to $14 billion in 2022. As such, it won't be surprising to see Twilio's growth pick up once again in the next couple of years. And, if the company continues to control a quarter of the CPaaS market in 2026, its revenue could increase to $7.5 billion based on IDC's forecast.\n\nThat would translate into a three-year revenue compound annual growth rate of nearly 22% based on Twilio's 2023 revenue. If Twilio maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 2.7, its market cap could increase to $20 billion in the next three years. That would be a nice jump from the current level of almost $11 billion.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may seem like another surprising pick for investors on the hunt for bargain stocks. It trades at 33 times sales and 69 times trailing earnings following its 244% stock surge in the past year. By those measures, it looks pricey. However, Nvidia's forward multiples tell a different story. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAs the chart above indicates, Nvidia's forward earnings and sales multiples have come down rapidly of late. That's not surprising, as the company's top and bottom lines are predicted to rise sharply this year. Analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to jump to $24.43 per share in fiscal 2025 from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. Its top line is forecast to increase almost 80% to $109.5 billion.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia seems capable of sustaining these impressive growth rates beyond 2024. Analyst Vijay Rakesh of Japanese investment bank Mizuho estimates that Nvidia could generate $300 billion in revenue from AI chips by 2027. That would be a massive increase over the $47.5 billion revenue that it generated from its data center business last year by selling AI chips, which was a handsome 217% increase from the prior year.\n\nThere are a few reasons why it wouldn't be absurd to see Nvidia's revenue grow at such a breathtaking pace over the next three years. First, Nvidia's peer AMD has forecast that the global AI chip market will generate $400 billion in annual revenue by 2027. Second, Nvidia is in a nice position to make the most of this opportunity as it reportedly commands a whopping 90% of this market.\n\nAlso, Nvidia's efforts to move into additional niches of the AI chip market could eventually help it get close to the ambitious revenue target that Mizuho has set for it. All this indicates that Nvidia could turn out to be a top growth stock in 2024 and beyond, and its low forward multiples mean that investors are getting a good deal on it right now.\n\nAnother thing worth noting here is that Nvidia has justified its valuation in the past year by clocking stunning earnings growth that has outpaced the growth in its price-to-earnings ratio. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAs such, Nvidia stock looks like a bargain considering the potential growth on offer, which is why savvy investors should consider buying it before it moves higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most",
        "content": "In this article, we will be analyzing the population dynamics in the US and the 15 US cities where the population decreased the most. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most.\n\nPopulation Dynamics in the US\n\nThe United States ranks among the most populous countries worldwide. As reported by the US Census Bureau, the country’s population is 336,167,022, as of March 14. Region-wise, the South accounted for 38.9% of the population growth in 2023. Population growths of 23.6% for the West, 20.6% for the Midwest, and 17% for the Northeast were reported in 2023. Some of the most populous US states include California, Texas, Florida, and New York. You can also take a look at the most densely populated cities in the US.\n\n2022 showed the first signs of US recovery from the global pandemic in terms of population growth. This was when the US population was reported to have increased by 0.4%. The primary driver of this growth was the net international migration which added 1,010,923 people to the national population.\n\nFuture prediction represents a slow-paced population growth for the country over the coming years. On November 9, 2023, the US Census Bureau reported that the US population has been forecasted to approach almost 370 million in 2080 before moving downward to 366 million in 2100. It has been projected that immigration will be the largest contributing factor to the US population growth. Simultaneously, a natural decrease in the country’s population will be supported by declining fertility rates and an aging population. The reduced fertility rates will also impact the nation’s age structure, leading to more adults aged 65 and above as compared to children under the age of 18.\n\nDeclining Populations: Past Trends and Future Projections\n\nOne year into the pandemic, the US Census Bureau reported that some of the fastest-growing US cities during the pre-pandemic period, witnessed slower growth rates after the pandemic. Population growth especially slowed in the cities of Leander in Texas and Meridian in Idaho.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to the fastest declining cities, San Fransisco ranked at the top in 2021 when it was not even a part of the list in 2019. Even for the city of Cupertino which had been a declining city in both 2019 and 2021, the drop in its population growth was almost triple. Overall, six of the top fifteen declining cities were based in California. The largest numeric decrease in population was recorded in New York City, San Fransisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles.\n\nA recent study reveals that almost half of the 30,000 US cities will be subject to depopulation by 2100. This study initially began as a project commissioned by the Illinois Department of Transportation to carry out an analysis of the challenges in transportation that could arise from population changes in Illinois. However, a deeper analysis showed that the biggest population losses will be taking place in the Northeast and Midwest of the country as the population moves to the South and West. States such as Texas and Utah where the population tends to be growing as of now, will be seeing a fair share of their cities undergoing depopulation in the future. The population will also be declining in the cities situated in Illinois, Mississippi, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Michigan. Overall, some sort of depopulation has been forecasted for all US states except for the District of Columbia and Hawaii.\n\nBusiness in the Depopulating State of California\n\nCalifornia is home to a majority of cities where the population has decreased the most in recent years. It is an important US state in terms of business as well. The state boasts a robust technology sector. Some of the dominant technology firms in California include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Let’s take a look at what these firms have been up to. Some of the biggest California companies and stocks have also been previously discussed.\n\nThe tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is headquartered in Cupertino, California. Recently, the company made a development in the laptop space and launched a new and  more powerful MacBook Air. On March 4, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that the new 13- and 15‑inch MacBook Air will be available beginning March 8. Using the powerful M3 chip, the MacBook Air tends to be up to 60% faster than the model having an M1 chip. It also ranks as the world’s best consumer laptop for AI while allowing up to 18 hours of battery life. Based on the improved performance and features, the 13-inch model serves as the bestselling laptop globally while the 15-inch model is the bestselling 15-inch laptop around the world.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) offers more than 100 AI-enabled solutions under its artificial intelligence portfolio. On March 7, the company unveiled the industry’s largest portfolio of AI PCs. This includes HP Elite PCs which serve as the leading business laptops for collaboration in the world, and Z by HP mobile workstations. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) has also announced program enhancements for channel partners under which they will now be capable of accessing the first role-based AI partner training and certification program.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is another California-based technology company that is enabling the penetration of generative AI, an emerging tech trend. On March 7, the company reported the introduction of a new professional certification in generative AI. Developers and professionals can polish their proficiency in AI through this professional certification program from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which encompasses two associate-level generative AI certifications. The certification will focus on large language models and multimodal workflow skills. You can also take a look at the fastest-growing technology companies in the US.\n\nNow that we have navigated through the population dynamics in the US, depopulating cities and their business potential, we can move to the 15 US cities where populations decreased the most. 15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most\n\n15 US Cities Where Populations Decreased the Most\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 15 US cities where populations decreased the most, we sourced data from the US Census Bureau. For our rankings, we focused on cities that recorded the most recent population declines. Hence, we acquired the city-wise population estimates for 2020 and 2022.

        "title": "Nvidia Trades Near All-Time Highs: Is the Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "Euphoria surrounding the possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is pushing the stock market to record levels. While there are many companies shaping the AI narrative, I would argue that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is cast in the lead role.\n\nThe company's breakthroughs in compute networking are impacting a multitude of AI applications, including machine learning, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs). Nvidia is currently the nucleus of most systems powering modern AI tools, and investors have been cheering on the stock. Over the last year, shares have surged by 265%.\n\nWith Nvidia stock hovering in the vicinity of the all-time high it set earlier this month, some investors may be wondering if they've missed out on the chance to profit. My stance? Given all the moves Nvidia is making and the ways it's setting itself up for long-term growth, now is as lucrative a time as ever to scoop up some shares.\n\nA meteoric rise\n\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's quarterly revenues, gross profits, and free cash flows over the last decade. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNot only are sales skyrocketing, but Nvidia's commanding position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and data center business has provided the company with unparalleled pricing power. This has helped it expand its margins materially -- improvements that flow directly to the bottom line.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia increased its free cash flow sixfold. Unsurprisingly, this level of growth has brought Nvidia onto the radar of more investors. Ultimately, this has resulted in more buying activity -- leading to an eye-popping addition of $1 trillion to Nvidia's market cap in less than two months. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has loads of cash, and it's not afraid to spend it\n\nPowered by its record performance in 2023, Nvidia has doubled the cash position on its balance sheet to $26 billion. While this is impressive, what I find more encouraging is how Nvidia is allocating its capital.\n\nThe company is showing a keen interest in AI software applications. Namely, the company has investments in voice-recognition company SoundHound AI as well as data analytics start-up Databricks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough it primarily develops hardware, Nvidia is quietly making inroads into enterprise software. Its software services business reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion last year -- a great milestone, but still much smaller than its $47 billion compute networking business.\n\nNvidia also joined Microsoft, OpenAI, Intel, and Jeff Bezos in a recent funding round for a start-up called Figure AI, which is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in manufacturing, warehousing, and even retail settings.\n\nNvidia stands to benefit from this relationship in several ways. Specifically, it is uniquely positioned to help further the development of Figure AI's bots from both a hardware and software standpoint.\n\nThe stock is expensive, but worth the premium\n\nIn the wake of the surge in Nvidia's stock, the company's valuation multiples have become a bit extended. Shares trade at 77 times trailing-12-month earnings. Moreover, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 is nearly double that of the S&P 500.\n\nDespite its ultra-premium valuation, I see Nvidia's stock as a solid opportunity for long-term investors. At a macro level, heavy secular tailwinds fuel AI budgets, and I don't expect those to abate anytime soon.\n\nBased on Nvidia's ability to market itself as both a hardware and software solution, as well as the potential of its savvy investments, I see its journey as just starting. Using dollar-cost averaging to gradually build a position in the stock would be a prudent strategy, helping to mitigate risk while providing you with exposure to the long-term upside of Nvidia and the AI realm.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Biden Xi Jinping\n\nChinese AI experts are circumventing Joe Biden’s export bans to obtain advanced microchips, academic papers have shown.\n\nHigh-end AI chips made by the US tech giant Nvidia have been used by an employee at a blacklisted Beijing company as well as academics at China’s national science institute, according to studies published online.\n\nThe Biden administration has barred Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips in China amid a global race to develop powerful AI systems and concerns about possible military uses.\n\nHowever, four academic papers published on the open access science website ArXiv in recent weeks demonstrate experiments done in China using Nvidia’s H100, the company’s most powerful AI chip.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe studies include using AI systems to solve logic problems and carrying out tests of their mathematical ability.\n\nWhile the researchers are using the H100 chips in small numbers – eight chips or fewer, compared to the thousands that have been acquired by US tech giants - the studies show that they are having some success circumventing US controls.\n\nThe H100 was restricted before it went on sale last year, meaning it has never been legal to sell it to China without special exemptions. However, there is believed to be a thriving black market for the processors, which are far superior to those made in the country.\n\nOne study involving the chips published on ArXiv is co-authored by a researcher at 4paradigm, an AI company that was last year placed on an export control list by the US Commerce Department for attempting to acquire US technology to support China’s military.\n\nAnother researcher on the paper works at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the national research organisation. Other authors include researchers at key state laboratories, which receive funding from Beijing to support China’s technological development.\n\nThe US government banned the sale of the H100 and its predecessor, the A100, in 2022. Nvidia subsequently developed slower versions of the chips specifically designed for sale in the country but last year the Biden administration banned those as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the restrictions have not been watertight. Chinese government tender documents show orders for the advanced chips from suppliers in the country. There is no suggestion that Nvidia has sold the chips directly, in contravention of the export controls.\n\nNvidia’s AI chips are crucial to developing high-powered AI systems, a fact that has helped catapult the company to a $2.2 trillion (£1.7 trillion) valuation. While Chinese companies have developed their own alternatives, they are relatively underpowered.\n\nA paper published by ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, last month said that it was in the process of obtaining the “newest Nvidia GPUs [graphics units for AI]”, although this may refer to a new chip being developed for the Chinese market.\n\nA Nvidia spokesman said: “We don’t have information about those research projects or the servers they accessed. Our H100 products are not available in China.”",

        "title": "Jensen Huang Just Said \"Humanoid Robotics Should Be Right Around the Corner.\" Here's How Nvidia Could Benefit.",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), applications in machine learning, large language models, and compute networking garner most of the attention. But what investors may not realize is that use cases packaged around AI are evolving in real time.\n\nOne area that is getting particular interest is robotics. Indeed, companies such as Amazon and Alibaba have implemented robotics throughout their warehouses for years, creating efficiencies as it relates to packaging and logistics.\n\nHowever, a rising number of the world's largest technology companies are increasingly focusing on the next frontier of robotics: humanoid bots. In late February, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, said \"humanoid robotics should be right around the corner\" during a panel discussion about AI.\n\nLet's dig into the rise of humanoid robotics and analyze the moves Nvidia is making in the space.\n\nHow does AI play a role in robotics?\n\nRobotics is an interesting part of the overall AI narrative because it is uniquely positioned at the intersection of software and hardware. And believe it or not, there are lots of companies working to develop humanoid bots.\n\nTwo of the more recognized brands in robotics include Boston Dynamics and Tesla. Over the last year, Tesla has teased investors with previews of its humanoid bot Optimus -- which is planned to be used across the company's factories and assembly lines in the future.\n\nOne lesser-known robotics start-up called 1X hails from Norway. The company has raised $125 million in venture capital (VC) funding over the last year from high-profile investors including OpenAI, Samsung, and Tiger Global. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat is Nvidia doing with robotics?\n\nAbout a week after Huang's comments regarding humanoid robots, Nvidia was cited as an investor in a $675 million funding round for start-up Figure AI. Nvidia joined Microsoft, OpenAI, Intel, and Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos as investors.\n\nFigure AI is developing humanoid robots that it plans to commercialize in industries such as manufacturing, warehousing, and retail. Figure AI's robots are being trained on generative AI models to learn how to perform basic tasks. The theme? The company is seeking to disrupt the workforce -- a market estimated to be worth $42 trillion annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow could Nvidia benefit?\n\nNvidia has incredibly lucrative opportunities in robotics. Currently, the company is primarily a hardware player -- developing high-performance semiconductors called graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nHowever, Nvidia is quietly expanding outside compute networking. Specifically, the company's enterprise software and services business is already operating at an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. While this is impressive, it pales in comparison to Nvidia's data center business -- which generated $47 billion in sales last year.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is aggressively pursuing the enterprise software market through a combination of investments and strategic partnerships. The company is an investor in start-up Databricks, which largely competes with Palantir Technologies. Additionally, Nvidia also partners with Snowflake, helping bring AI capabilities to the company's data cloud platform.\n\nGiven Nvidia's distinctive position as both a hardware and software developer, the company has a massive opportunity to play an integral role in the development of humanoid robotics. I see the investment in Figure AI as a first step that could lead to further strategic partnerships and revenue opportunities across both sides of its business.\n\nThe important idea here is that Nvidia is subtly building an end-to-end AI solution -- spanning across both software and hardware. As such, I think the company is setting itself up for long-term sustained growth in a variety of areas in the overall AI realm.\n\nMy guess is that Huang will continue to drop breadcrumbs, alluding to AI-powered applications that he believes Nvidia can play a role in. Despite the run-up in the stock, I think now is a terrific time to scoop up some shares and plan to hold long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? Buy ASML Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's artificial intelligence (AI)-powered surge has sent its valuation to incredible levels, putting the chipmaker well out of reach of value investors looking to capitalize on the proliferation of this technology.\n\nNvidia's sales multiple of 36 and trailing earnings multiple of 73 are significantly higher than the technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7.2 and earnings multiple of 45. Of course, Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35 indicates that the semiconductor bellwether is on track to deliver terrific growth and could justify its expensive valuation.\n\nBut there is also a relatively inexpensive way for investors to ride the AI boom. Dutch semiconductor equipment company ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is not only cheaper than Nvidia, but it is also playing a critical role in the growth of AI. Let's look at the reasons why investors who have missed Nvidia's stunning rally over the past year would do well to buy ASML right now.\n\nAI is set to drive solid growth for ASML Holding\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) play a central role in training large language models, but making those GPUs wouldn't have been possible without ASML's machines. More specifically, Nvidia's flagship H100 AI GPU is manufactured using a custom 5-nanometer process node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC.\n\nHowever, TSMC can only manufacture these 5nm chips using ASML's machines. As it turns out, any semiconductor foundry that's looking to manufacture advanced chips made on process nodes that are 7nm or smaller will have to turn to ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. That's because ASML has a monopoly on the market for EUV lithography machines.\n\nThis puts the company in a solid position to make the most of the increasing demand for the advanced chipmaking equipment that will be needed to manufacture AI chips. According to third-party estimates, the EUV lithography market could clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% through 2032, generating $63 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. The overall semiconductor equipment market, meanwhile, is expected to generate a whopping $222 billion in revenue in 2032, up from $83 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML's massive order backlog makes it clear that it is well on its way to making the most of this multibillion-dollar opportunity. The company finished 2023 with a backlog of 39 billion euros. This impressive backlog was driven by a sharp jump in ASML's bookings last quarter. More specifically, ASML recorded net bookings of 9.2 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2023, a big jump over the 2.6 billion euros worth of bookings it received in the third quarter.\n\nThe company saw a sharp jump in orders last year, with its net bookings increasing by more than 50% to 30.7 billion euros from 20 billion euros in 2022. It is worth noting that 60% of the orders ASML received in the previous quarter were for EUV systems. That wasn't surprising, as chipmakers are scrambling to place orders for ASML's systems so that they can manufacture AI chips.\n\nThe company's robust order backlog is the reason why it is predicted to deliver robust growth over the next couple of years. ASML Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe stock's attractive valuation and potential growth make it a solid investment\n\nASML's healthy top-line growth explains why its earnings are predicted to increase at an annual rate of 22% for the next five years. Based on its 2023 earnings of $21.78 per share, ASML's bottom line could jump to just under $59 per share in 2028.\n\nUsing the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 31 as a proxy for tech stocks and multiplying it by ASML's projected earnings after five years points toward a stock price of $1,829. That would be a 90% increase from current levels. ASML currently trades at 46 times trailing earnings and 13 times sales, so it is significantly cheaper than Nvidia. This makes ASML an ideal bet for investors looking for a cheaper AI alternative to Nvidia, and they would do well to buy it before it soars further following 27% gains in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Stanley Druckenmiller Has 40% of His Portfolio in 3 AI Stocks. Are any of Them Buys?",
        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the most successful investors of all time.\n\nWorking under George Soros, Druckenmiller helped guide the strategy that \"broke the bank of England,\" making them more than a billion dollars in 1992 by shorting the British pound, leading to its crash.\n\nHowever, that trade wasn't a fluke. After starting Duquesne Capital Management in 1981, Druckenmiller's hedge fund never had a down year, a period that included the Black Monday crash, the dot-com bust, and the great financial crisis. Duquesne Capital Management averaged an annual return of 30% from 1986 to 2010, crushing the broad market.\n\nDruckenmiller closed his fund in 2010, but he didn't stop investing. Today, he runs the Duquesne Family Office, which has about $3.4 billion in assets as of its fourth-quarter update. Recently, the famed investor has been an outspoken bull on AI stocks. Like a number of other CEOs and investors, the billionaire sees it as a major innovation, saying last year, \"AI could be as transformative as the internet.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, AI stocks make up a sizable portion of his portfolio. In fact, just three AI stocks account for 40% of his holdings. Let's take a look at those stocks and see if any are worth buying today. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt might not be a surprise to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) at the top of this list. Nvidia has dominated the AI narrative, and it's been the biggest winner by market cap, up by more than $1.5 trillion since the start of 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Druckenmiller owned 617,494 shares worth roughly $306 million and call options on the stock worth another $242 million. Combined, those holdings make up 16% of his portfolio. Considering that Nvidia has soared since the start of the year, those options could have paid off handsomely for the billionaire investor.\n\nDruckenmiller began buying Nvidia in the fourth quarter of 2022, indicating that he jumped on the stock after ChatGPT was launched, which signaled the start of the AI boom. The investor said in the fall that Nvidia stock was in \"nosebleed territory,\" but shares have continued to rally, and his call buying in Q4 indicates he changed his mind on that synopsis, though he did cut his stake in Nvidia stock by 30% in Q4. It's unclear if he's sold any of his Nvidia stock in Q1 so far, but based on its current price, the right move would have been to hold onto it.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAfter Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) may be the next-best-known AI stock. The tech giant has been a close partner of ChatGPT parent OpenAI, having invested billions into the AI start-up, and that's given it an edge in the new technology. It's incorporated OpenAI features across its products, including Azure, GitHub, Bing, and its Office suite, and it's designed its own ChatGPT-like Copilot to answer questions, improve communications, and guide users.\n\nDruckenmiller isn't a newcomer to Microsoft. He first began buying the stock in 2015, and he added to his stake in Q4, buying 68,860 shares to bring the total to 1.09 million, or $408.4 million. Microsoft is his largest outright stock holding and accounts for 12% of his portfolio.\n\nNotably, in Q4, Druckenmiller dumped his entire stake in Alphabet, Microsoft's rival, indicating a clear preference for Microsoft. That decision seems to have paid off, as Microsoft is up 10% this year, while Alphabet is down slightly.\n\n3. Coupang\n\nSouth Korean e-commerce leader Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) may not be an AI stock in the traditional sense, but the company is doing things with artificial intelligence that earn it a place in the category.\n\nCoupang uses artificial intelligence in a variety of ways, including robots at its fulfillment center that can carry more than 2,000 pounds and are called autonomously guided vehicles as they direct themselves around the warehouse. They have cut the human workload by about 65%.\n\nCoupang also uses AI to help warehouse workers, giving each employee a personal digital assistant (PDA) that will assign work and optimize routes using AI and machine learning.\n\nDruckenmiller owned 22.9 million shares of Coupang as of the end of the year, adding 2 million shares to his holdings in Q4 to bring the total stake to $371 million, or 11% of his portfolio. He's owned the Korean e-commerce stock since before it went public. It's not fully clear why Druckenmiller is betting on Coupang, but the stock offers appealing growth at a good value right now.\n\nWhich of these AI stocks are buys?\n\nOf these three stocks, I think Nvidia and Microsoft look like solid buys. Yes, the shares have run up considerably over the last year, but these companies are the respective leaders in their segments of AI (Nvidia in hardware and Microsoft in software), and those leadership positions are likely to pay off in the coming years.\n\nCoupang seems promising as well but riskier. The company is delivering solid growth and trades at a reasonable valuation. However, its long-term growth seems to depend on expanding beyond South Korea and into new markets, as it's already heavily penetrated in its home market. That could pay off for the company, especially as \"developing offerings\" delivered 105% revenue growth to $273 million in Q4, but it's a riskier strategy.\n\nOverall, investors are better off sticking with Nvidia and Microsoft here. If you're an AI investor, it makes sense to follow Druckenmiller's comments and moves as the investing landscape develops. The billionaire called the Nvidia rally, and he may have some foresight into where the AI boom goes next.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year and became one of the biggest growth drivers of the Nasdaq Composite's recovery. The market faced an economic downturn the previous year, which sent countless stocks plunging. However, the Nasdaq Composite is up 44% year over year and climbing, primarily thanks to excitement over AI.\n\nAccording to data from Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. The industry hit nearly $200 billion last year, but this trajectory would see it achieve close to $2 trillion by the decade's end. So, despite the market's meteoric rise over the last year, new investors still have much to gain from AI.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks of the tech world -- Apple, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla -- are a great place to start. These companies are investing heavily in AI and have the brand power to go far in the industry. It's not too late to invest in AI, so here are two Magnificent Seven stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's business was brought front and center last year when it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training and running AI models. Meanwhile, competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up.\n\nSoaring demand for AI services led to a similar demand for high-powered chips, with Nvidia perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to most of the market. As a result, earnings hit record heights over the last year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended in January), Nvidia's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily from a 409% rise in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales.\n\nThe chipmaker's massive success in AI has also seen its free cash flow soar 430% in 12 months to $27 billion. Comparatively, AMD's is at just over $1 billion, while Intel's is negative $14 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\nAfter a monster growth year, some analysts are questioning whether Nvidia has much more to offer. However, the significant potential of AI and the company's powerful market position means it remains an attractive long-term play. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow plunged 45% and 48% over the last year, meaning the company's stock is trading at its best value in months.\n\nAlongside a solid role in AI, Nvidia is a Magnificent Seven stock that is too good to pass up.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nIt's impossible to deny Alphabet's top spot in tech, with brands like Android, YouTube, and Google attracting billions of users worldwide. The popularity of these products enabled Alphabet to achieve a leading 25% market share in digital advertising and become the world's sixth most valuable company by market cap.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on its expanding AI efforts over the last year. At the end of 2023, the company debuted Gemini, a large language model that looked likely to make Alphabet competitive against cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nYet the Google parent's stock was down 7% in the last month after a disappointing launch for Gemini. Alphabet recently held a presentation for the new AI model, and Gemini gave inaccurate depictions of historical figures and failed to recognize key differences between other prominent figures. The blunders forced Alphabet to take its AI image services offline for now.\n\nDespite recent failures, Alphabet remains an attractive way to invest in AI over the long haul. Last year, the company hit $70 billion in free cash flow, more than Microsoft or Amazon. The company has the financial resources to keep investing in its business and the brand power to attract users to its services. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nFurthermore, the table above shows that Alphabet has the lowest P/E and second-to-lowest price-to-free-cash-flow of all of the Magnificent Seven. As a result, Alphabet's stock is a bargain compared to its rivals, making it a lower-risk way to invest in AI.\n\nIn addition to a range of immensely popular brands, Alphabet is one of the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy now and hold forever.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could AMD Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price nearly quadrupled over the past 12 months as its clients ramped up their orders for its high-end data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to help them take on complex artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. The soaring popularity of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT caused the market's demand for new GPUs to outstrip its available supply, and analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue to surge 81% in fiscal 2025 (which ends in January 2025).\n\nNvidia's stock might still have plenty of room to run as the AI market expands, but its stock is getting a bit pricey at 37x forward earnings. With a market cap of $2.3 trillion, Nvidia has already become the world's third-most valuable company after Microsoft and Apple. So it could be tough to replicate its multibagger gains from the past several years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat's why many growth-oriented investors are already on the lookout for the \"next Nvidia.\" Could the top candidate for that title actually be its rival Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), which competes against Nvidia in the gaming and data center GPU markets?\n\nThe differences between AMD and Nvidia\n\nAMD is a much smaller company than Nvidia. It only has a market cap of $315 billion, and analysts expect it to generate less than one-quarter of Nvidia's annual revenue this fiscal year. AMD only controlled 19% of the discrete GPU market in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to JPR, while Nvidia held an 80% share. Intel held the remaining 1% share.\n\nAMD usually sells cheaper GPUs than Nvidia, but the latter has also rolled out lower-end chips in recent years to limit the former's gains in the lower-end market. Nvidia also established a strong position in the data center GPU market before AMD.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, AMD competes against Intel in x86 CPUs for PCs and servers. AMD held 35.5% of that market in the first quarter of 2024, according to PassMark Software, while Intel held a 63.4% share.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past eight years, AMD grew its share of the x86 CPU market by consistently selling cheaper, denser, and more power-efficient chips than Intel. It accomplished that by outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing as Intel struggled to upgrade its own internal foundries.\n\nAMD also sells custom APUs (which merge a GPU and CPU) for gaming consoles and notebook computers, as well as programmable chips for various markets. Nvidia sells Arm-based Tegra CPUs for set-top boxes and the Nintendo Switch and offers data center networking products through its Mellanox subsidiary.\n\nSimply put, AMD is a more broadly diversified chipmaker that generated 29% of its revenue from the data center market, 27% from the gaming market, 23% from embedded chips (including its programmable chips), and the remaining 21% from client computing chips (PC CPUs and GPUs) in 2023. In its comparable fiscal 2024, Nvidia generated a whopping 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs and the remaining 22% from other types of chips.\n\nAMD is growing more slowly than Nvidia\n\nAMD's heavy exposure to the PC market, which suffered a major slowdown after the pandemic passed, throttled its growth over the past year. In 2023, its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) fell 4% and 24%, respectively. By comparison, Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively, in fiscal 2024. That growth was entirely driven by its brisk sales of data center GPUs, which offset the slower growth of its PC-oriented chips.\n\nAMD has been expanding into the data center market with its own AI-oriented Instinct GPUs, and CEO Lisa Su recently said those deployments were \"accelerating\" and on track to become the \"fastest revenue ramp of any product\" in its entire history.\n\nAMD plans to carve out its own niche in the data center market with those cheaper GPUs and can bundle them with its Epyc data center CPUs and programmable chips. It probably won't overtake Nvidia in the AI race, but many major companies -- including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise -- have already been installing AMD's chips as a cost-efficient alternative to Nvidia's chips.\n\nAnalysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 14% and 37%, respectively, in 2024 as the PC market stabilizes and its data center business expands. In 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 26% and 51%, respectively.\n\nIt could still have a bright future\n\nAMD seems a bit pricier than Nvidia at 58x forward earnings, and its near-term growth will rely more on the PC market than the data center market. It will also remain an underdog in the GPU and CPU markets -- instead of leading those two markets like Nvidia and Intel. AMD is still a promising semiconductor play, but its broader diversification, slower growth rates, and lower market share should prevent it from becoming the \"next Nvidia\" over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq hit a new record high recently, and the good times may be far from over. History shows us that over the past 10 periods of annual market declines -- dating back to the early 1970s -- the index always has climbed for at least two consecutive years afterward. And on all but one occasion, the index posted a double-digit increase during its second year of gains. If this trend continues, the Nasdaq, heading for a 7.4% increase so far, is set to climb higher in 2024.\n\nAnd the stocks that have led the gains and could continue leading the movement are artificial intelligence (AI) players. Investors are excited about this high-growth, high-potential technology. AI may make game-changing moves -- like bringing lifesaving drugs to patients more quickly -- and could save companies and individuals money and time as it completes tasks and solves problems.\n\nThat's why right now is the perfect time to get in on potential AI powerhouses. Let's check out two AI stocks to buy hand over fist before the Nasdaq soars higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is benefiting from AI in two ways. The company uses AI across its e-commerce business to streamline operations and improve the customer experience. And Amazon sells AI solutions to customers through Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon's AI will help you choose a product based on your buying history, and AI is helping the company choose the best delivery routes for packages. These and other AI efforts should keep customers coming back and boost Amazon's profitability.\n\nAs for AWS, the service offers everything from chips for customers to train their own AI models to a fully managed service that allows customers to customize the most popular large language models (LLMs) to suit their needs. AWS customers can access the company's own lower-cost chips, as well as the fastest, highest-performing chips and services from AI chip market leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this could make Amazon one of the winners of a potential AI revolution. And Amazon already has a solid earnings track record -- so the company has the resources to invest in this hot area and continue to grow. In the most recent quarter, Amazon's net sales rose in the double digits, and operating income more than quadrupled to surpass $13 billion.\n\nToday, the stock trades for 42x times forward earnings estimates, a fair price for an already solid business with top AI prospects.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia holds 80% of the AI chip market, and though it faces competitors in the space, it's unlikely to lose its lead any time soon for two reasons. First, the company's first-to-market advantage and brand strength should keep at least some customers loyal. Second, Nvidia is pouring investment into research and development to stay ahead.\n\nInvestors expect the launch of Nvidia's H200 chip in the second quarter and then potentially the launch of the Blackwell architecture along with the B100 chip later in the year. These newer products are improvements on the company's already fastest-on-the-market chip.\n\nBut Nvidia doesn't only design chips. The company also offers a full portfolio of products and services for the AI client, including a software platform that serves as an \"operating system\" for AI. Nvidia products are offered on AWS, as mentioned, but also through all other major cloud providers. So it's easy for customers to access Nvidia's offerings directly through their cloud service.\n\nNvidia's earnings have soared, but growth may be far from over considering the company's market leadership -- and likelihood of remaining on top. Today, Nvidia trades for 35x times forward earnings estimates, which seems reasonable for such a solid growth stock. That's why Nvidia makes a no-brainer addition to any AI portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Things About SoundHound AI the Smartest Investors Know",
        "content": "The past several years have been a roller coaster ride for SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) investors. The stock debuted to much fanfare via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in early 2022, soaring more than 100% in the first week after going public. The other shoe soon dropped, however, as the stock lost more than three-quarters of its value in the following months.\n\nHowever, the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential for SoundHound to revolutionize voice AI services have sent the stock surging, gaining 286% so far this year (as of this writing).\n\nThere's more to this company than meets the eye, and there's a lot going on behind the scenes. Let's dig in to discover three things about SoundHound AI that the smartest investors know. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Nvidia investment isn't what it seems\n\nSoundHound AI has been on fire since mid-February. The spark that ignited this blaze was a regulatory filing by Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) that revealed a stake in SoundHound. Investors took that as the Nvidia seal of approval, and shares of the stock soared as much as 80% in a single day.\n\nWhile that might seem like a big deal, the devil is in the details. Nvidia's stake of 1.73 million shares represented less than 1% of SoundHound's total count of about 247 million shares -- so it isn't even a sizable investment. Furthermore, a little digging reveals that Nvidia invested in SoundHound in 2017 when it was still a start-up, so in all likelihood, none of that investment was recent.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The fact that Nvidia invested in SoundHound definitely represents a vote of confidence, but it certainly was not worth the stock doubling over the past month.\n\nAttracting some big-name customers\n\nSoundHound AI's voice recognition software is currently focused on the restaurant and automotive industries, and the company has had some big wins of late.\n\nLate last year, SoundHound inked a deal with fast food chain White Castle to create voice-enabled, drive-thru menu boards that allow customers to place orders without interacting with staff. The result was orders that were processed in under 60 seconds, on average, with a 90% order completion rate -- exceeding previous staff-based benchmarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company debuted similar technology in collaboration with Jersey Mike's Subs, offering customers phone-based ordering for pickup. The initial test involves 50 stores but could eventually expand to Jersey Mike's more than 3,000 locations.\n\nJust last month, SoundHound AI announced that after a successful pilot, its generative AI-powered assistant, Iris, would be integrated across the full line of Stellantis vehicles across Europe, available in 13 languages in 18 countries. The system allows car occupants to make a call, plan a trip, open the sunroof, or check on sports scores, among other voice-activated tasks.\n\nThese customer wins could lead to adoption by other big-name restaurants and carmakers. But time will tell.\n\nLarge and growing backlog\n\nThese big contract wins were evident in SoundHound's fourth-quarter results. Revenue of $17.1 million surged 80% year over year, while its loss per share of $0.07 was cut in half. Most telling was the company's backlog, which nearly doubled to $661 million. Since this is a forward-looking metric, it suggests that SoundHound is piling up a \"sound\" future.\n\nManagement expects SoundHound's growth to continue. In 2024, the company is guiding for revenue of $70 million at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 53%. SoundHound expects 2025 revenue of $100 million or growth of 43% while achieving positive adjusted EBITDA.\n\nIs SoundHound AI stock a buy now?\n\nBased on recent developments, SoundHound AI certainly has plenty of things going for it. That said, investors should still approach the stock with caution, particularly given its gains of more than 300% over the past year (as of this writing). As a result, the stock is currently selling for 25 times next year's sales, a frothy valuation for a company that has yet to generate a profit.\n\nThat's not to say that investors should avoid SoundHound AI completely. Rather, the stock is risky, and any position should represent a small part of a diverse portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Technology Stocks to Take You From Next to Nothing to $500,000 and Beyond",
        "content": "Finding quality stocks to buy isn't too terribly tough for most investors. Finding stocks that could turn practically nothing into half a million bucks within one lifetime, however, does have its challenges.\n\nPotential candidates are likely to be found within the tech sector, since technology is ultimately at the heart of most major sociocultural advancements. But these companies must also be able to adapt products and services that are perpetually in demand. This criterion narrows the list of possibilities quite a bit.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three technology stocks that -- given enough time -- have a great shot at turning next to nothing into $500,000, if not more.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nYou most likely know Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) as a maker of computer graphics tech. Its stand-alone GPUs (graphics processing units) are a favorite among video gaming enthusiasts, although the company also offers display solutions for PCs without graphics cards.\n\nComputer displays aren't its biggest business anymore, however -- not even close. Last year, data center processing solutions accounted for over three-fourths of the company's revenue. By and large, these data centers are using Nvidia's hardware in artificial intelligence applications. As it turns out, the same computer architecture that makes for high-performance graphics cards is also perfectly suited to handle the heavy-duty data loads inherent in AI! That's why Nvidia has been making purpose-built artificial intelligence hardware for a while now. And that's why Nvidia is believed to now control the vast majority of the AI hardware market.\n\nProblem? Investors keeping close tabs on Nvidia probably already know that. With its market cap of well over $2 trillion, this company is now a regular contender for the honor of being the world's biggest. This sheer size, however, also seemingly limits its potential upside. How big can a corporation realistically get?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe thing is, there is no actual limit to Nvidia's potential size. Those are purely mental constructs. That's particularly true in light of the fact that the world's still only scratched the surface of its use of AI. An outlook from Precedence Research suggests the worldwide AI market is set to grow an average of 19% per year through 2032, while Mordor Intelligence says the AI computing hardware market alone will likely grow at an annualized pace of 26% through 2029. Both predictions of course bode well for Nvidia.\n\n2. The Trade Desk\n\nThe Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is anything but a household name. But there's a good chance you or someone in your household is regularly impacted by its service.\n\nIn simplest terms, The Trade Desk helps companies advertise more effectively, particularly as it pertains to digital advertising. From ad-supported streaming to billboards to conventional web ads, The Trade Desk is a one-stop shop for getting your message in front of consumers. Just as important, the company helps advertisers better target specific audiences and monitor the success of ad campaigns. It even integrates its platform with other, comparable advertising-support and data-monitoring services.\n\nIt's not exactly a brand new idea. Companies have sought to fine-tune their advertising for decades now. It didn't take long for advertisers to do the same shortly after the internet itself was identified as a viable advertising medium.\n\nThe Trade Desk arguably does it better than most, if not all, competitors in this space. Quadrant Knowledge Solutions identified The Trade Desk as 2023's top advertising technology provider, putting it ahead of competitors like Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and Adobe. IT research and consultancy Gartner also regularly ranks The Trade Desk as a leader within the ad-tech space, again placing it on par with Adobe, Google, and Amazon.\n\nThis powerful platform is the chief reason the company's revenue is expected to climb nearly 23% this year and almost another 20% next year. Earnings are growing even more, from last year's $1.26 per share to an expected $1.47 this year to a projected $1.76 per share next year.\n\nThis might help seal the deal: The Trade Desk is doing well, but the stock remains well below analysts' estimates of its worth. Most analysts rate shares as a strong buy at this time, with its consensus price target of $97.85 being more than 20% above the stock's present price.\n\n3. IonQ\n\nLast but not least, add IonQ(NYSE: IONQ) to your list of unstoppable technology stocks that could take you from zero to half a million dollars in a relatively modest amount of time.\n\nMost investors have likely heard the term \"quantum computing.\" But most investors would also be pretty hard-pressed to name a single publicly traded company working on this revolutionary computing technology. IonQ is one of the few. Using ionized ytterbium atoms as the basis for its computing platforms, the company can offer computational solutions that couldn't even be conceived with the use of more conventional, silicon-based hardware. For perspective, quantum computes are on the order of 100 million times faster than the type of computers you may use at home or at work.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily make them better for all purposes. Quantum computers aren't practical for most ordinary uses like browsing the internet or playing a video game, for instance. They're only well suited for handling complex calculations like those needed to be done by AI or drug development platforms. They may also be able to handle jobs like financial modeling or cybersecurity, which aren't necessarily data-intensive but are still complicated, multifaceted tasks.\n\nInvestors must understand that these solutions are no longer merely theoretical, or even in a beta-testing stage. They're real. IonQ's quantum computers are now commercialized. The company booked $22 million worth of revenue last year, and it is expected to report $39 million this year en route to nearly $81 million worth of sales in 2025.\n\nThe company's not yet profitable, for the record, and probably won't be in the foreseeable future. That's a risk to consider simply because unprofitable companies often make for volatile, unpredictable stocks.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean IonQ shares won't perform well in the future, particularly as more investors start seeing the company's opportunity in the quantum computing space.

        "content": "Many investors are interested in the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks for good reasons other than outstanding returns over the last year. This elite group of tech companies has strong brands and a growing customer base, and they are very profitable businesses -- everything an investor looks for in a solid investment.\n\nOver the last year, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has returned 51%, beating the Nasdaq Composite's 32% and the S&P 500's 23% return. There's some debate about how long this group will continue to outperform in the near term. On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, most of these stocks trade at big premiums to the average stock in the major indexes.\n\nThe most expensive of the seven is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which currently has a trailing P/E of 77. Despite its high valuation, the company's superior growth and future opportunity could justify more new highs for years to come. Here's why the stock remains a core holding in my portfolio.\n\nNvidia's growth runway\n\nNvidia is benefiting as data centers switch from central processing units (CPUs) to the far more powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Historically, data centers spent about $250 billion per year on infrastructure, but this amount has increased for the first time in many years, which could be just the beginning of a major spending boom.\n\nThe market for Nvidia's products is proving to be much bigger than originally thought a few years ago. Revenue surged 265% year over year to $22 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, significantly outpacing the growth for the other Magnificent Seven companies. META Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nNvidia is just scratching the surface of this opportunity. Company executives have talked about $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure that is starting to adopt accelerated computing, which is the use of multiple GPUs running together to handle large data workloads.\n\nHowever, the opportunity could be much bigger. AI is allowing companies to use data in ways that was not possible before, as Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress discussed at the recent Morgan Stanley technology conference.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is why there are new types of data centers emerging called GPU-specialized cloud service providers. It's one reason Nvidia executives believe the actual data center infrastructure market could be worth closer to $2 trillion.\n\nWhy buy the stock?\n\nAI is completely turning traditional computing on its head, which is reflected in the accelerating demand for Nvidia's H100 GPU. It's almost become a bragging right for companies to talk about how many H100s they have purchased. Magnificent Seven member Meta Platforms has said it plans to have 350,000 H100s up and running by the end of the year.\n\nDemand is already outstripping supply for Nvidia's H200 GPU, which is on track to start shipping in the fiscal second quarter. Company guidance calls for revenue to be up 234% year over year in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nOver the long term, analysts expect Nvidia to grow earnings at 35% per year, which is also higher than the other Magnificent Seven. META EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nNvidia's leading share in the GPU market should translate to more growth as data centers continue to upgrade components for AI. As this opportunity unfolds, this GPU stock offers long-term upside that could outperform the other Magnificent Seven over the next decade. Relative to expected earnings this year, Nvidia isn't all that expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37.\n\nNvidia has been the king of GPUs for many years, so it's basically got the right product at the right time to benefit from the AI boom. But what ultimately seals the deal for me is how much cash the business is producing.\n\nIts trailing free cash flow totaled $27 billion, up 10-fold over the last five years. This gives the company tremendous resources to stay ahead in GPU innovation and generate shareholder returns for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Today’s article takes us beyond basketball to introduce three stocks to buy in March. Forget buzzer-beaters and brackets, this March Madness is all about empowering your portfolio with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe global AI market is poised for significant growth, driven by its expanding applications across various industries. Forecasts indicate a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3%, reaching a market size of nearly $2 trillion by 2030. Now, savvy investors are looking for slam-dunk stocks that capitalize on this explosive growth.\n\nBut here’s the secret: You don’t need to chase the usual AI giants. Today, we’ll unveil three underappreciated names quietly benefiting from the proliferation of AI in their specific niches. These three stocks to buy offer the potential for robust returns as AI reshapes the world around us.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelestica (CLS) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong our first stocks to buy is Celestica (NASDAQ:CLS), a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company that builds custom hardware for clients across industries. Celestica released solid fourth-quarter and full-year financial results in late January. Revenue increased 5% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 36% to 76 cents. That positive performance was driven by the Connectivity & Cloud Solutions segment, with significant demand for bespoke hardware solutions from hyperscaler clients.\n\nCelestica’s strategic investments in AI, machine learning and cloud solutions have positioned it as a leader in the EMS space. In fact, management forecasts continued momentum in 2024. Robust revenue growth and improved product mix are expected to be the main drivers of future growth.\n\nAs a result, CLS stock has gained more than 55% year-to-date (YTD), on top of a 150% increase in 2023. Despite this impressive run, shares are trading below sector median multiples at 15.2 times adjusted forward earnings and 0.7 times trailing sales. Long-term investors may regard a potential decline in the CLS stock price as an opportunity to invest in the booming AI hardware market.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIT heavyweight Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is a top contender in our March slam dunk stocks to buy list. Its focus on AI and on-premise deployments positions it well within the rapidly growing AI server market, projected to balloon to $150 billion by 2027.\n\nDell recently released robust earnings, with EPS exceeding analyst expectations by a robust 22% YOY, despite a slight dip in overall revenue. Yet, the deferred revenue reached $30.3 billion, reflecting strong customer commitments. The metrics announced highlight the strength of their AI strategy. Currently, Dell offers a comprehensive AI server portfolio for the demanding workloads of advanced AI applications like machine learning and natural language processing. Management also recognizes the growing importance of multi-cloud and edge-computing\n\nHere’s the kicker: despite a 40% YTD surge, DELL stock still trades at a favorable valuation — 14.4 times forward earnings and 1.0 times trailing sales. Plus, Dell’s board just increased the dividend by 20% and committed to 10% annual hikes through 2028, making it a solid income earner. Analysts project a price target of $125, suggesting a 17% upside potential.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nDon’t want to pick individual AI winners? No problem! Rounding out our March “stocks to buy” list is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) offers a one-stop shop for exposure to the booming AI chip market.\n\nSMH started trading on Dec 20, 2011, and currently has 26 holdings. The top 10 stocks comprise close to 74% of its $19.15 billion net assets, making it a concentrated fund. The leading 5 names in the fund include semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), followed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Netherlands-based ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), all crucial for developing the next generation of AI technology.\n\nWith AI rapidly transforming industries, the demand for powerful AI chips is expected to skyrocket. VanEck recognizes this potential, highlighting strong growth indicators for the sector in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSMH boasts a solid track record, having returned 30% YTD and 81% over the past year. Plus, it offers a .48% dividend yield. Keep in mind the expense ratio is 0.35%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil ​h​olds both long and short positions in ​N​VDA stock.

Retail sales rose 0.6% in February after falling a revised 1.1% in January, hurt partly by inclement weather, according to the Commerce Department’s report on Thursday.\n\nBelow we highlight a few areas and the related ETFs & stocks that may benefit handsomely from the retail sales.\n\nWinning Areas\n\nFood and Drink Places\n\nSales at restaurants and bars increased 6.3% year over year and 0.4% sequentially.\n\nAdvisorShares Restaurant ETF (EATZ) – The AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets in securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their net revenue from the restaurant business.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 79.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -3.5%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.1%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 16.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia GTC 2024: What to expect from the AI giant’s big conference",
        "content": "To say Nvidia (NVDA) is on a hot streak is an understatement. Shares of the AI darling are up a staggering 267% over the last 12 months and 79% year to date. Tech companies across the world covet its graphics cards like rare jewels, and CEO Jensen Huang is as in demand as some heads of state.\n\nAnd on Monday, March 18, he’ll kick off Nvidia’s annual GTC conference with a two-hour keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., outlining what’s ahead for the company in the year ahead. In prior years, Nvidia has used the show to debut some of its biggest products.\n\nIn 2022, it announced its Hopper graphics architecture and H100 graphics processing unit, which is now the go-to card for companies training and deploying AI models. This year, Nvidia is widely expected to debut Hopper and the H100’s successors, kicking off what could be a new rush on the company’s products.\n\nThe new architecture, codenamed Blackwell, and GPU, dubbed the B100, are anticipated to offer far better performance when it comes to running models like OpenAI’s GPT-3. Nvidia isn’t exactly hiding its plans for the B100. During the Supercomputer 2023 conference, the company showed off a slide outlining the GPU’s potential capabilities compared to the H100 and H200 cards.\n\nIn addition to the Blackwell architecture and B100 card, Nvidia will also likely give attendees and viewers a look at the latest advancements to its CUDA software. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will take the stage at GTC 2024 on March 18 in San Jose.(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe platform, which lets programmers take advantage of a GPU’s processing capabilities for AI and other applications, is an essential part of Nvidia’s overall enterprise strategy and helps lock in developers who build on Nvidia’s software, virtually ensuring they’ll stick with Nvidia’s products in the future.\n\nNvidia could also announce that it will begin producing its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market. The chip, according to Reuters, is meant to serve as an alternative to Nvidia’s more powerful H100 and H200 chips. The US prohibits Nvidia from selling those chips to Chinese customers for fear that the Chinese military and government will use them to develop advanced AI applications to rival the US's.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose are the big stories we’ll be watching from GTC, but we’ll also likely get plenty of other announcements and debuts from both Nvidia and its partners.\n\nSome 300 exhibitors are set to take part in the conference, and speakers ranging from OpenAI’s COO Brad Lightcap and Meta’s vice president of AI research Joelle Pineau to Microsoft’s vice president of generative AI Sébastien Bubeck set to make appearances at the show.\n\nYahoo Finance will be on the ground bringing you all of the biggest news from the conference and chatting with some of Nvidia’s top executives.

        "content": "Jabil Inc. JBL reported mixed second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same.

        "title": "Forget Magnificent Seven: Jim Cramer Likes These ‘Super 7’ European Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at some European stocks liked by Jim Cramer. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Likes These Super 3 European Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in one of his latest programs on CNBC that the US stock market isn’t the only one with the “breadth” problem, referring to the phenomenon where most of the stock market gains last year came from a handful of mega-cap tech stocks or Magnificent Seven stocks which include companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). Cramer said that the concentration of stock market gains is much higher in the European stock market. Cramer shared some data to back this point which was published by Citi’s equity research team led by Dr. Beata Manthey. He said that in January and February this year, just five stocks in Europe accounted for about 45% of the total gains of MSCI Europe Index.\n\nJim Cramer Shares a New \"Shopping List\" of Stocks for 2024\n\nJim Cramer said that analysts at Citi recently ran a screen for mega-cap European stocks with characteristics similar to Magnificent Seven stocks in the US: high earnings growth, solid margins and strong economic moat. Cramer said Citi analysts believe these stocks have lower valuations when compared to their US counterparts and have more room to run in the future. As you will see later in this article, Cramer also believes several of these seven stocks in Europe have a lot of growth potential.\n\nJim Cramer said that Citi’s Super Seven list “makes for a great list of companies.”\n\nHowever, Jim Cramer did emphasize that he cannot recommend investors to start piling into these stocks immediately since most of them are trading at their all-time highs. Cramer said that it would make him look a “little crazy” to recommend stocks that already had a “huge run.” But Jim Cramer urged his viewers to see these companies as a “shopping list” of high quality stocks that “could be very attractive” on pullback.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Likes These Super 7 European Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent program on CNBC in which he walked his viewers through Citi's Dr. Beata Manthey's Super Seven European stocks and shared his bullish thoughts on these companies. Cramer thinks these stocks should be bought on a pullback.\n\n7. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO)\n\nJim Cramer recently quoted Citi and said the “leader” of the Super Seven group of stocks is Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). Cramer said it’s “obvious” that the pharmaceutical company is the leader of the group. Cramer said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) was the company which originally came up with GLP-1 drugs for diabetes. He said Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is “years ahead” of his American favorite weight loss stock Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer said that recently it was revealed that the GLP-1 pill Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is developing could be much more effective than the one being developed by Eli Lilly. Jim Cramer also highlighted the FDA’s recent approval for Novo Nordisk's (NYSE:NVO) drug for heart disease. Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) said the FDA approved its weight-loss drug Wegovy for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight or obese people with established cardiovascular disease.\n\nCramer said that it “can’t go wrong with either of these stocks” as he believes more Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has more room for growth.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“As we discussed in last quarter’s commentary, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is a newer addition to the strategy. Over the fourth quarter, we continued to build the position to an average weight. As a reminder, Novo Nordisk is a global pharmaceutical company based in Denmark and has long been the leader in developing insulin for diabetes patients. In recent years, the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs has been shown not only to help diabetics control blood sugar levels but also to have significant efficacy in weight loss. Obesity has become a global epidemic, creating materially negative knock-on effects for humans that range from an increase in cardiovascular events and, thus, higher mortality to a lower general quality of life. We believe that, over time, payors will recognize the value of these obesity treatments to both patients and the overall healthcare system.”\n\n6. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the European stocks in the Super Seven group recommended by Citi and liked by Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer said ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) is operating in the semiconductor equipment sector where there’s limited competition and ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) remains “unrivaled.” Cramer said that ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) has a “monopoly” in making equipment that is required to make advanced semiconductor chips.\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) excellent stock performance, since the stock is up 58% over the past one year and 33% in 2024 through March 14. ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) stock has been roaring after ASML Holding N.V (NASDAQ:ASML) posted a blockbuster quarterly report in January. Cramer seemed especially excited about ASML Holding N.V's (NASDAQ:ASML) net bookings which came in at a whopping  €9.2 billion, compared to the Street’s estimate of just €3.57 billion.\n\nIn addition to ASML, Jim Cramer likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nPolen International Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netherlands-based ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan-based Lasertec play dominant roles within different segments of the global semiconductor industry. In both cases, shares rallied significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023, prompting our positions to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio. We believe both companies will see demand for their products as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and soon high-numerical aperture lithography must be utilized to manufacture the world’s smallest chips. However, in our estimation, 2024 could deliver a year of less exciting growth for the semiconductor industry, which prompted us to trim these positions back.”\n\n5. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY)\n\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is another important member of the Super Seven group of European stocks. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is very “exciting” for “a lot of people out there.” Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. Cramer named some of the top brands of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) which include Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Givenchy, Dior, Fendi, among many others.\n\nJim Cramer said that one of the strengths of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) is its target market — the rich. Cramer said LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) posted a “blowout” quarter in January and the stock has been a “phenomenal” performer. He believes LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (NYSE:LVMUY) stock can “keep winning” but recommended investors to wait for a pullback to buy it.\n\nHere is what  Distillate Capital has to say about LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE:LVMUY) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“After rebalancing, Distillate’s International FSV strategy offers a higher free cash flow yield both to market cap and enterprise value, and has substantially more stable fundamentals and less leverage than the index. The largest new position is LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (NYSE:LVMUY), where estimated free cash ϲows are up year-to-date while the stock is down.”\n\n4. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNext on the list of the Super Seven group of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about is SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), the Germany-based software company. Cramer said SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) “took its time” to adjust to the “new world” of Cloud computing but eventually caught up and now it’s making “big money” off of artificial intelligence. Jim Cramer praised the stock’s run over the past several months (it’s up about 64% over the past one year) and said it’s “probably not done.” Cramer also said that he “should have caught it” but he was focusing more on ServiceNow. Cramer is also bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP).

Importantly, SAP’s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both robust cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive.\n\nWe also view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of its customers’ day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back.”\n\nTo see rest of the stocks in this list click Jim Cramer Likes These ‘Super 3’ European Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best March Dividend Stocks To Buy Centi-Billionaire Bill Gates' Top 15 Dividend Stocks 15 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia (NVDA) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.4% over the past month to $23.22.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and Insiders Love These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and Insiders Love These 5 Stocks.\n\nIn an interview given to the Palm Beach Civic Association in January 2024, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones said that whatever happens in the US stock market in the next 12 to 24 months would largely depend on the fiscal situation and policy response of the next President of the country.  Jones, who has a net worth of over $8 billion, said the stock market is not the manifestation of the economic fundamentals. Instead, according to Jones, markets represent people’s ideas and what they make of the economic situation. Paul Tudor Jones said that there’s a chance the stock market would be “here or lower” in the next five to ten years. However, the billionaire also said it’s possible that the markets would go higher from here if the next President of the US devises a better “policy response” next year.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones Thinks AI Could Save Us From the Current \"Mess\"\n\nPaul Tudor Jones also highlighted the concentration of stock market gains problem in the US and said last year most of the stock market gains came from the Magnificent Seven group of stocks which are pulling overall market returns through the roof. He repeatedly said that AI is “hugely” important when it comes to productivity gains and GDP growth in the US. He thinks AI could be the thing that would save us from the current economic “mess.”\n\n“AI could be the knight on the horse that rides and saves us.”\n\nWhat Worries Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones About AI?\n\nBut AI-related threats worry Paul Tudor Jones. He referred to a survey where close to 3,000 AI experts were asked whether they believe AI would end humanity. According to Jones, a whopping 58% of the experts said yes. The billionaire said US policymakers will have to decide how to tackle this problem. Jones believes AI is growing at an “unbridled pace” since there’s so much money to be made in the domain but the biggest problem for policymakers would be to balance the benefits and threats of AI to make it sustainable.\n\nStory continues\n\nJones said that he’s a macro trader who doesn’t trade a lot of individual stocks and instead focuses on trading “basket” of stocks like S&P 500, in addition to indexes in Europe and Japan. Nonetheless Jones' latest portfolio shows he has big stakes in companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM). In this article we will see which stocks in his portfolio are also seeing insider buying activity. Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and Insiders Love These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first scanned Paul Tudor Jones' Q4'2023 portfolio and picked 10 of these stocks which saw heavy insider buying activity over the past 12 months. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund and insider activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Wave Life Sciences Ltd (NASDAQ:WVE)\n\nPaul Tudor Jones' Stake: $184,729\n\nRNA medicines company Wave Life Sciences Ltd. (NASDAQ:WVE) is one of the stocks in Paul Tudor Jones' portfolio that saw insider buying over the past few months. RA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P., which has a director status at the company's board, bought one million shares of the company on December 11, 2023, at $5.00 per share. Since then the stock has gained about 54%.\n\nIn its Q4 earnings call earlier this month, the company talked about future expectations and progress on its products:\n\n\"We’re advancing WAVE-006 in our ongoing RestorAATion clinical program. The program is comprised of two interconnected portions, RestorAATion-1 for healthy volunteers and RestorAATion-2 in AATD for patients who have the homozygous PiZZ mutation. In addition to generating key safety and PK data, RestorAATion-1 is designed to rapidly establish a dose level and regimen that’s expected to engage target. In the RestorAATion-2, we will be taking multiple assessments of serum M-AAT through the low, medium, and high dose cohorts, which will enable us to quickly detect the potential presence of wild-type healthy M-AAT protein in serum, representing achievement of proof of mechanism.\n\nRemember, these easy patients have never made M-AAT protein. So, the presence of any M-AAT would demonstrate that WAVE-006 is successfully editing RNA. We are progressing well in RestorAATion-1. Dose escalation is ongoing. Pharmacokinetic data is as expected, and blinded safety data has been encouraging. We’re on track to initiate the RestorAATion-2 study and deliver proof of mechanism data from RestorAATion-2 in patients with AATD this year. Turning to DMD. This week, our team attended the 2024 MDA Clinical and Scientific Conference, where we showed posters on our clinical data from Part A, including the first evidence of myogenic stem cell or satellite cell uptake. Myogenic stem cells are the progenitor cells for new myoblast, and we’re not aware of any other clinical data for exon skippers or gene therapies that have been able to demonstrate myogenic stem cell uptake.\n\nThe DMD community is excited about these data and what they may mean for their boys. Our post has also highlighted our industry-leading mean 53% exon skipping, which was driven by muscle tissue concentrations of 42 micrograms per gram or 42,000 nanograms per gram, which is thousand-fold above what other exon skipping companies have reported. These data give us confidence in achieving best-in-class dystrophin protein expression in our ongoing potentially registrational phase 2 clinical trial, FORWARD-53. FORWARD-53 is an open label trial, which is currently evaluating 10 mg per kg doses of N531 administered every other week. The trial is powered to evaluate functional endogenous dystrophin expression after 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, which will be the trial’s primary endpoint.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:IOVA)\n\nPaul Tudor Jones' Stake: $269,493\n\nTudor Investment Corporation initiated a new stake in Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:IOVA) during the fourth quarter of 2023, buying $269,344 worth of company shares during the period.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Wayne P. Rothbaum, a director at Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:IOVA) board, bought 5,000,000 shares of Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:IOVA) at $9.15 per share. The stock has gained about 22% since then.\n\nAristotle Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We sold Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) following uncertainty which arose from the company canceling out of two investor events. Iovance is in the late stages of FDA review on their lead candidate Lifileucel in advanced melanoma. These cancellations could stem from issues with site inspections which tend to take place later in the review cycle. The company has not commented on why it canceled these investor events, and we do not think this bodes well for the prospects of a straightforward approval with a clean, positive label for the company.”\n\n8. Aon PLC (NYSE:AON)\n\nPaul Tudor Jones' Stake: $38,144,573\n\nAon PLC (NYSE:AON) ranks ninth in our list of the stocks bought by Paul Tudor Jones as well as corporate insiders. Professional services and management consulting company Aon PLC (NYSE:AON) is among the top stock picks of Jones as his hedge fund had a $38.14 million stake in Aon PLC (NYSE:AON).\n\nOn February 7, 2024, Lester B Knight, a director at Aol plc, bought 50,000 shares of Aon PLC (NYSE:AON) at $301.97 per share. Since then the stock  has gained about 6%.\n\nIn addition to AON, Jones is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM).\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Aon plc (NYSE:AON) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“AON PLC’s (NYSE:AON) stock price underperformed this past quarter following the announcement of the company’s acquisition of NFP, a middle market insurance broker, for $13 billion. Though the deal complements Aon’s current business, it is expected to be dilutive to earnings in the near term, prompting a sell-off in the shares. We will continue to assess the merits of the NFP transaction, but it does not currently change our long-term view of Aon, which we view as a steady, durable, low-teens earnings compounder.”\n\n7. Scholar Rock Holding Corp (NASDAQ:SRRK)\n\nPaul Tudor Jones' Stake: $475,490\n\nMassachusetts-based biopharma company Scholar Rock Holding Corp (NASDAQ:SRRK) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks in Paul Tudor Jones’ portfolio that are also bought by corporate insiders.\n\nTudor Investment Corporation owns a $475,490 stake in Scholar Rock Holding Corp (NASDAQ:SRRK) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nOn October 16, Srinivas Akkaraju, a director at Scholar Rock Holding Corp's (NASDAQ:SRRK) board, loaded up on 2,189,781 shares of Scholar Rock Holding Corp (NASDAQ:SRRK) at $6.85 per share. Scholar Rock shares have skyrocketed by about 98% since the date of this insider buying transaction.\n\nIn addition to SRRK, hedge funds are also buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM).\n\n6. Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN)\n\nPaul Tudor Jones' Stake: $3,677,256\n\nPaul Tudor Jones, via his hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation, increased his stake in project management software company Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN) by over 200% during the fourth quarter of 2023, ending the period with a $3.7 million stake in Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 24 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN). Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN) kept seeing heavy insider buying activity throughout 2023.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "The area of artificial intelligence (AI) is hot right now, but that doesn't mean it's a short-term investment opportunity. You could score an even bigger win by choosing quality AI players and holding them for the long term as they take part in a potential AI revolution.\n\nThis technology could transform many industries. However, these changes won't happen overnight, which means AI players can benefit every step of the way.\n\nTwo companies, in particular, make great long-term AI buys because they're powering AI projects. Without these companies' products and services, many programs might not unfold as efficiently or successfully as they're unfolding today. These players provide the chips, servers, and other behind-the-scenes elements that are crucial to AI -- and their earnings have taken off in recent years.\n\nLet's take a closer look at these two AI powerhouses to buy and hold for the next decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) play an essential role in the realm of AI. They power the training and inference processes that are absolutely crucial if you want an AI model to carry out its job down the road of solving complex problems. Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, but the company isn't resting on its laurels. Instead, it's investing in research and development to remain ahead.\n\nThe efforts are working. Nvidia aims to launch its new H200 chip in the second quarter of this year and is readying a new chip architecture known as Blackwell, along with the B100 chip for launch possibly later this year. Today, Nvidia holds 80% of the AI chip market, and this dominance is likely to continue due to the company's brand strength and will to keep innovating.\n\nEven better, Nvidia doesn't only sell chips -- the company offers a broad range of AI products and services that are available through the world's biggest cloud companies like Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Nvidia has built a complete platform and expertise in AI, making it the go-to provider for companies aiming to develop projects in this market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis expertise has helped Nvidia report record earnings in recent times, with sales and net income climbing in the triple digits. And even though Nvidia shares have taken off, they still trade at only 36x times forward earnings estimates, a reasonable price considering the company's strength in this high-growth market.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is another behind-the-scenes AI superstar. The company has been around for 30 years, but only in recent times has it seen earnings and share performance take off -- thanks to its AI business. Supermicro provides servers, workstations, full rack scale solutions, and more to customers in the AI space.\n\nA few things help Supermicro stand out. The company uses a building block architecture, meaning it uses common elements across platforms so it can quickly assemble products for clients. This also allows it to incorporate the latest technology into its products. Speaking of this, Supermicro works hand in hand with the world's top chipmakers, including Nvidia, so that it knows about upcoming chip launches and can immediately make the latest innovations available in its offerings.\n\nSupermicro also offers customers a vast selection of configurations in order to tailor their orders to their needs.\n\nAll of this has helped Supermicro score a huge victory in the AI market. Just recently, the company reported its first $3 billion quarter -- that's higher than revenue for the entire year back in 2021.\n\nChief Executive Officer Charles Liang said the company's numerous customer wins now are resulting in increasing demand. Liang says he expects AI growth to continue for many quarters and possibly many years. If he's right, earnings and share-price performance may just be getting started.\n\nSupermicro trades for 54x forward earnings estimates. This may not seem cheap but it's actually a fair price for a company playing a key role in a high-growth industry. Supermicro's standout strategy could help this player continue to win over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "If You Like Nvidia for Its AI Exposure, Then You'll Love These Two Stocks",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023. So far this year, it's also the best-performing stock in the entire index. The winners keep running higher as investors gravitate toward companies that are successfully monetizing artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite the company's red-hot returns, there are reasons to believe that Nvidia could grow into its valuation over time. But some investors may want to look outside the tech sector for AI opportunities. That's where GE HealthCare Technologies(NASDAQ: GEHC) and Deere(NYSE: DE) come into play. Here's why Nvidia and these two underrated AI plays could be worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with following the AI leader\n\nScott Levine (Nvidia): Over the past year, several stocks have emerged as compelling routes to gaining AI exposure. But sometimes it's OK to go with the obvious choice. For investors bullish on the prospects of AI -- and it's hard not to be -- Nvidia is still a great option. Sure, the stock has skyrocketed more than 290% since this time last year, but shares can continue flying higher.\n\nConsider, for example, the valuation of Nvidia's shares. Currently, the stock is trading at 36 times forward earnings. This may seem like a frothy valuation, but it's common for stocks with high expectations surrounding them to trade at such valuations. It may seem counterintuitive to characterize a stock with a market capitalization in excess of $2.3 trillion as a growth stock, but the AI market is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of more than 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to research firm Grand View Research.\n\nWhile Nvidia generates revenue from the gaming and automotive industries, it's the company's data center business that's the cash cow, representing 78% of revenue in fiscal 2024. Because large language models and generative AI programs require colossal amounts of computing power, data centers use Nvidia's chips -- such as its Hopper Tensor Core GPU (graphic processing units) -- to help handle the considerable computing demands placed on them.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia foresees a ripe growth opportunity related to its AI offerings in the form of \"AI factories.\" According to management, these are innovative data centers specifically built for AI purposes such as \"processing, refining, and transforming vast amounts of data into valuable AI models and tokens.\" Nvidia estimates that leading companies will have their own AI factories to support their operations.\n\nDespite the rapid rise in its price, Nvidia's stock doesn't seem to be unattractively valued. The company generates massive amounts of cash -- $26.9 billion in fiscal 2024 -- so its stock is still a great way to quench investors' thirst for AI exposure.\n\nAI is integral to the growth plans at GE Healthcare\n\nLee Samaha(GE HealthCare): Investment in AI continues to be explosive, and the immediate beneficiaries are companies like Nvidia that create the architecture around it. That said, there's a reason why AI investment is exploding, and it comes down to the productivity improvements it generates. That's why the next wave of beneficiaries will be companies that use AI to add value to their solutions for customers.\n\nProductivity improvements are never more important than in the healthcare industry, where huge volumes of important data and information are created that aren't yet being analyzed to the best of their ability. That's where GE Healthcare, a leading provider of imaging, ultrasound, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and patient care equipment, comes in.\n\nThe company has 58 AI-enabled device authorizations, more than any other medical technology company. Its imaging equipment can be embedded with AI to produce more intelligent systems that quickly and accurately diagnose and predict outcomes. This is a significant plus in a critical-care environment such as intensive care units, emergency departments, or neonatal intensive-care units.\n\nDeveloping and releasing new AI-enabled products is a vital part of GE Healthcare's revenue and margin expansion plans. Indeed, management wasted no time in investing in AI after it was spun off from General Electric in early 2023 with an agreement to acquire Caption Health, a leader in AI applications in ultrasound scans, which was announced in February 2023. Moreover, management recently announced a deal to buy MIM Software, an AI solution provider of analysis for imaging and radiotherapy.\n\nInvestors can expect GE Healthcare to continue adding and developing complementary AI solutions and adding value in the process. That's great news for healthcare providers, patients, and investors.\n\nDeere is playing the long game with AI\n\nDaniel Foelber (Deere): Deere is a good example of a technologically-forward company that often gets overlooked as a top AI player. But investors should be skeptical when it comes to massive industrial companies posing as tech companies.\n\nNot to pick on Honeywell International too much, but it has been touting monetization of the industrial internet of things and automation for several years now, yet its growth has slowed to a sluggish pace.\n\nInvesting in innovation doesn't always translate to a material impact on the bottom line. But Deere is showing that its Smart Industrial strategy, which was introduced in 2022, is helping drive its performance. To quote Deere CEO John May from the Q1 fiscal 2024 earnings call:\n\nAs I think about 2024, it's helpful to consider the smart industrial journey that we've been on, which has been grounded in unlocking incremental value for our customers through technology and enabling Deere to deliver structurally higher financial performance. I'm extremely pleased with how we've executed our production systems approach, centralized and advanced our tech stack and focused on delivering value across the entire life cycle of our solutions, all while allocating capital in a more efficient and strategic manner. Deere's last few years of financial performance are evidence of the structural improvement that comes with executing our strategy, all while delivering better outcomes for our customers.\n\nThis expansion cycle has been particularly sizable for Deere. When plotting a cyclical company's earnings, investors want to see a squiggle line that slopes up and to the right, accounting for downturns and expansions, with each expansion including new highs. Deere's recent expansion was abnormal. Here you can see the company's last 20 years of annual earnings. DE Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nThere are a few downturns, followed by expansion periods and then boom -- the recent cycle from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 showcased explosive growth. Deere attributes a lot of that growth to its combination of software and hardware that's driving efficiency for its customers.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC last December, Deere's Chief Technology Officer famously said that Deere is preparing for a fully autonomous farm by 2030. The company has already leveraged AI through computer vision and machine learning to help farmers lower material costs and boost crop yield by maximizing production per acre. More sophisticated machines also help boost the need for Deere services, which it can provide through its dealership network.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, Deere's research and development expense reached $2.2 billion -- the first time it has ever surpassed $2 billion in a single fiscal year.\n\nThe company's capital priorities begin with maintaining its strong balance sheet. That's followed by investing in the business and organic growth, growing the dividend while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio based on its midcycle earnings, and buybacks.\n\nInvestors looking for an industrial company that's putting innovation first to drive long-term shareholder returns over immediate returns should consider Deere for their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Ranked From Cheapest to Most Expensive",
        "content": "For more than a year, Wall Street has been putting smiles on most investors' faces. Following bear market declines in 2022 for the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite, all three major stock indexes have powered their way to record-closing highs in 2024.\n\nAlthough there's no shortage of factors that have fed the current bull market, such as a lower inflation rate and the continued strength of the U.S. economy, much of the heavy lifting has fallen on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are some of Wall Street's most influential businesses\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most prominent businesses on the planet in terms of both aggregate sales and innovation. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from handily outperforming all three major stock indexes over long periods, the Magnificent Seven offer sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is the dominant provider of desktop operating systems (Windows) and has seen its share of global cloud infrastructure service spend jump to 25%, thanks to Azure. Apple's iPhone has accounted for around half or more of the U.S. smartphone market share since becoming 5G-capable. The company has also bought back a jaw-dropping $651 billion of its own stock in 11 years. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for a virtual monopoly (90%-plus share) of GPUs in use in high-compute data centers this year. Amazon leads in two categories. It's the far-and-away biggest player in e-commerce and held a 31% share of global cloud infrastructure service spend via Amazon Web Services (AWS), as of September 2023. Alphabet's Google is a virtual monopoly in internet search, with close to 92% of worldwide share in February. Alphabet also owns the second-most-visited social site (YouTube) and the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms is the owner of Facebook, the most visited social site in the world. Collectively, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and other apps, Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users to its social media \"real estate.\" Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs) and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nStory continues MSFT Chart\n\nWhile all seven of these components have been phenomenal long-term investments, their outlooks going forward could differ greatly -- and that all starts with their valuations.\n\nRanking the Magnificent Seven stocks from cheapest to priciest using a common valuation tool\n\nTo be upfront, analyzing the valuations of public companies can be subjective. What one investor believes is pricey, another might view as an incredible deal. Likewise, fundamental metrics are fluid and constantly changing as companies report their operating results and Wall Street analysts react to this data.\n\nNevertheless, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has stood the test of time as the most rudimentary measure of value for public companies. But since Wall Street is forward-looking, utilizing the forward P/E ratio, which takes into account consensus earnings per share (EPS) for the upcoming year, makes the most sense.\n\nBased on consensus estimates from Wall Street, as of the closing bell on March 13, here's how the Magnificent Seven ranked from cheapest to priciest using this common valuation tool:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 17.83 forward P/E ratio Meta Platforms: 21.56 Apple: 23.9 Nvidia: 30.43 Microsoft: 31.07 Amazon: 33.95 Tesla: 41.14\n\nTo offer some context, the forward P/E ratios for the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq 100 are 21.1 and 31.32, respectively.\n\nBased purely on earnings potential for the coming year, Amazon and Tesla appear relatively pricey, while Alphabet and Meta Platforms look like bargains. The latter is particularly interesting, given that Meta has more than quintupled since its 2022 bear market bottom yet remains attractively valued, based on consensus EPS estimates for the company.\n\nHowever, the forward P/E ratio doesn't provide the most complete story in terms of valuation. While it can be a helpful tool for assessing mature businesses, an even better measure of value exists for the generally faster-growing and innovation-driven Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the smartest way to rank the Magnificent Seven from cheapest to most expensive\n\nIn addition to being dominant within their respective industries, the Magnificent Seven share another trait: They tend to reinvest a sizable percentage of their operating cash flow back into their respective businesses. In other words, they're willing to forgo maximum profits in the short term to invest in higher-growth initiatives that could really fuel their growth rates years down the road.\n\nRather than relying on the forward P/E ratio, analyzing the multiple that each company trades at relative to its forward-year consensus cash flow is a considerably smarter way to value these dominant businesses.\n\nHere's how the Magnificent Seven stocks rank from cheapest to most expensive when examined relative to next year's cash flow:\n\nAlphabet (Class A shares, GOOGL): 12.53 times next year's cash consensus cash flow Amazon: 12.8 Meta Platforms: 13.19 Apple: 21.1 Microsoft: 24.15 Tesla: 27.38 Nvidia: 30.59\n\nOn one hand, Microsoft, Tesla, and especially Nvidia are making it tougher for growth seekers to find value. Tesla's operating margin is falling as it slashes prices on its production models in order to keep inventory levels under control. Meanwhile, Nvidia is set to face a laundry list of headwinds -- including AI GPU competition from many of its top customers (which are Magnificent Seven components).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Amazon is historically inexpensive, relative to its future cash flow. As AWS grows into a larger percentage of net sales, Amazon could see its cash-flow growth handily outpace its annual sales growth. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms confirms that it's still a potential bargain at just 13 times forward-year cash flow.\n\nBut the best deal within the Magnificent Seven is Alphabet, which also happens to be the cheapest constituent when using the forward P/E ratio.\n\nAlphabet's foundational operating segment continues to be Google. With a nearly 92% share of worldwide internet search, Google is the logical go-to for advertisers looking to target their message(s) to specific consumers. More often than not, this will give Google exceptionally strong ad-pricing power.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet's advertising segments benefiting from long-winded economic expansions, Google Cloud looks like a force to be reckoned with. After years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered its first operating profit in 2023.\n\nCloud service margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and enterprise cloud spending is likely in its early innings. In short, this segment may be Alphabet's prime source of cash-flow growth throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nIf you're looking for a deal among the Magnificent Seven stocks, the data suggests you can't go wrong with Alphabet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Chipmaker and AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues its unstoppable upward journey, having more than tripled in value in 2023 and up about 78% year-to-date. The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.\n\nNVDA Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings Yet Again\n\nNow the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share handily beat the analysts’ estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago.\n\nImportantly, NVDA’s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion.\n\nAs expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters.\n\nLooking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%.\n\nExuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, “We’re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing… [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term Trajectory Remains Impressive\n\nNVDA is Wall Street’s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia’s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What’s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA’s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.\n\nAccording to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone. These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.\n\nNVDA Could Likely Go for a Stock Split\n\nInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn’t inherently alter the company’s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.\n\nOther prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple’s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.\n\nFurthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.\n\nInterestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA’s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying NVDA for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.\n\nThe insatiable demand for all things AI far outpaces the available supply, underscoring the potential for accelerated computing and generative AI adoption across various industries and regions. This trend is anticipated to be a primary driver of revenue and earnings growth for NVDA in the years ahead.\n\nWith NVDA’s highly anticipated live GTC conference scheduled for March 18-21, my bullish outlook on the company remains steadfast, prompting me to purchase shares at their current levels.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Sell in March Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "If you want to know which growth stocks to sell this month, you’re in the right place. Growth stocks have had a tremendous start to 2024. Between artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, quantum computing and other cutting-edge breakthroughs, this is a promising time for the sector.\n\nEven with all these promising developments, however, that isn’t a green light for all growth stocks. In fact, much of the rally in growth stocks was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates meaningfully in 2024. Instead, the economy remains strong and inflation hasn’t declined as much as anticipated.\n\nBetween high valuations and the potential for the Fed walking back prior support to the market, the growth space could be set for a major correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, not all growth stocks are created equal. In fact, some are quite risky here following their tremendous rallies over the past year. These are seven growth stocks to sell that look especially risky for March 2024 and beyond.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Crowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the epitome of a good company selling at a ridiculous price. While Crowdstrike has a promising business with favorable growth prospects, the market has gotten far too optimistic, setting up inevitable disappointment later this year.\n\nMany software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies traded up to incredibly high price-to-sales ratios in 2021 and then saw their share prices collapse in 2022 as financial gravity kicked in. You might think that investors would learn their lesson from the collapse of these formerly high-flying software firms.\n\nAnd yet, Crowdstrike has recovered all of its 2022 losses. In fact, with a more than 150% rally over the past 12 months, CRWD stock has now reached new all-time highs. This time around, traders are pointing to potential AI benefits in the cybersecurity space. That could well be the case, but it will be a competitive race to deploy AI in cybersecurity and it’s far from assured that Crowdstrike will be the ultimate winner.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut with CRWD stock at more than 80 times forward earnings and at nearly 20 times forward revenues, Crowdstrike is priced for perfection. Any slowdown in revenues or disappointment on the AI front could lead the share price to crash.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn paper, it seems like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) should be a tremendous business. The company is a classic marketplace with tremendous network effects, and it gets to grab a piece of millions of transactions across mobility, food delivery, and other such services.\n\nIn addition, Uber has had a massive opportunity to build brand awareness and loyalty in recent years. The pandemic caused a huge disruption to shopping and dining out, giving Uber the chance to impress customers with efficient food and grocery delivery.\n\nAnd while Uber has grown its business and seen revenues surge, it has still struggled to convert that into consistent profitability. UBER stock is going for a lofty 65 times forward earnings right now.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Uber will be able to push profitability that much farther from here, either. The company is increasingly facing regulatory pushback as consumers and restaurant owners complain about high fees and drivers claim that they are underpaid. All this suggests that Uber will struggle to raise its margins from here which in turn would imply that shares are dramatically overvalued.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Dell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors probably remember Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) as a company that makes personal computers. And Dell still has a large consumer electronics business to be certain.\n\nHowever, it merged with EMC in 2016, and in doing so, it became a leader in storage, information security, and consulting functions as well. DELL stock has hummed along, largely under the radar, for many years due to its largely unglamorous collection of business operations.\n\nThat has changed recently, however, with DELL stock rising an incredible 199% over the past 12 months.\n\nIn particular, DELL stock has soared more than 35% over the past month. This came following an earnings report where Dell highlighted rapid growth in its AI server sales. Despite this, however, Dell’s overall revenues actually declined 11% year-over-year for the quarter.\n\nAt this price, investors are pricing in way too much optimism based on Dell’s AI functions, even as the overall business is not showing much favorable momentum. Morningstar’s William Kerwin agrees; he believes DELL shares are worth just $55 each, implying that the stock has more than 50% downside from here once the AI server hype fades.\n\nSoundhound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Dell, I believe Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) has rallied more due to general enthusiasm around artificial intelligence than any specific strengths at this particular company.\n\nSoundhound AI is a small unprofitable firm that aims to develop and commercialize voice, sound, and natural language artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nSOUN stock quadrupled in February. This came due to news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) had taken a position in Soundhound AI. Sounds great, right? However, Nvidia invests in a variety of smaller companies, and these bets can be quite small. Reportedly, Nvidia invested a modest $3.7 million in SOUN stock, which is better than nothing but not necessarily a massive vote of confidence either.\n\nSOUN stock has cooled off a bit recently following a disappointing earnings report. While revenues grew sharply, the company reported a wider-than-expected operating loss and hasn’t even reached breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis yet. Shares seem wildly overvalued at their current $1.8 billion market capitalization given that analysts foresee just $70 million in revenues for 2024.\n\nGrowth Stocks to Sell: Celsius Holdings (CELH) A view of several cans of Celsius (CELH) energy drinks, on display at a local grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock.com\n\nEnergy drink marker Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has given its investors a jolt. CELH stock is up 200% over the past year, and a stunning 7,000% over the past five years.\n\nNeedless to say, early investors in Celsius have enjoyed blockbuster returns. But at some point, the risk/reward ratio turns against shareholders. We are at that point today following Celsius stock’s 56% year-to-date rally.\n\nIncredibly, Celsius has posted these incredible gains even as the company’s latest quarterly report saw its earnings per share fall short of expectations. Yes, revenues are still soaring, but the firm appears to be giving up ground on pricing to drive its revenue growth, leading to slipping profit margins.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Celsius had a tremendous run when it was a small company. But it is now a more mature business with fewer growth opportunities that faces robust competition. This will make it exceedingly difficult for CELH stock to maintain its current 80 times forward P/E ratio.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company that offers treatments for a wide variety of ailments.\n\nThe firm has enjoyed incredible performance over the past year thanks to its GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro, which have become blockbuster products for helping with weight loss and diabetes management.\n\nThese drugs are helping lots of people, and the company’s sales are likely to continue to grow in the coming years. However, the valuation has seemingly gotten way out of hand, with LLY stock up more than 125% over the past year. Eli Lilly now has a market capitalization of almost $700 billion and sells for a stunning 60 times forward earnings.\n\nAnalysts project that Lilly will bring in about $41 billion in annual revenues this year, and topline growth is around 20%. That’s a lot of money, but it’s not nearly enough to support a $700 billion market cap given the short patent lives of pharmaceutical drugs before they give way to generic competition.\n\nEli Lilly is enjoying a windfall right now, but the party is going to end a lot sooner than LLY stockholders realize.\n\nCava (CAVA) Horizontal, medium closeup of \"CAVA\" outdoor free standing brand and logo signage on a bright sunny day against a clear blue sky.\n\nSource: Bruce VanLoon / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava (NYSE:CAVA) is a fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain. The company completed its IPO in 2023 and the stock has now doubled since last fall.\n\nIt’s hard to see why there is so much enthusiasm, though. The bull case is that Cava can be the Chipotle of Greek food. In a vacuum, that may sound like an enticing pitch. But many fast casual chains have tried to become the Chipotle of some specific cuisine and the vast majority invariably fizzle out.\n\nThe fast casual dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. This adds up to a scary outlook for CAVA stock given that it is trading at a jaw-dropping 200 times forward earnings and 10 times revenues today. Those sorts of multiples are hard for restaurants to maintain even if their business execution is perfect.\n\nMy guess is that Cava will be more like the next Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK). Shake Shack, you may recall, went public back in 2015 and became a momentum stock for a time with traders bidding it up fourfold following the IPO.\n\nSince then, SHAK shares have underperformed despite a dramatic amount of growth in its underlying business. Given Cava’s similarly sky-high multiples, it will take many years for the company’s growth to catch up with today’s stock price, if it ever does at all.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s annual artificial intelligence conference is just days away and expectations are high for the semiconductor maker to deliver news that will sustain the blistering rally in its stock.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Says Ukraine Deal Requires Security Pledges for Russia US House Passes Bill That Would Force TikTok Sale or Ban It Ukraine Hits Third Russian Refinery in Escalating Drone Strikes Ex-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary Physical Intelligence Is Building a Brain for Robots\n\n“Nvidia GTC,” the company’s graphics processing unit technology event, has quickly become a global AI conference for developers. It runs from March 18-21 in San Jose, California, with Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang due to speak on the opening day. His comments may help Nvidia stock end a bout of volatility and resume its surge of more than 80% this year.\n\n“It’s a huge catalyst because they’ll probably give more information, not only on industry penetration,” said Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co. He compared the gathering to Apple Inc.’s yearly product launch.\n\nHuang typically kicks off the event with an introduction of new products and an outline of his latest vision for where technology is headed. He’ll be under pressure to show off innovations that can replicate the wild success of the H100 chips for data centers and cement Nvidia’s leading position in this lucrative market.\n\nThis year’s appearance carries more weight after Nvidia’s 2024 gains alone added $1 trillion in market value for the company, catapulting it into a position as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index. It’s been a bumpy ride for investors since the March 7 record close: on Tuesday, the shares snapped the worst two-day drop in five months, only to slide again on Wednesday.\n\nSome of that volatility is likely due to traders positioning ahead of next week’s event. Options data show that investors are paying an increasing premium for calls to profit from a rise in prices as the meeting approaches, especially for short-term contracts.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It’s kind of like the Apple product introductions — everybody tries to get in front of it,” said Mortonson. “The million-dollar question is if you get selling on the news after Jensen’s keynote presentation.”\n\nThe event is so important to the shares that Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya have dubbed it the “AI Woodstock.” They have raised their Nvidia price target to $1,100 from $925 ahead of the conference.\n\nEven after almost quadrupling in the past 12 months, Nvidia’s valuation suggests that there’s still room for further gains, according to BofA. The stock now trades at a lower multiple than when ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, Arya wrote.\n\nAnd Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia heading into the event. The company has 60 buy ratings, seven holds and zero sells among analysts tracked by Bloomberg.\n\n“I feel very comfortable and confident where the level of demand is and upside to pretty much every estimate I’ve seen out there, probably including our own for the next 12 to 18 months,” TD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay said in an interview. He has an outperform rating and $900 price target on Nvidia.\n\nWhile expectations are positive leading into the San Jose event, analysts and investors alike are aware that Nvidia stock is trading near technically overbought levels that could spark another pullback. Because of its size — it rocketed into the ranks of the three largest S&P 500 stocks this year — sharp moves in any direction could swing the entire market.\n\nNvidia “is a name that’s being held to very high expectations and so they have the pressure to continue to perform,” said Chris Carey, a portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Council. “If they don’t, it’s going to be a surprise in the short term, and then an opportunity as well.”\n\nMixed in with concerns that hype around Nvidia’s leadership in AI is baked into the stock, there’s also the possibility for more positive momentum, depending on what comes out of an event that has historically given shares a boost.\n\n“There’s so much speculation and so much over-exuberance on this name that it doesn’t really trade on valuation anymore,” said Mortonson. “It’s believe in the dream, so to speak, and the dream is happening.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nHon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported its second straight quarter of strong profit growth after lucrative AI hardware sales helped offset weakness in iPhone and electronics demand. ByteDance Ltd.’s human resources chief has taken the helm of the company’s sharply reduced gaming division and will refocus the business on more personal content, avoiding a head-on clash with Tencent Holdings Ltd. SoftBank Group Corp. is exploring a potential investment in Mistral AI, the French company emerging as Europe’s hottest artificial intelligence startup, people with knowledge of the matter said. Reddit Inc. is telling potential investors in its initial public offering that it expects revenue in 2024 to grow by more than 20% versus the previous year, according to a person familiar with the situation. The fate of an app used by 170 million Americans is now in the hands of 100 senators.

        "content": "If the market’s dramatic shifts this year have left you feeling dizzy, you’re not alone – but blue-chip stocks might be the anchor you need to regain stability. Amidst the current rally (bubble?), we’ve seen stocks rise, plummet, and rise again, pushing investors toward small-caps, tech, and growth stocks. But, while profitable thus far, that might be the wrong move, while blue-chip represents foundational stability sorely lacking within many portfolios.\n\nThe economic landscape remains uncertain, far from a clear path to recovery as inflation remains frustratingly above the Fed’s 2% target. Just one adverse event could send speculative stocks tumbling once more. With this in mind, look to these seven blue-chip stocks for stability, value, and decent diversification to protect yourself against the worst of the fallout if (or when) the proverbial shoe drops.\n\nU-Haul (UHAL) a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nU-Haul (NYSE:UHAL) dominates the DIY moving and truck rental market, far outpacing competitors like Penske Truck Leasing and Budget Rental with its expansive network of 23,000 locations and a fleet of 200,000 rental trucks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut the company often flies under investors’ radar, even those looking for blue-chip stock opportunities. As noted by Barron’s Andrew Bary, “There is virtually no Wall Street coverage of U-Haul. It is run like a private company by the Shoen family, which owns about half the company.”\n\nUHAL is currently valued at an attractive 16x earnings and 1.8x book value. Should the anticipated interest rate adjustments materialize with the Federal Reserve reducing its target rate, we’re likely to see significant activity in the residential housing sector. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.\n\nThis uptick in housing movement directly benefits U-Haul, as more individuals opt for the cost-effective DIY moving approach. Recent statistics show that only 22% of movers hire a company for their moving needs, while 37.5% choose to rent a truck and move themselves. With household budgets remaining constrained, a decrease in interest rates and an increase in residential relocations are expected to further bolster the preference for DIY moving, underscoring U-Haul’s strategic advantage in the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is mounting an epic comeback, surging more than 200% following its 2022 slump, reasserting its position as a blue-chip stock. At that time, intense competition and faltering subscription growth dimmed its allure among investors, casting doubt on its status as a former FAANG heavyweight. But this narrative is swiftly shifting as Netflix reclaims its blue-chip media stock spot, underscored by its impressive fourth-quarter earnings report in January.\n\nIn a challenging year for consumer cyclicals, marked by tightened household budgets in 2023, Netflix demonstrated its unique position within our media consumption ecosystem. The company reported a 12% increase in overall revenue for the year, while its operating margins rose to 21% from 18%. Furthermore, Netflix welcomed over 13 million new subscribers in the final quarter alone, highlighting the platform’s enduring appeal.\n\nNetflix’s strategy to enforce stricter password-sharing policies has evidently paid off, contrary to fears of alienating users who previously accessed the service through borrowed credentials. Instead, these individuals appear to have transitioned into paying subscribers. Should this pattern persist, Co-CEO Greg Peters’ assertion that curbing password sharing will “support increased conversion of our addressable market in many years to come” could very well materialize, signaling a bright future for Netflix in the competitive streaming landscape.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) Healthcare business graph data and growth, Medical examination and doctor analyzing medical report network connection on tablet screen. VANI stock\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a unique choice among blue-chip stocks, perfectly bridging the gap between “hard tech,” robotics, and global healthcare. A member of both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is lauded as one of the most stable and omnipresent manufacturers of high-end, niche medical hardware. Unlike its competitors, who typically focus on traditional medical hardware like MRI machines and the like, Intuitive Surgical infuses the surgical space with robotics and automation, adopting an innovative, high-growth approach.\n\nAs post-pandemic challenges within the healthcare sector ease, Intuitive Surgical is pushing forward with its international expansion efforts. The most recent quarterly update highlighted a significant 21% year-over-year growth in global procedures using Intuitive Surgical’s flagship robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, alongside a 14% increase in new da Vinci installations. Supporting its status as a blue-chip MedTech stock, Intuitive Surgical also announced a 17% increase in sales and a substantial rise in net income to $606 million, up from $325 million. All in all, it’s one of those blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nWatch ISRG stock closely this year as the company anticipates launching its next-generation da Vinci platform shortly. CEO Gary Guthart has teased that this upcoming model will feature “10,000 times the processing power” of existing units, enhancing data collection, sensing capabilities, and overall digital and analytical performance. This marks a significant leap forward in robotic surgery technology and big opportunities for blue-chip MedTech enthusiasts.\n\nSteel Dynamics (STLD) A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWarren Buffett might consider commodity-based companies too risky to be blue-chip stock contenders, but Steel Dynamics’ (NASDAQ:STLD) unique position at an intersection of old-school manufacturing and next-gen sustainability makes it an exception.\n\nSteel Dynamics, recognized as America’s third-largest steel producer, stands out not only for its scale but also for its commitment to sustainable manufacturing. The company’s strong focus on metals recycling enhances its profitability by keeping high-quality metals cycling throughout global value chains, aligning with broader green goals. Offering a compelling 8.14% total yield, STLD attracts value-oriented investors with its appealing valuation. Moreover, the company has a track record of regularly increasing its dividend, with a recent 8% hike to $0.46 per share, marking a consistent rise for five consecutive years and maintaining a 100% quarterly payment rate throughout this period, underscoring its commitment to delivering shareholder value.\n\nIn 2023, Steel Dynamics celebrated its second-highest revenue year, with sales reaching $18.8 billion and net income standing at a solid $2.5 billion. Notably, the company demonstrated its dedication to its shareholders by repurchasing 8% of its outstanding shares over the year, a significant investment despite the higher debt costs and the expensive nature of steel production and operations. It’s surely one of those blue-chip stocks to consider for conservative investors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI tend to avoid most international stocks when looking at top blue-chip stocks (for a range of reasons not worth exploring here), but I make a definite exception for Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) in light of its current position and long-term potential.\n\nWhile not as beloved as some top blue-chip tech stocks like, arguably, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), TSMC is well-loved by industry insiders and analysts for its chip manufacturing innovation. The company is integral to the functionality of innumerable modern electronic devices and maintains its position as a leading supplier to the US, despite efforts to bolster American semiconductor production.\n\nTSMC benefits from sovereign investment, such as Japan’s allocation of a portion of its $10 billion aid package to the company, part of a broader initiative to foster regional semiconductor development. The company’s financial health is robust, affirming its blue-chip stock status, characterized by minimal debt and an impressive 40% net margin. TSMC’s fiscal discipline has ensured its stability amidst the fluctuations other stocks face throughout emerging markets, underscoring its potential for extraordinary growth and long-term opportunity.\n\nNews Corp (NWSA) a smartphone lies on a table as cartoon representations of social media, email and text notifications float overhead. social media stocks. media stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNews Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) seemingly stands out from our other blue-chip stocks because its industry – legacy media – doesn’t exactly scream “long-term value.” Historically, News Corp relied heavily on newspapers, books, and cable television. But, as American media consumption shifts towards next-generation formats, NWSA stands out for its successful pivot toward those emergent trends.\n\nThe push for NWSA’s evolution partly comes from Starboard Value, an activist investor firm that recently acquired a significant stake in the company. Following the investment, NWSA’s quarterly revenue jumped 3% year-over-year, alongside a 94% net income boost. CEO Robert Thomson credits these financial improvements to the company’s strategic move towards digital and subscription revenues, moving away from the unpredictability of advertising revenues.\n\nThis approach mirrors the strategy of many software-based blue-chip stocks, which prioritize recurring revenue streams over sporadic, larger payments. For example, NWSA is allocating effort toward digital subscription acquisition instead of high-budget advertising accounts, similar to how Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offers Photoshop subscriptions for a monthly fee rather than a hefty one-time purchase.\n\nThis strategic shift is proving fruitful as NWSA also zeroes in on niche markets, notably its Dow Jones segment and digital real estate services, showcasing strong performance. While NWSA currently de-emphasizes dividends to streamline its operations for the digital age, it still maintains a modest 1.55% total yield, balancing operational adjustments with shareholder returns.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaper. Blue-Chip Stocks at Low\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThough travel stocks tend to be cyclical and, at times, volatile, there’s no doubting Marriott International’s (NASDAQ:MAR) blue-chip stock status. The stock had a remarkable reversal post-pandemic, but the momentum is only starting to accelerate when you look at the bigger picture.\n\nThe hotel giant commands a significant lead globally, holding 17.77% of the international hotel sector, with its closest competitor, MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), trailing at 12.11%.\n\nMarriott is now targeting an up-and-coming customer base to diversify revenue away from pure vacationers and business travel by adapting offerings to appeal to remote and hybrid workers who desire both adventure and the comfort and amenities essential to digital nomads. Marriott is broadening its Courtyard brand to cater to this demographic, including new locations such as Bali and resort destinations, while enhancing existing properties with amenities like adding a lazy river to a Courtyard property in Tennessee.\n\nLooking ahead, Marriott is poised for substantial growth as it continues to extend its global presence and capitalizes on the full return of post-pandemic travel. For value investors, Marriott is a hot stock with a 6.33% total yield, affirming the blue-chip stock’s commitment to growth while ensuring shareholder value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most undervalued dow stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our introduction to Dow stocks and our coverage of some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe close of February has seen some of the strongest fireworks on the stock market despite the fact that only two months have passed since we entered 2024. Whether it's rapid and sometimes volatile share price moves, such as the ones experienced by Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), surprise dividends like the one announced by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), a fundamental shift in valuation best shown by the consistent triple digit profit growth experienced by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), or illustrious indexes such as the S&P 500 setting new records, the year has been filled with news and records.\n\nAnother change that took place in February was a reworking of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The Dow is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world, and its constitution is supposed to illustrate key pillars of the American economy to enable investors to take stock of a broad set of equities and find a suitable medium of trying to track the economy on the stock market. In February, the Dow and the Dow Transportation Index rethought its retail and transportation components, with the inclusion of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the Dow index and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in the latter at the expense of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU), respectively.  reflecting the dominance of technology in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, after the latest changes, out of the 30 stocks that are part of the Dow 30, eight can be described as pure play technology companies such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). If we loosen our definition to also count payments providers like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then more than a third of Dow stocks will belong to the technology industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese stocks are called blue chip stocks, with the moniker being representative of high value poker chips. Continuing with our list of examples of major stock market events in February, one of these, i.e. a surprise dividend, also came from a Dow stock. This dividend paying blue chip stock is the customer relationship management products and software provider Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce's earnings report for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 saw the firm beat analysts' adjusted earnings per share estimates of $2.27 by posting $2.29 in the metric during its latest quarter.\n\nHowever, while the earnings report also accompanied a revenue beat, the guidance for the current quarter ended up slightly missing estimates. During Q1 2024, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expects to rake in revenue ranging between $9.12 billion and $9.17 billion. Analysts on the flip side had an average estimate of $9.16 billion, and the revenue guidance for the full year also fell short.\n\nThis wasn't a surprise though. As part of its latest earnings release and report, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) announced that it will pay a 40 cent dividend, and at the firm's earnings conference call, CFO Amy Weaver shared:\n\nSince the inception of our repurchase program, we have now returned $11.7 billion to shareholders with an average purchase price of $182 per share. And I'm incredibly excited to announce our first ever dividend. We are enhancing our capital return strategy reflective of the confidence we have in the future of our business and our ability to drive long term cash flow. Our Board has approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend starting at $0.40, more details of this dividend are available in our press release. Additionally, the Board has approved a $10 billion increase to our share repurchase plan, bringing the total authorization to $30 billion. Based on our progress to date, the remaining balance in the program is approximately $18 billion.\n\nWith these details in mind, we decided to see which Dow stocks are finding favor among analysts. A handful of notable picks are UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). 13 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued Dow stocks according to analysts, we ranked all components of the Dow 30 stock index by the average share price percentage upside.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best semiconductor ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the semiconductor industry, head over to 5 Best Semiconductor ETFs.\n\nIn 2023, the semiconductor industry faced numerous challenges, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and decreased demand in PC and mobile device markets, leading to an 8.2% global revenue decline compared to the previous year. However, despite some persistent challenges, the industry's overall outlook for 2024 is positive, with expectations of double-digit revenue growth. KPMG'sannual survey gathered insights from 172 semiconductor executives globally. Despite the revenue contraction in 2023, 83% of respondents anticipate increased revenue growth for their companies in 2024. Additionally, 85% believe the industry as a whole will experience growth, a significant increase from the previous year's survey.\n\nSeveral positive factors are expected to drive growth in 2024, including trends in generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), cloud computing, increased semiconductor usage in automobiles, and expanding aerospace and defense budgets, which could mitigate broader economic and geopolitical risks. While 30% of semiconductor leaders perceive an excess of inventory, up from 24% last year, 19% anticipate increasing demand due to AI and emerging technologies, double the 2023 figure. Overall, 2024 is viewed as the start of another cyclical upswing for the semiconductor industry.\n\nAlso Read: ETFs in an Emerging Market: 10 Best ETFs To Buy\n\nDeloittereported that the semiconductor industry in 2023 faced its seventh downturn since 1990. However, projections for 2024 suggest a recovery, with global sales forecasted to reach $588 billion, marking a 13% improvement over 2023 and a 2.5% increase from the record revenues of $574 billion in 2022. The memory chip market played a significant role in the industry's performance last year, experiencing a sharp decline of around 31%, or approximately $40 billion. However, it is expected to rebound in 2024, approaching 2022 levels. Excluding memory, the rest of the industry saw a more moderate decline of about 3% in 2023. In terms of end markets, both PC and smartphone sales are projected to grow by 4% in 2024, following declines of 14% and 3.5%, respectively, in 2023. The recovery of these key markets is crucial for the semiconductor industry, as communication and computer chip sales, including data center chips, accounted for 56% of total semiconductor sales in 2022. However, inventory levels remained high at over $60 billion in fall 2023, posing a challenge for sales in the first half of 2024 as efforts to reduce inventory continue. Additionally, fab utilization, which reached levels around the mid-90% range during the recent shortage, is expected to decline below 70% in Q4 2023. Higher utilization rates are necessary for industry profitability, suggesting a prolonged recovery period may be required.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee also: 11 Best Vanguard ETFs For 2024\n\nHeading into 2024, the semiconductor industry is poised for a notable recovery following the challenges of Q3 2023.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n8.

Lam’s products tend to focus on etch and deposition process steps and its tools are critical in the production of NAND and DRAM memory chips as well as logic devices. While the share of overall WFE spending looks relatively fragmented across the top four to five players in the industry, each of these leading companies tends to have significant share within smaller slices of the industry, creating a stable and favorable industry structure, with share shifts tending to only happen at times of technology transition in the broader industry. We purchased shares of Lam in the quarter as we believe we are at one of those key transition points in the industry that will disproportionately benefit Lam, with a move to gate-all-around transistors in logic creating an increasing need for complex deposition and etch process stops and the emergence of high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging requiring increasingly complex high-aspect-ratio (i.e., very deep) etches, where Lam has virtually 100% market share. We also believe the market is underestimating the pent-up earnings power in the company as NAND WFE spending recovers in the coming years from one of its worst down cycles ever in 2023.”\n\n7.

        "title": "Nvidia offers developers a peek at new AI chip next week",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - How long can Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang, wear the crown as the tech world's dominant supplier of artificial-intelligence chips?\n\nWhether it is months, years or decades, the question will be key when Huang - who co-founded Nvidia in 1993 and has been CEO ever since - sets foot on the stage of a Silicon Valley hockey arena on Monday to unveil new flagship products.\n\nThe occasion is the company's annual developer conference, the first to be held in person since the pandemic. Nvidia expects 16,000 people to attend its GTC event live, roughly double the number who went to the 2019 show in person.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNvidia's market capitalization topped $2 trillion in late February, and it is now a \"mere\" $400 billion away from eclipsing Apple as Wall Street's second-most valuable company, behind stock market leader Microsoft.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's revenue to soar 81% this year to $110 billion as companies snap up its top-of-the-line chips by the tens of thousands to power chatbots, image generators and other AI systems.\n\nThat is double the sales that analysts expect from Intel, the chipmaker that dominated the personal computer boom. The question for Nvidia is whether it can parlay its recent, massive lead in AI computing into long-term dominance of a new era of computing.\n\nAt the center of that effort will be Nvidia's next generation of high-end AI processor, which analysts expect to be called the B100. The chip will sit at the center of the AI systems that Nvidia sells and will likely start shipping later this year.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's current AI chips has outstripped supply, with software developers waiting months for a chance to use AI-optimized computers at cloud providers.\n\nNvidia is unlikely to give specific pricing, but the B100 is likely to cost more than its predecessor, which sells for upwards of $20,000.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 83% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. Even after that meteoric rally, Nvidia is trading at 34 times its expected earnings, cheap compared with its PE of 58 a year ago, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat decline in Nvidia's PE valuation is the result of analysts massively increasing their estimates of the chipmaker's future earnings, and if those forecasts turn out to be too optimistic, Nvidia's stock risks plummeting back to earth.\n\nThe shares dipped 1.1% to close at $908.88 on Wednesday.\n\n\"The biggest concern is the numbers have just gotten so big, so quickly, you just worry they can't last,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said of Nvidia's recent financial performance. \"The more new products they've got coming out at higher performance and higher prices, the more runway they have.\"\n\nNvidia will also likely introduce a raft of updates to its software known as CUDA, which provides tools for developers to run their AI programs on its chips, helping keep developers tied to Nvidia's chips. CUDA makes it harder to switch to components sold by rivals like Advanced Mirco Devices and in-house chips offered by Microsoft and Alphabet's Google.\n\nNvidia last year started offering its chips and software as a cloud service to developers, and analysts are monitoring how the company expands that effort.\n\n\"The services side is really a software play,\" said Ryan Shrout of chip analysis firm Shrout Research. He said analysts will closely observe whether cloud and software providers are \"possibly getting nervous about Nvidia playing in their playground.\"\n\nCHINA BUSINESS\n\nAnother critical question is whether Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia will establish a definitive technology advantage over Chinese rivals. Washington has cut off China's access to Nvidia's most advanced chips, and China has responded with chips from Huawei Technologies Co that rival the performance of Nvidia's A100 chip released in 2020.\n\nNo Chinese company has yet claimed to match Nvidia's current flagship H100 chip released in 2022, and China-watchers expect the forthcoming B100 to leave China further behind.\n\n\"When the government developed these controls, they knew very well that companies like Nvidia would be on an almost annual basis making improvements in their silicon, their software coding and their application stack,\" said Jimmy Goodrich, an expert on China and semiconductors. \"Over time, that gap will just become exponentially larger.\"\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max A.

Indeed, some analysts see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Docebo(NASDAQ: DCBO) as better AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nHere are the median 12-month price targets for each company and the implied upside or downside compared to the current share price:\n\nNvidia: $860.50 per share (2% downside) Microsoft: $465 per share (15% upside) Docebo: $65 per share (25% upside)\n\nThese price targets do not mean Nvidia is a poor investment. Those numbers are simply educated guesses about what could happen in the next year. Even if Nvidia underperforms during that period, the stock could still outperform over the next five years.\n\nHowever, investors should not fixate on a single AI stock. The most prudent strategy is to spread money across a group of AI stocks. With that in mind, Microsoft and Docebo warrant further consideration.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has two major growth engines in enterprise software and cloud computing, and the company controls a large chunk of both markets. Specifically, Microsoft accounts for about 16% of software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue, twice as much as its closest competitor, due to strength in office productivity (Microsoft 365) and enterprise resource planning (Dynamics 365) software.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft Azure accounts for roughly 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue, which puts it seven points behind market leader Amazon Web Services, but 13 points ahead of Alphabet's Google Cloud. That success is a product of expertise in hybrid computing solutions, developer capabilities, and artificial intelligence (AI) services.\n\nMicrosoft reported better-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31). Revenue increased 18% year over year to $62 billion on strong momentum in cloud computing and modest growth in enterprise software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income soared 26% year over year to $2.93 per diluted share due to disciplined expense management.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is leaning into generative AI across its software and cloud businesses. The company launched a natural language assistant for Microsoft 365 that can draft text in Word and create content in PowerPoint. It also launched a generative AI assistant for Dynamics 365 that can automate sales, customer service, and finance workflows.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft has formed an exclusive partnership with OpenAI. Per that agreement, Azure is the exclusive cloud provider to OpenAI, meaning its infrastructure powers applications like ChatGPT. Additionally, Azure customers can integrate their own data into large language models like GPT-4 to build custom generative AI applications. JPMorgan analysts have said, \"Microsoft's investment into OpenAI, which started years ago, could potentially prove to be some of the best money ever spent.\"\n\nGoing forward, the SaaS and cloud computing markets are forecast to expand at 14% annually through 2030. That gives Microsoft a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade, especially if its AI ambitions bear fruit. That makes its current valuation of 13.3 times sales seem tolerable, despite being a material premium to the three-year average of 11.5 times sales.\n\nInvestors should consider buying a small position today, with the understanding that Microsoft is already a $3 trillion company, so other AI stocks likely offer more upside in the long run.\n\n2. Docebo\n\nDocebo sells learning management software. Its platform helps businesses create, curate, deliver, and measure the impact of learning material across internal audiences like employees, as well as external audiences like customers. Two applications are particularly innovative. Docebo Shape uses generative AI to turn source material like documents and presentations into training content, and Docebo Flow embeds training content into other software.\n\nProduct innovation has helped Docebo achieve a strong market presence. To quote Morgan Stanley analyst Josh Baer, \"Docebo is not only disrupting the internal learning management system (LMS) market, taking share from legacy vendors, but it is also leading the market in a greenfield external learning opportunity.\" He also sees Docebo as one of the software companies best positioned to benefit from generative AI.\n\nDocebo reported fourth-quarter financial results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Customers increased by 11% year over year, average contract value increased by 12%, and existing customers spent 4% more. In turn, revenue increased 27% year over year to $46 million, and net income soared 101% to $3.2 million. Management also said partnerships with systems integrators are helping Docebo land larger enterprise customers, including a top-five technology company and a top-four bank.\n\nGenerative AI remains a strategic priority for Docebo. The company plans to add new features to Docebo Shape this year, including a copilot that offers higher levels of automation and virtual role-play that provides real-time feedback. CEO Claudio Erba says, \"Shape will fundamentally change how training material is created and consumed.\"\n\nThe learning management systems market is forecast to grow 20% annually through 2030, but Wall Street expects Docebo to gain share. The consensus estimate calls for 25% annual sales growth over the next five years, which makes the current valuation of 9.8 sales look reasonable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this stock today.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "The Scariest Nvidia Statistic That Virtually No One Is Talking About",
        "content": "For the past three decades, Wall Street and investors have been on a never-ending quest to locate the next big investment trend. Some of these trends have completely changed the growth trajectory of the U.S. economy, such as the advent of the internet. For the time being, no innovation is captivating the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBroadly speaking, AI involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks that would normally fall to humans. What makes AI so intriguing is machine learning, which is what allows software and systems to grow smarter over time, which can translate into higher proficiency at assigned tasks, or perhaps the learning of new tasks.\n\nThe reason AI stocks have skyrocketed is because the technology (in theory) has applications across virtually every sector and industry. It's what compelled the analysts at PwC to predict that AI will add close to $16 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNo company has directly benefited from the AI revolution more than Nvidia\n\nBut make no mistake about it: semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undeniable face of the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nOver the course of a little more than a year, Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure foundation of AI-accelerated data centers. The company's high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are staples of enterprise-operated high-compute data centers. According to lofty expectations issued last year by analysts at Citigroup, Nvidia could account for a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers in 2024.\n\nAnother factor helping Nvidia is that enterprise demand has overwhelmed the supply of its AI GPUs. The law of supply and demand in economics states that if the supply of a good is constrained and demand is high, the price of that good will increase. The simple fact that data center sales growth has increased many multiples faster than Nvidia's cost of revenue demonstrates that the company is enjoying exceptional pricing power on its top-notch GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe potential good news in the current fiscal year -- Nvidia's fiscal 2025 began on Jan. 29, 2024 -- is that GPU production should meaningfully ramp up. Leading chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is sizably increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity (CoWoS). High-bandwidth memory systems are a practical necessity for AI-accelerated data centers, and they're packaged on CoWoS. With this supply chain issue easing, Nvidia should be able to meet the demand of more enterprise customers this year.\n\nBut in spite of this seemingly perfect scenario, Wall Street's AI darling may be headed for disaster.\n\nThis is the Nvidia statistic that should have optimists doing a double-take\n\nThere is no shortage of reasons why Nvidia could struggle to sustain a market cap in excess of $2 trillion. Just this week I pointed to its historically lofty valuation relative to trailing-12-month sales, as well as the tendency of next-big-thing trends to navigate early-stage bubbles, as viable reasons to be skeptical of Nvidia's surging stock.\n\nBut arguably nothing is scarier than Nvidia's customer concentration.\n\nPrior to Nvidia reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb. 24, Bloomberg and Barclays Research revealed Nvidia's top customers as a percentage of total sales. The company's four largest customers account for 40% of total revenue and include:\n\nMicrosoft: 15% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 13% Amazon: 6.2% Alphabet: 5.8%\n\nCustomer concentration isn't, by itself, an issue. In fact, you can make a solid argument that having some of the world's most influential innovators as your top customers is an advantage for Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe problem for the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement is that its four largest customers by revenue are actively developing AI chips of their own to complement the Nvidia GPUs they've been purchasing for their high-compute data centers. It's a pretty clear indication that these four companies aim to lessen their reliance on Nvidia's GPUs in subsequent years, or would prefer to completely ditch Nvidia's infrastructure in favor of internally developed technology.\n\nThe other issue is that even if Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet continue to purchase Nvidia's GPUs, we're more than likely witnessing a peak in orders in 2024.\n\nFor example, Meta spent almost $27.3 billion on property and equipment last year. The 350,000 H100 GPUs the company is purchasing from Nvidia will come at a cost of up to $10.5 billion. That's a pretty sizable percentage of Meta's annual capital expenditures coming from a single purchase, which almost certainly isn't going to be duplicated in future years. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has noted that his company will have \"around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs\" by the end of 2024. Presumably, Meta's chief is intimating the use of Meta's in-house-developed AI chips along with Nvidia's H100 GPUs.\n\nThe point being that Nvidia's top customers are either moving away from its GPU technology, or are highly unlikely to sustain their existing order activity beyond the current year. This is a potentially scary scenario for Wall Street's hottest AI stock that's receiving very little attention.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is having a difficult 2024. Shares of the company are down some 7% year to date; iPhone sales are slowing in China, its third-largest market; and the European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, recently slapped the tech giant with a $2 billion antitrust fine, among other regulatory headwinds. Apple says it will appeal. Oh, and the Department of Justice is also reportedly preparing its own antitrust suit against the Cupertino-based company.\n\nThose headlines are bruising enough to hurt any company. But Apple isn’t just any company. It’s the second-most-valuable publicly traded firm behind rival Microsoft and it has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices around the world.\n\nAnd, according to at least two Wall Street analysts, the company has a few other tricks up its sleeve that will help buoy it in the coming months, including its potential in the generative AI space and the ability to take advantage of its massive user base to goose subscription sales.\n\nGenerative AI could be a boon\n\nWall Street is obsessed with all things generative AI. And while Nvidia and Microsoft seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the market’s love of the technology, Apple could also stand to gain a good deal from the AI explosion.\n\n“We think [Apple’s] AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nPlus, it could prompt people to buy new devices. “Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, [Apple] seems best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change,” he added. Apple's iPhone sales are stumbling in China. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple is widely expected to debut a new version of its iOS operating system during its WWDC event in June. And while the company hasn’t given any indication about what it’s cooking up, CEO Tim Cook has said that the tech giant is working on something the company is “incredibly excited about.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has been including neural engines, which help run AI applications, in the custom chips that power its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products for years. And that could give the company the upper hand when it comes to developing on-device generative AI software. On-device AI software means easier access to generative AI programs and improved security since you don’t have to share your data over the web.\n\nServices are still a winner\n\nApple’s massive installed base of 2.2 billion devices also means that it has a huge opportunity to continue growing its services business. Over the last three years, Apple’s annual services revenue, which includes things like subscriptions to Apple TV+, AppleCare, and Apple One, has increased from $68.4 billion in 2021 to $78.1 billion in 2022 and $85.2 billion in 2023. And analysts say there’s still more runway. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to Daryanani, Apple’s services growth is “underappreciated,” and he expects “growth in the low teens range for [fiscal 2024].”\n\nBofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan offers a similar assessment of Apple’s services business, saying in a research note that he expects to see a “continued increase in monetization of services [revenue] per installed base device.”\n\nApple gets people to pay more\n\nBut one of Apple’s biggest plays is its ability to get people to keep coughing up more and more for its iPhones. It’s managed to do this by rolling out its high-end Pro line of phones and outfitting them with exclusive features such as better cameras and, more recently, more powerful processors. The promise of better capabilities, in turn, gets users to take the step up to the more expensive Pro devices compared to the standard iPhones.\n\nThat, coupled with the decision to sell last year’s iPhones at reduced prices, Wamsi says, helps Apple rake in the cash even in years when iPhone sales wane. And that’s especially important at a time when Apple’s sales in China are taking a hit.\n\n“Despite slower unit sales, Apple has been able to drive the mix of units to higher value, which in our opinion will continue as a long-term trend, thereby offsetting some of the potential unit weakness in China,” he explained.\n\nAll of that is to say that while the early part of 2024 has been challenging for Apple, the company still has a lot going for it, and nine months to turn things around.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at 11 oversold NASDAQ stocks to buy right now. To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nNASDAQ Leads The Market\n\nOn March 12, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up by 1.5%, spearheaded by the technology stocks that have been leading the tech-heavy index ever higher for a long time now. While being heavily focused on the tech sector, the NASDAQ is also known for its exposure to other sectors, such as the consumer discretionary, healthcare, and financial sectors, all of which contribute to the index's success. As a result of these market leaders, the NASDAQ has steadily become an attractive marketplace for budding and seasoned investors alike.\n\nMany investors today are thinking about current market dynamics in terms of the future outlook for the upcoming months and what that may mean for investors. On March 12, Gabriela Santos, chief market strategist at JPMorgan, joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss her thoughts on the current outlook and market. Here's what she had to say:\n\n\"We do sound positive, first on the fundamentals. For the economy, we see growth normalizing this year 2%, but zero recession in our base case. We see inflation also moderating towards 2% by the end of the year, so you still have a pretty resilient nominal growth backdrop for companies, so resilient revenue growth. At the same time, it seem to us that the big takeaway from fourth-quarter earnings was a bottoming in the margin contraction from last year.\"\n\nThe highlights above show that a positive trend for stocks should continue as we move forward into 2024, which should be encouraging for investors looking to buy into the market. Considering the upside gains in the NASDAQ being seen so far, this index may be a good place to start for those looking to buy. This is especially the case considering the fact that the index compromises of some of the most influential and profitable names in the market right now, most notably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nDiversifying Outside of Tech in 2024\n\nFor investors, one thing to note at present is that big tech isn't the only area to keep an eye on when it comes to the Nasdaq Composite Index. Santos, on CNBC's \"Closing Bell,\" highlights the fact that several other names within the tech sector and outside of it are now also beginning to rake in the gains. Here's what she said:\n\n\"It's actually a healthy sign. For example, within mega-cap tech, the 'Magnificent Seven' that dominated so much of returns last year, there was dispersion within the group but they were all up. This year, you're seeing quite substantial dispersion within the group. Some are up double digits, some are performing in line with the market, and some are down double digits. That's very healthy to see, thinking of the actual companies as individuals. You're also seeing other parts of the tech sector participate, and other sectors. Things like healthcare, which we had talked a lot about last year as being one of our favorite sectors, contributing as well. So I think it's a very healthy appreciation, that it's not just AI, it's not just about the initial beneficiaries of that theme, it's also about resilient earnings.\"\n\nIn light of the above, we believe that while tech is definitely an area to keep track of this year, investors should not just put all their eggs in the tech basket. As such, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks listed on the NASDAQ to buy right now. Our list compromises both oversold stocks in the tech sector and in other sectors, such as healthcare, to give a more holistic set of options to investors looking to buy right now. You'll thus find that we have quite a few options below to choose from, ranging from cheap healthcare stocks to buy to oversold tech stocks to buy. 11 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA trader in a financial institution using fundamentals analysis to select stocks for a portfolio.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator to pick oversold stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index for our list. The RSI indicator is a momentum indicator used in the technical analysis of stocks by measuring the speed and magnitude of a security’s recent price changes to evaluate whether the price of that security is overvalued or undervalued. Stocks with RSI values of over 70 are traditionally considered overbought, while those with RSI values under 30 are oversold. We thus used a stock screener to find oversold stocks listed on the NASDAQ with RSI values under 30 and then ranked them based on this metric, from the highest to the lowest RSI value. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, using Insider Monkey’s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nOversold NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n11. Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

It has become a smaller position through price declines and sales of shares as uncertainty increased on both the potential for new initiatives as well as their timing.\n\nI often reflect on what went wrong. How did this go from a growth stock to a value stock? There have been two causes, in my opinion. The first is that their product delivering content (not apps) on phones lost T-Mobile as a customer – sometimes we are one day closer to a bad outcome: the loss of a customer. The second, and bigger issue was with their SingleTap product. SingleTap is a technology that “enables smartphone users to instantly install an app to their Android device with a single tap…bypassing the noise of the app store environment, and dramatically increasing conversions.” The higher conversion rates mean lower costs per app install or app opening…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks Looking Like Steals in Q1",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks are attracting attention this year as artificial intelligence (AI) adoption leads to a mushrooming growth in the demand for chips. The sector’s success will have significant implications on the U.S. economy due to the ubiquitous demand for microprocessors.\n\nFurthermore, the sector is anticipated to grow in 2024 as supply chain problems are resolved following a pandemic that severely hindered the production of new chips. Legislation such as the CHIPS Act will also certainly help improve research and infrastructure for the chip industry, serving as an external tailwind. Research firm Gartner expects sales to rise by 17% this year to $624 billion.\n\nThe graphics processing units (GPU) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is leading the sector in total return and grabbing most of the headlines. However, several other semiconductor stocks hold the potential to emulate Nvidia.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the market predicted to reach $1 trillion by 2030, we’ve identified three semiconductor stocks with room for growth.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nA long-term player in the chip industry, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is looking to leverage AI, particularly through cloud computing sales related to generative AI projects, to drive its results moving forward.\n\nBroadcom’s financial health is solid. The latest earnings exceeded estimates, driven by robust growth in the AI segment. The chipmaker also raised its guidance for fiscal 2024 revenue for its AI segment. AVGO now expects AI to constitute 20% of its total or 35% of its chip sales in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe firm also reported strong performance in its VMware unit, which contributed to its diversification and software offerings.\n\nIts free cash flow was up 19.3%, from $3.9 billion last year to $4.7 billion during the quarter. It is a key metric for Broadcom’s investors because its payout ratio is 46%. AVGO is on a 13-year streak of raising dividends, making it an attractive income play among semiconductor stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, AVGO stock trades at 27.7x forward price to earnings, which makes it cheaper than many semiconductor stocks. It holds a consensus strong buy rating with an average 12-month price target of $1,552, representing a roughly 20% increase from the last reported price of $1,292.\n\nCamtek (CAMT) Camtek Ltd logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh via shutterstock\n\nCamtek (NASDAQ:CAMT), known for its inspection and metrology equipment, has a solid balance sheet and financial track record. The stock is up 12% but its 12-month price target is $91, reflecting an upside of roughly 20% from the recent price of $75.\n\nIn the last quarter, Camtek unveiled earnings per share of 57 cents, 8.22% more than expected (53 cents). The Israeli company’s revenue of $88.69 million was just over the $88.02 million estimate.\n\nAnticipating a 30% surge in its first-quarter 2024 revenues, Camtek has guided revenues between $93 million and $95 million. This prediction, separate from the recent acquisition of FRT metrology, lays the groundwork for a successful year.\n\nFor $100 million in cash, Camtek took control of FRT Metrology, a leading producer of high-precision metrology solutions for the advanced packaging and silicon carbide sectors. The purchase expanded Camtek’s portfolio to include more advanced metrology solutions. FRT is forecasting to earn more than $30 million in revenue 2024 from the segment.\n\nCamtek enjoys a strong backlog with new orders for 46 systems from various tier-1 High-Bandwidth Memory manufacturers, with most deliveries planned for 2024. These systems are essential for high-performance computing in multiple fields, such as AI and data centers.\n\nThe combination of double-digit upside, backlog of orders, and solid financial performance makes it one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy right now.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) is a prominent name among semiconductor stocks due to its strong position in the computer memory market.\n\nBecause of the rise of memory-intensive applications and systems, MU’s concentration on DRAM and NAND memory products attracts attention.\n\nMicron’s growth tailwinds are reflected on the bottom line, with revenue and earnings outstripping analyst estimates in fiscal Q1’24. Additionally, at $1.40 billion as opposed to $249 million in the previous quarter, Micron’s operational cash flow was remarkably robust. MU expects sales of $5.30 billion, plus or minus $200 million, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with a gross margin of 12.0% to 13.0%.\n\nThe chipmaker expects a strong showing this year and forecasts a quick recovery in the chip market, particularly for memory and flash storage. Micron’s advancements in high-bandwidth memory chips, especially for use in Nvidia’s AI platforms, are the foundation for a strong year.\n\nMU’s upside is limited to 3%, but this is expected when dealing with semiconductor stocks riding the Nvidia wave.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not have (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "5 Mega-Cap Tech Stocks to Buy on Ongoing Wall Street Rally",
        "content": "Wall Street has had a great year so far. Stocks have rallied on renewed optimism that the economy is likely to have a softer landing after the Federal Reserve hinted at multiple rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThis saw all three major indexes hitting record highs this year. The Dow and S&P 500 hit all-time highs in early February. Nasdaq was a bit slow in catching up, but on Mar 1, the tech-heavy index hit a new high of 16,274.94 points.\n\nTech stocks particularly performed well last year after a disappointing 2022, helping the broader market, and the rally has continued into this year. The Nasdaq gained 43.4% in 2023, recording one of its best years since 2020. The index has risen 6.7% year to date and is poised to gain in the near term.\n\nThis year’s rally is being particularly fueled by the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, led by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nExperts believe AI has tremendous potential, which is yet to be witnessed by the world. NVIDIA’s stupendous success over the past year has motivated a large number of tech companies to explore the potential of AI in a bid to secure more business opportunities in the long term.\n\nAlso, the progression of various smart devices is playing a significant role in this field, as they demand computing and learning capabilities for tasks such as face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nThese operations require features such as high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions. These specific requirements are creating favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\n\nBesides, the Federal Reserve has indicated multiple rate cuts this year after ending its monetary tightening campaigns. Market participants are expecting at least five 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.\n\nLower interest rates mean lower borrowing costs, which bode well for growth stocks.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM, which have strong potential for 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 79.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 16.1% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAmazon.com  is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program, well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 40.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13% over the past 60 days. AMZN currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. MSFT dominates the PC software market, with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems. The Microsoft 365 application suite is one of the most popular productivity software globally. MSFT is also one of the prominent public cloud providers that can deliver a wide variety of infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service solutions at scale.\n\nMicrosoft has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.4% over the past 60 days. MSFT presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNetflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 41.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 6.5% over the past 60 days.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, Atmos Energy Corporation, Consolidated Water and Toll Brothers",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. CWCO and Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nFebruary Jobs Report Shows a Mid-Year Rate Cut: 5 Winners\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell always emphasized that interest rate cuts later this year will be fitting, but they are reliant on the path of the economy.\n\nTalking about the economy, the labor market continued to exhibit strength with 275,000 nonfarm jobs added in February, much higher than the forecasted 200,000, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Payrolls are, thus, almost double the number of monthly jobs needed to keep up with growth among the working-age population.\n\nHowever, it's the rise in the unemployment level and moderation in wage growth that has bolstered the expectation of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in June.\n\nThe unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 3.9% in February. It has been hovering at 3.7% in the previous three-month period. When it comes to wage growth, average hourly earnings increased 4.3% year over year, less than expectations of a 4.5% annual pace. Notably, average hourly earnings increased 4.4% year over year in January.\n\nThe Fed, meanwhile, has kept the benchmark fed funds rate steady between 5.25% and 5.5%. The central bank intends to lower the rate by the end of this year and further trim rates in 2025 as inflationary pressure has slowed down considerably amid a resilient economy (read more: 5 Top Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates in 2024).\n\nNow, with the Fed likely to remain dovish and trim interest rates this year, tech, utility and construction companies are positioned to gain the most. Tech stocks thrive in a low-interest rate environment. This is because, in the case of rising interest rates, the future cash inflows of tech companies are affected, leading to an increase in borrowing costs and lesser profit margins. Hence, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players.\n\nStory continues\n\nUtility companies, being capital-intensive, have higher levels of debt. In a low-interest rate scenario, their debt levels decrease, helping such companies pay off dues and register profits. Construction businesses also benefit from lower interest rates since the borrowing cost of projects is reduced.\n\nWe have thus highlighted five stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation, Meta Platforms, Inc., Atmos Energy Corporation, Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. and Toll Brothers, Inc. that are well-positioned to make the most of the Fed's aim to trim interest rates. These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 16.1% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth for the current year is 79.2% (read more: NVIDIA a Must-Buy After AI-Fueled Blowout Earnings).\n\nMeta Platforms is the world's largest social media platform. META currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 13.2% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth for the current year is 34.1%.\n\nAtmos Energy is engaged in regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. ATO currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 0.5% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth for the current year is 8%.\n\nConsolidated Water is involved in the development and operation of seawater desalination plants and water distribution systems. CWCO currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 0.6% over the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth for the current year is 225.9%.\n\nToll Brothers builds single-family detached and attached home communities. TOL currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 12.2% over the past 60 days.

        "title": "AMD Rally Looks More Fragile Than Nvidia’s as Traders Bid Up AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has kept pace with Nvidia Corp.’s furious ascent of late, but the factors underpinning its rally look less certain.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets Wrap Ex-Wall Street Banker Takes On AOC in New York Democratic Primary China Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US Wheat United Tells Boeing to Stop Making Its Long Delayed Max 10s Trump Wins Republican Nomination, Setting Up Rematch With Biden\n\nOptimism over how the chipmaker will benefit from artificial intelligence is seen as overblown, suggesting recent gains could be at risk. Not only is AMD expected to grow slower than Nvidia — whose processing chips continue to be viewed as the gold standard — but the stock is much more expensive.\n\n“It is priced for perfection in the short term, and at these multiples I’m not willing to spin the roulette wheel for what could happen over the long term,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital, citing declining free cash flow and expanding multiples. “That will always be a formula for an upset.”\n\nAt a time when investors are bidding up nearly every stock with an AI story, AMD shares have risen 116% since October 26, when the Nasdaq 100 Index bottomed. In that time Nvidia has gained 128%, while the index itself is up 29%.\n\nThe stock trades at 51 times estimated earnings, making it the third-most expensive component of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Not only is Nvidia notably cheaper, with a multiple of 37, but so is Super Micro Computer Inc., the maker of servers that has risen more than 1,200% over the past 12 months and has a multiple of 42.\n\nAnalysts have been paring back their expectations. The consensus for AMD’s net 2024 earnings has dropped 16% over the past six months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the view for revenue is down 6.2% over the same period.\n\nEstimates for Nvidia, in contrast, have been surging on the back of repeated blowout forecasts, and the company’s revenue is expected to soar 80% this fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: ‘Frenzy’ for Nvidia and Other AI Chip Stocks Has Mizuho Nervous\n\nWhile Nvidia’s past several reports confirmed the tailwind it is seeing from AI, others haven’t presented as clear a story. AMD issued a downbeat revenue forecast in January, even as it gave optimistic commentary about demand for AI chips. Last week, Broadcom Inc. reported disappointing revenue despite AI-related demand and Marvell Technology Inc. gave a weak forecast.\n\nInvestors do expect AMD to be a major player within AI over the long term, and see a huge market for AI chips. In December, the company estimated the AI chip industry could grow to more than $400 billion in the next four years, double an estimate it gave a few months prior.\n\nHowever, that path could be rocky. In another uncertainty, US officials have told AMD the AI chip it made for the Chinese market is too powerful to sell without a license.\n\nSuch unsettled fundamentals are reflected in Wall Street’s more cautious view toward the company, with the stock’s consensus rating — a proxy for its ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — lower than that for Nvidia. With AMD shares trading at roughly 3% above the average price target, it suggests analysts don’t see additional upside.\n\nIts surge reflects how excitement over Nvidia has spilled over to the rest of the sector. The Philadelphia gauge is up 20% this year, more than twice the 8.3% gain of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nJordan Klein, a tech-sector specialist at Mizuho Securities, last week compared the “frenzy” for AI chipmakers to the dot-com era. “I am starting to actually get worried,” he wrote. “Investors are either in pure chase mode, or they are behind their benchmarks and under stress.”\n\nBased on how sizable rallies are occurring without any new fundamental information, he sees market participants dumping once-popular stocks “in favor of adding more of the ‘AI and Semi Winners’ that are breaking out week by week.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nWhile tech stocks have broadly risen this year, there has been at least one notable exception to the rally: unprofitable companies. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of unprofitable tech stocks is down almost 13% this year, compared with a gain of more than 8% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. The Goldman basket is down about 70% off a pandemic-era peak hit in 2021.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok intends to exhaust all legal challenges before it considers any kind of divestiture from Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. if the latest US legislation targeting the app becomes law, according to people familiar with the matter. Nvidia shares are on track to extend gains after rallying 7.2% and adding $153 billion in market value on Tuesday. The European Union is on the verge of enacting the most comprehensive guardrails on the fast-developing world of artificial intelligence. DreamSmart Group, the smartphone maker that last year pivoted toward developing artificial intelligence for mobile devices, has selected banks to prepare for its Hong Kong initial public offering that may value it at more than 15 billion yuan ($2.1 billion). Google’s investors are entitled to be furious about the stunningly incompetent rollout of the company’s Gemini artificial-intelligence system. For everybody else, including this grateful Google user and committed technology optimist, it was a blessing.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nUiPath SentinelOne\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom Luxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls How Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is primarily concentrated in a small basket of stocks called the \"Magnificent Seven\". Indeed, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all disrupting AI in their own unique ways.\n\nBut among megacap tech companies, perhaps the most important player is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The semiconductor manufacturer is at the forefront of generative AI -- its graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center operations are playing a critical role in accelerated computing, machine learning, and more.\n\nAfter generating record revenue in 2023, Nvidia is sitting on a $26 billion cash pile. Let's see how the company is investing its profits to help position itself for long-term growth.\n\n1. Voice recognition software\n\nA couple of weeks ago, investors learned that Nvidia has a small ownership position in a company called SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), a developer of voice-recognition software. The company works with automobile manufacturers and restaurants, and its software can be integrated into smart devices.\n\nBig tech has shown a keen interest in voice-powered assistants for many years. Apple acquired both Siri and Shazam, while Microsoft acquired Nuance in 2021 for nearly $20 billion. Moreover, both Amazon and Alphabet leverage the technology for their respective lines of smart home appliances.\n\nConsidering that other major tech players have invested in technologies similar to SoundHound AI's, and the projected market size is $50 billion, it's easy to see why Nvidia is making its move now -- as use cases for AI continue to evolve. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Humanoid robotics\n\nNvidia swiftly followed the news about SoundHound AI with an investment in a start-up called Figure AI. Figure AI is developing humanoid robots, similar to Tesla's Optimus robot.\n\nAlthough humanoid robots aren't commercially applied today, many companies are investing heavily in the technology. One reason could be that the addressable market is expected to reach $38 billion over the next decade, according to research conducted by Goldman Sachs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are likely a few key reasons why Nvidia is interested in Figure AI. The combination of Nvidia's chips and its under-the-radar software business could play a unique role in developing Figure AI's robotics ambitions.\n\nMoreover, the investment by Nvidia is an important step as the company seeks to grow beyond GPUs. While I see the chip business as its bread and butter, Nvidia will have to demonstrate that it has alternative products and services that can scale as competition in the AI landscape heats up.\n\n3. Enterprise software\n\nMany investors see Nvidia as primarily a hardware business, but one of the most overlooked areas the company is exploring is enterprise software. In September, Nvidia participated in a $500 million funding round for artificial intelligence (AI) software company Databricks.\n\nFollowing the investment, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said that \"enterprise data is a gold mine for generative AI.\"\n\nDatabricks adds a new layer for Nvidia's enterprise software services business, which is already operating at an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. This is an important relationship for Nvidia to nurture as demand for AI-powered services continues to surge, and I don't think the partnership should be overlooked.\n\n4. New product innovation\n\nNvidia's A100 and H100 chips have played a major role in its growth over the last year. However, despite the popularity of these semiconductor models, the company is already designing even better technology.\n\nIt's marketing its next-generation chips under the moniker Blackwell. Of particular interest, Nvidia's H200 chips reportedly double the inferencing performance of the H100. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, management told investors that the H200 chips are already witnessing strong demand, and Nvidia is planning to launch in the second quarter.\n\nFollowing the release of the H200, Nvidia is planning to encore with its most powerful chip yet later this year.\n\n5. Supply chain\n\nThe last area that Nvidia is investing in is the supply chain. Semiconductor businesses are generally cyclical, given their exposure to broader trends in technology spending and manufacturing. Over the last few years, supply chains and logistics efforts have become strained due to a mixture of COVID-induced disruption and geopolitical tensions. Nvidia has not been immune to these challenges.\n\nIn order to keep up with surging demand, Nvidia has had to make some concessions on the cost side of the house. The company has been ratcheting up its spending in order to fulfill backlog. While this includes sourcing components for chips, it's important to note that Nvidia does not make its own chips. Instead, they outsource this part of the supply chain to Taiwan Semiconductor. Given Nvidia's heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor's fabrication facilities, it's going to very important that this relationship remains strong.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-US stocks may not be in a bubble, but a pullback could be near",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Some market participants believe the relentless U.S. stock rally is poised for a breather, even if it remains unclear whether equities are in a bubble or a strong bull run.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index is up over 25% in the last five months, a phenomenon that has occurred just 10 times since the 1930s, according to BofA Global Research. In an advance led by stunning gains in chipmaker Nvidia, the S&P has already made 16 record highs this year, the most in any first quarter since 1945, CFRA Research data showed.\n\nBullish investors argue those gains stem from solid fundamentals, rather than the type of rampant speculation that has accompanied past bubbles. Oft-cited reasons include a strong U.S. economy, expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, and excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nYet some investors believe the market's nearly uninterrupted ascent means a pullback is due. The last time the S&P 500 slid more than 5% was in October, though BofA data shows such sell-offs historically occur three times per year on average. The index is up 8.5% this year.\n\n\"A lot of good news is priced into the market,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \"From my perspective that just suggests that the risks are skewed to the downside.\"\n\nIt is not immediately clear what could cause a market sell-off. While stronger-than-expected inflation has dented expectations for how deeply the Fed will cut rates this year, many believe borrowing costs are still heading lower. Elevated consumer prices have also been seen as evidence of economic strength.\n\nInvestors have largely dismissed other concerns, from pockets of instability in U.S. regional banks to China's lackluster economy.\n\nNevertheless, some indicators are flashing a warning. The S&P 500's weekly relative strength index (RSI) - which gauges whether stocks are overbought or oversold - has climbed to just over 76, a level it has rarely topped since 2000, Miller Tabak data showed.\n\nStory continues\n\nSignificant sell-offs followed the last two times the index exceeded those levels: a 10% drop in the S&P 500 in January 2018 and a 30% plunge as COVID-19 emerged after the index topped that level in January 2020.\n\n\"None of this means we're looking at a major long-term top,\" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \"However, it does tell me that we're getting ripe for a material pullback.\"\n\nGrowing investor optimism has also raised concern. The percentage of investors expressing a bullish view about the six-month outlook for stocks rose to 51.7% in the latest weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors, only the fourth time the bullish level has topped 50% in nearly the past three years.\n\nHigh optimism is often viewed as a contrarian indicator because it means the bar for positive surprises is elevated.\n\n\"The sentiment backdrop right now ... makes the market vulnerable to a turn lower,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nHistory shows the current advance may be primed for a pause. The S&P 500 erased losses from the prior bear market when it hit a record high on Jan. 19, and has advanced about 7% since then.\n\nThat is in line with past rallies, when stocks kept climbing after breaching new highs. Those moves, however, were followed by declines of at least 5% in the 12 times such a situation occurred, said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist.\n\nBUT IS IT A BUBBLE?\n\nFor some, the market's optimism - coupled with parabolic moves in shares of Nvidia and other AI-focused companies - has evoked comparisons with past periods when asset prices soared to unsustainable heights only to come crashing down, such as the meme stock rallies of 2021 and the dot-com surge of 1999.\n\nNvidia's shares are up over 80% this year after tripling in 2023, making it the third most valuable U.S. company. Other AI-linked stocks have posted tremendous year-to-date gains, including Super Micro Computer, which has soared 300% and is set to join the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia has shown a strong relationship with S&P 500 performance, JPMorgan strategists wrote.\n\n\"We caution investors that this relationship is likely to work in reverse when the AI euphoria peaks,\" the strategists said.\n\nOthers, however, note differences with bubbles of the past.\n\nKeith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, wrote that the S&P 500 technology sector's three-year outperformance against the broader S&P 500 stands at about 30%.\n\nThat is roughly in line with the 30-year average and far from the peak of just above 250% in March 2000, Lerner said.\n\nAnd there seems to be little indication of euphoria in the new issue market, where initial public offerings have been comparatively muted.\n\nOnly 54 companies had IPOs in 2023, compared with 311 in 2021, before the S&P 500 peaked in January 2022, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\n\"Sentiment has warmed up on equities since mid-2023 ... but is nowhere near bullish levels of prior market peaks,\" wrote Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at BofA Global Research. The bank recently raised its year-end target on the S&P 500 to 5,400 from 5,100. The index closed at 5,175.27 on Tuesday.\n\n\"In our view, this bull market has legs,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)",

        "title": "Exclusive-Samsung to use chip making tech favoured by SK Hynix as AI chip race heats up, sources say",
        "content": "By Heekyong Yang\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics plans to use a chip making technology championed by rival SK Hynix, five people said, as the world's top memory chipmaker seeks to catch up in the race to produce high-end chips used to power artificial intelligence.\n\nThe demand for high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has boomed with the growing popularity of generative AI. But Samsung, unlike peers SK Hynix and Micron Technology, has been conspicuous by its absence in any dealmaking with AI chip leader Nvidia to supply latest HBM chips.\n\nOne of the reasons Samsung has fallen behind is its decision to stick with chip making technology called non-conductive film (NCF) that causes some production issues, while Hynix switched to the mass reflow molded underfill (MR-MUF) method to address NCF's weakness, according to analysts and industry watchers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSamsung, however, has recently issued purchase orders for chipmaking equipment designed to handle MUF technique, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\n\"Samsung had to do something to ramp up its HBM (production) yields ... adopting MUF technique is a little bit of swallow-your-pride type thing for Samsung, because it ended up following the technique first used by SK Hynix,\" one of the sources said.\n\nSamsung said its NCF technology is an \"optimal solution\" for HBM products and would be used in its new HBM3E chips. \"We are carrying out our HBM3E product business as planned,\" Samsung said in response to Reuters' questions on the article.\n\nAfter the article was published, Samsung issued a statement saying \"rumours that Samsung will apply MR-MUF to its HBM production are not true\".\n\nThe HBM3 and HBM3E are the newest versions of high bandwidth memory chips that are bundled with core microprocessor chips to help process vast amounts of data in generative AI.\n\nSamsung's HBM3 chip production yields stand at about 10-20%, lagging SK Hynix that has secured about 60-70% yield rates for its HBM3 production, according to several analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to one of the sources, Samsung is already in talks with material manufacturers, including Japan's Nagase, to source MUF materials. But mass production of the high-end chips using MUF is unlikely to be ready until next year at the earliest, as Samsung needs to run more tests, the person added.\n\nThe three sources, mentioned above, also said Samsung plans to use both NCF and MUF techniques for its latest HBM chip.\n\nAll sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.\n\nNvidia and Nagase declined to comment.\n\nAny move by Samsung to use MUF would underscore the growing pressure it faces in the AI chip race, with the HBM chip market, according to research firm TrendForce, expected to more than double this year to nearly $9 billion amid AI-related demand.\n\nNCF VERSUS MUF\n\nThe non-conductive film chip manufacturing technology has been widely used by chipmakers to stack multiple layers of chips in a compact high bandwidth memory chipset, as using thermally compressed thin film helps minimise space between stacked chips.\n\nBut there are often problems linked to adhesive materials as manufacturing gets complicated as more layers are added. Samsung says its latest HBM3E chip has 12 chip layers. Chipmakers have been looking for alternatives to address such weaknesses.\n\nSK Hynix successfully switched to the mass reflow molded underfill technique ahead of others, becoming the first vendor to supply HBM3 chips to Nvidia.\n\nSK Hynix's market share in HBM3 and more advanced HBM products for Nvidia is estimated at above 80% this year, according to Jeff Kim, an analyst at KB Securities.\n\nMicron joined the high bandwidth memory chip race last month, announcing that its latest HBM3E chip will be adopted by Nvidia to power the latter's H200 Tensor chips which will begin shipping in the second quarter.\n\nSamsung's HBM3 series have not yet passed Nvidia's qualification for supply deals, according to one of the four sources and another person with knowledge of the discussion.\n\nIts setback in the AI chip race has also been noticed by investors, with its shares falling 7% this year, lagging SK Hynix and Micron which are up 17% and 14%, respectively.\n\nOn Wednesday, SK Hynix shares fell 2%, while Samsung rose 1%, beating a 0.4% rise in the broader market.\n\n(Reporting by Heekyong Yang, Joyce Lee in Seoul, Fanny Potkin in Singapore, Sam Nussey in Tokyo and Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Himani Sarkar)",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Surged (Again) Today. Is It too Late to Buy the Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) jumped again on Tuesday, adding to its ongoing winning streak this year. The stock gained ground as the trading day wore on and by the time the market closed, the stock was up 7.2%.\n\nThe broader market was decidedly mixed today, looking for direction, but the catalyst that helped send the chipmaker higher was strong quarterly results by Oracle(NYSE: ORCL). The company cited strong demand for AI-centric cloud services with demand far outstripping supply. Oracle also cited a recent cloud-infrastructure contract with Nvidia and hinted at more to come, saying \"We expect to have some very nice joint announcements with Nvidia next week,\" at the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which begins on Monday.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a buy?\n\nThis announcement adds to the growing mountain of evidence that the demand for generative AI is just getting started. Nvidia has nabbed the pole position by supplying the graphics processing units (GPUs) equipped to handle the rigors of AI processing. Furthermore, rivals have been unable to come up with a better solution, allowing Nvidia to dominate the field -- in two ways.\n\nFirst, Nvidia is the leading provider of the GPUs used in data centers, with a dominant 98% of the market, according to Wells Fargo analysts. Since the vast majority of AI computing is done in the cloud and data centers, this benefits Nvidia. Second, the company is also the go-to for processors used in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- controlling a 95% share of that market as well. This gives Nvidia an entrenched position, a clear advantage over would-be challengers.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia has delivered three consecutive quarters of record-setting growth, highlighted by triple-digit, year-over-year revenue and profit growth, with another triple-digit quarter on tap.\n\nThis leads to the quintessential investing question: Is Nvidia stock a buy. After the company's recent blockbuster earnings, Nvidia's valuation dropped significantly, currently trading for 36 times forward earnings. While that's a premium compared to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500, Nvidia's track record of blockbuster growth illustrates that its deserving of a premium.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt seems clear that the demand for AI will continue, with Nvidia sitting at the toll gate. This, in turn, will profit the company -- and investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 11, 2024\n\nDanny Vena has positions in Nvidia.

        "title": "How Nvidia’s billionaire CEO went from Denny’s dishwasher to leading a company with a $2 trillion market cap",
        "content": "Jensen Huang was once Denny’s “best dishwasher.”\n\n“I planned my work. I was organized. I was mise en place,” Huang said during a recent interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business. “I washed the living daylights out of those dishes.”\n\nNow he’s beating the living daylights out of the competition as president and CEO of Nvidia, the world’s premiere advanced chip manufacturer. He’s now worth nearly $82 billion, and the company he cofounded has a $2 trillion market cap.\n\nBut Huang attributes his wild success in business to the work ethic he picked up during his time with Denny’s as a dishwasher, before he was “promoted” to busboy.\n\n“I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang said. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I'm still working on being a good CEO.”\n\nHow Huang cofounded Nvidia\n\nHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963, moved to Thailand at age 5, and moved to Washington State in the U.S. when he was 9. He went to high school outside of Portland, Ore., where he started working for Denny’s at age 15, according to an Nvidia blog post. Huang then earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University, then went on to get his master’s in the same subject from Stanford University in 1992.\n\nNot only did Huang land his first job at Denny’s—but it’s also the place where he and two of his friends cooked up the idea that would make him a billionaire. In 1993, Huang, along with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem (who both worked at Sun Microsystems), met at what was one of Denny’s “most popular” locations in Northern California to discuss “creating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers,” according to the Nvidia blog post.\n\n“Chris and Curtis said one day they’d like to leave [Sun Microsystems], and they’d like me to go figure out what they’re going to leave for,” Huang said. “They insisted I figure out with them how to build a company.” But with little runway on how to build a business, Huang said he resolved to visit a bookstore to find books on starting a business and found one titled How to Write a Business Plan by Gordon Bell. But the issue was the book was 450 pages long.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Well, I never got through it. And not even close,” Huang said. “I flipped through a few pages and I go, ‘You know what, by the time I’m done reading this thing, I’ll be out of business.” So with that, Huang took to a Denny’s booth with his two friends to brainstorm a business.\n\nAt the time, Huang was working as an engineer with LSI Logic, a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that sold semiconductors and software. Avago Technologies acquired LSI Logic for $6.6 billion in 2014. But Huang kind of skips over that part when he’s telling his career story.\n\n“My first job before CEO was a dishwasher,” Huang said in the Stanford interview. “And I did that very well.”\n\nWhile at Denny’s that fateful night, Huang, Malachowsky, and Priem “polished off a Lumberjack Slam, Moons Over My Hammy, and a Super Bird sandwich—washed down with plenty of coffee,” according to Nvidia, the perfect fuel for masterminding a new technology. Now there’s a booth dedicated to Huang at an East San Jose Denny’s location.\n\n“The PC revolution was just getting going,” Huang said in the Stanford interview. “We thought, why don't we build a company that solves problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose computing can't. That became the company's mission.” Some of the industries “opened up,” Huang said, as a result of Nvidia’s technology, include computational drug design, weather simulation, materials design, robotics, self-driving cars—and the big one: artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia’s technology “enabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself—artificial intelligence as we know it today,” Huang said. “That was the journey.”\n\nHuang’s leadership advice\n\nWhile Nvidia has undoubtedly been developing the technology fueling the AI revolution, it had done so relatively quietly until just about a month ago. But in mid-February, its 46% stock surge pushed it past Amazon, adding about $560 billion in market value. Then Nvidia beat out Alphabet to become the third most valuable U.S. company. But there are some skeptics who think Nvidia may be overvalued. Apollo Global Management said that Nvidia’s inflated earnings are creating an AI bubble even “bigger than the 1990s tech bubble.”\n\nBut even as successful as Nvidia becomes, Huang consistently reflects on his humble beginnings. He tries to maintain a very flat structure at his company and lends a helping hand where he can. He says (counter to conventional business wisdom) that a CEO should have the most direct reports; he has 50.\n\n“No task is beneath me,” he said. “I used to be a dishwasher. I used to clean toilets. I cleaned a lot of toilets. I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined. And some of them you just can't unsee.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "With the broader indices gaining this year, the time is ripe to check on the best penny stocks on Robinhood.\n\nThe penny stock sector undoubtedly bears its own risks. But if played right, it can offer rewarding potential. For instance, shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) had no hope of surpassing the two-dollar barrier in the early 2000s. Yet this year, it reached its all-time high of $927.67, giving it a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Another example is Ford (NYSE:F), when it traded at less than $2 per share during the 2007–2008 worldwide financial crisis. Now, it’s changing hands for $12.11.\n\nWe will look at three penny stocks with similar potential and double-digit upsides you can purchase on Robinhood. The first pick benefits from wider crypto trends, the second from 5G, and the last from the aging American population. Each offers potentially astounding returns for risk-taking investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrypto miner Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is one of the top penny stocks on Robinhood, as Bitcoin and Ethereum zoom past $71,000 and $4,000, respectively.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner⁠ will be one of the main beneficiaries of the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bull run and the next halving. This event is why Bitcoin’s supply is literarily constrained at 21 million. The next one will occur in April. It is commonly observed that the news about the halving often results in a substantial price increase for Bitcoin and crypto stocks. BITF shares, which have already gained 191% over the last year, are in the spotlight.\n\nBitfarms held 804 bitcoins in its treasury as of the end of January. It mined 357 bitcoins in January and sold them all for $15.3 million.\n\nOperational capacity remained consistent with an end-of-month operating hash rate of 6.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). Plans include boosting capacity to 21 EH/s within the year. Additionally, Bitfarms will deploy 11,600 Bitmain T21 miners in Quebec and install 1,920 MicroBT M53S+ miners in Paraguay soon. Also, it has acquired land for a new mining facility in Paraguay.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Bitfarms added 3,888 S21s and 740 S21 hydro miners to its inventory. And, BITF executed options to buy 28,000 Bitmain T21 miners and 19,280 more, boosting its capacity. Moreover, Bitfarms has announced a $375 million at-the-market equity offering program, boosting shareholder returns at a critical stage​​.\n\nTipRanks data indicate that investors willing to buy this stock will potentially gain 86.19% in upside based on a mean target of $4.45.\n\nNokia (NOK) a backdrop featuring the Nokia logo with a mobile phone featuring the Nokia logo on its screen in the foreground\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNokia (NYSE:NOK) was once known for its mobile phone division. However, after losing the race for mobile supremacy to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it pivoted to 5G technology, cloud, and network services.\n\nThanks to investments in 5G, it aims for a double-digit operating margin and a net sales target of around 10 billion Euro by 2026. It focuses on enterprise customers, Cloud RAN, O-RAN, and the defense sector.\n\nThe company wants to evolve its operating model by emphasizing SaaS and Networks as Code. In doing so, it will gain access to consistent recurring cash flow. Nokia investors could also take advantage of the Finnish multinational’s novel merchandise introductions. In addition to the XR20 and G50 phones, NOK is rolling out two more products—G400 and C200 models.\n\nNokia’s patent licensing agreements with key industry participants such as Apple also demonstrate a forward-thinking approach. NOK certainly needs these initiatives to work since the stock is down 22.1% on a one-year basis. It is coming off four quarters of disappointing analyst estimates.\n\nHowever, estimates indicate the stock has a 30% upside potential from current rates, making it one of the best penny stocks to buy on Robinhood.\n\nClover Health Investments (CLOV) Clover Health logo on a phone screen in front of a computer screen showing a map where their services reach. CLOV stock.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock\n\nClover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV) is one of the best penny stocks to buy on Robinhood if you want to invest in a future-oriented healthcare play.\n\nThe company provides Medicare Advantage insurance plans, aiming to slash costs and improve healthcare outcomes. CLOV is targeting the global Medicare Advantage market. The latter was valued at $456.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $758.5 billion through 2032, according to an analysis from Custom Market Insights.\n\nPlus, the U.S. is aging rapidly, with people 65 and older jumping from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050. As a result, the total number of Medicare beneficiaries will keep growing, proving CLOV stock positive tailwinds.\n\nMeanwhile, the last three quarters have been earnings-beat quarters. Clover Health Investments targets Adjusted EBITDA profitability for the entire fiscal 2024. This will enable it to leverage its technology platform, Clover Assistant. Analysts are projecting an 82.6% upside for the stock based on a mean target price of $1.44.\n\nUnder these circumstances, CLOV establishes itself well among the best penny stocks on Robinhood.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Finding the next multi-bagger investment isn’t as easy as staking all your cash on a Fabulous Four stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or playing it safe by index investing. Instead, the key to long-term, massive gains is finding speculative stocks with potential that the market is overlooking.\n\nIn a nutshell, you’re like an investor buying into Nvidia in 2013 when shares traded in penny stock territory: you have a vision of the future and have found a speculative stock that fits that vision. More importantly, you have the conviction to wait out turbulence with massive gains on the horizon.\n\nWhile these stocks may not be the next Nvidia, each is cornering an important and emerging market with massive potential. As early movers in their respective spaces, these speculative stocks remain under the radar — for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBraze (BRZE) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nManaging marketing in today’s digital creator economy is tough when you consider the many platforms, customer expectations across channels, and sheer scope of a well-integrated marketing campaign. Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) is a speculative stock that helps customers better manage marketing efforts. Shockingly, most investors don’t have this mid-cap speculative stock on their radar even though it boasts mega-clients like Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), NASCAR and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).\n\nIn a nutshell, Braze leverages user data to better personalize advertising across platforms. It creates a coherent thread for the potential customer while helping the advertiser track spending and return on ad sales more efficiently. Braze is also one of the few companies effectively using customer-facing artificial intelligence (AI) integration tools. That’s in contrast to companies slapping an “AI” label on anything and everything with a hint of automation, whether or not the label is appropriate.\n\nA newer company expanding as rapidly as possible, Braze isn’t yet turning a profit. But the company’s strong revenue growth, high subscription revenue rate (95%) and a notable client book prove this speculative stock has a bright future. Even if it remains under the radar for now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsara (IOT) A close-up shot of a tablet screen with \"IOT\" text and related emoticons in a connected web.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe “Internet of Things” is a well-known trope by now, but for many the phrase conjures up thoughts of connected refrigerators and home alarm systems. While valid, those are just a slice of the overall IoT sector. However, speculative stock Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is scaling the concept to serve enterprise and industrial operations more effectively. Samsara primarily targets fleet, transportation and heavy equipment to manage operational workflows, track movement and improve overall safety.\n\nSamsara just marked a record-setting year in its most recent report, nailing 39% year-over-year (YoY) recurring revenue growth. Recurring customer counts climbed 49% and brought in a respectable $27 million in free cash flow. Most importantly, Samsara is a relatively new firm bringing an equally nascent tech to market. It means the firm’s upward possibilities are endless as they increase market penetration and begin scaling to meet growing clients by targeting the bigger fish currently just out of their reach.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) ecommerce company nogin, NOGN stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer e-commerce is as popular as ever post-pandemic, with giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) leading the way. GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) operates similarly but carves out its niche by focusing on the vast B2B market. It aims to be the ultimate platform for businesses to source products and handle all related vendor, product and sourcing management tasks.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud provides a comprehensive suite of services tailored for the scaled B2B e-commerce market, including a vibrant vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and notably, secure cross-border payment facilitation.\n\nThe company’s price-to-earnings ratio stands out for its low value, at just 19x, starkly contrasting with the tech sector’s average ratio of 36x. This disparity becomes even more pronounced when considering GigaCloud’s earnings growth, which saw earnings per share double over the past four quarters. Moreover, the company maintains robust free cash flow per share and trades at an exceptionally low 0.68x sales, highlighting its status as a highly undervalued speculative stock in today’s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in BRZE.

        "title": "Why SoundHound AI, Nvidia, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Rallied Today",
        "content": "There's little question that the catalyst that sparked the current bull market rally is artificial intelligence (AI). The AI gold rush that kicked off last year is gathering steam, but market watchers continue to question the resilience of this upward momentum. However, robust results from one company provided a lift for a number of AI stocks.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, audio AI specialist SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) surged 13.6%, chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 4.9%, and social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) climbed 2.4%, as of 1:47 p.m. ET.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- turned up nothing in the way of catalysts to explain the move higher. This seems to suggest that it was the results of another company that drove AI stocks upward. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEvidence the adoption of AI is spreading\n\nThe catalyst that seems to have sparked a rally among AI stocks was a surprisingly strong earnings report from database specialist Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The results provided evidence that demand for AI is spreading.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), Oracle reported revenue of $13.3 billion, which grew 7% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, up 16%. While that might not seem like much to write home about, the devil is in the details, with two items of particular interest.\n\nOracle's cloud revenue was the headliner, growing 25% year over year to $5.1 billion. Even more impressive was the company's cloud infrastructure results, which climbed 52% year over year. This outpaced the growth of Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure -- also known as the \"Big Three\" cloud providers -- which grew 13%, 26%, and 30%, respectively. This suggests that either Oracle took market share from its closest cloud competitors, or that demand for cloud services is growing -- though both could be true.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or contractually obligated sales not yet booked as revenue, surged 29% to $80 billion. Since RPO gives insight in future revenue trends, this suggests Oracle's sales growth seems destined to continue.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz also noted that AI cloud capacity \"substantially exceeds supply.\" As a result, Oracle is \"opening new and expanding existing cloud data centers very, very rapidly.\"\n\nThe chief executive also noted the company recently signed a \"big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with Nvidia\" in the third quarter, but also hinted there's more on the docket. \"We expect to have some very nice joint announcements with Nvidia next week\" during Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC).\n\nThis all but confirms that it was the accelerating demand for AI that boosted Oracle's results, which has broader implications for other companies in the AI space.\n\nProfiting from AI\n\nWe're only just beginning to comprehend just how prevalent generative AI will be, but these highlighted companies have each carved out a niche for themselves in the AI gold rush:\n\nSoundHound AI creates AI-powered voice and audio solutions serving the restaurant and automotive industries. The company's tools can be used for restaurant drive-thrus, phone banks, and self-serve kiosks, among others. Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) with the computational horsepower required by AI systems. The company has generated triple-digit year-over-year sales growth in each of the preceding three quarters thanks to growing demand for AI. Meta Platforms has long used AI to advance its business, surfacing relevant content to its social media users, as well as directing its targeted advertising efforts. Meta also developed LLaMA AI, one of the most in-demand large language models available on the major cloud infrastructure sites.\n\nEach of these stocks is relatively inexpensive, depending on your favored valuation metric. Meta and Nvidia currently sell for 25 times and 36 times forward earnings, respectively, making them the standout choices -- particularly given their history of strong growth. SoundHound AI isn't yet profitable and sells for 20 times sales, making it more expensive and certainly riskier.\n\nThe trend toward AI adoption is unmistakable, offering investors plenty of ways to profit from the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "There's something special about finding \"the next big thing\" before that thing goes mainstream. Tom and David Gardner recommended Amazon.com and Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) years before those online innovators were cool. Without those astute insights, The Motley Fool might not have existed today.\n\nOr you can look at my personal history. I dove headlong into that brand-new \"Internet\" thing in 1995, spending every spare moment in my Swedish college's computer rooms to explore the rudimentary world wide web at dial-up speeds. Two years later, I had met a girl in an online game and transferred to her school in Florida, working out the whole transfer process by email.\n\nBy the end of the millennium, the office of admissions at my new school wanted me to stay after graduation as their webmaster. And in 2024, I'm still married to that American girl I met on an Icelandic game server 29 years ago and all my work is online. Let's just say that the internet has been a game-changer for me.\n\nI'm no future-telling oracle, but I did have the foresight to follow the Gardner brothers' advice years before joining the Motley Fool's writing crew. And just as I was early to the digital revolution, I may have found two companies currently poised for remarkable long-term growth, similar to the early days of Amazon and Netflix.\n\nRoku took a bottom-line hit in recent years -- on purpose\n\nAs it happens, the first name on my list used to be a subsidiary of Netflix. Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) started life as the designer of set-top boxes that could move Netflix's video-streaming experience from laptop screens to living-room TVs.\n\nThe DVD-mailer king struggled in the transition to digital video streams, but astute investors who bought Netflix stock during the Qwikster storm have been handsomely rewarded in the long run. For example, the shares I picked up at the end of October 2011 have gained almost exactly 5,000% so far.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch like Netflix's stock in 2011, Roku's share price is down on unreasonable grounds nowadays. Bearish investors worry about the usual headline numbers -- Roku's sales growth slowed down in 2022 and 2023 while bottom-line earnings dipped into negative numbers. But -- stop me if you've heard this before -- these undesirable financial trends simply reflected how Roku chose to conduct its business during the inflation-tinged economic downturn.\n\nMany companies raised prices in an effort to pass their increased expenses on to their customers. Roku didn't contribute to the inflationary trend that way. Instead, the company held prices steady in order to win more end-market customers and a larger market share during this difficult period.\n\nAs a result, Roku is selling streaming devices below cost. You can call it a marketing expense if you like, and an effective one. The number of active Roku accounts rose from 70 million names in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 80 million users one year later. Chart source: Roku's Q4 2023 earnings report.\n\nOh, and Roku may report negative earnings but its cash profits are positive and rising. The company converted 5% of its 2023 revenues into free cash flows, reflecting generous amounts of stock-based compensation and video content amortization. Keep in mind that cash flows show the movement of actual cash in and out of a company's bank accounts, while earnings are an accounting construct related to tax reporting. So I don't mind low or negative earnings alongside robust cash flows -- that's just clever accounting that keeps tax expenses low.\n\nDigital advertising is coming back from the inflation crisis at its own sluggish pace, with the media and entertainment (M&E) sector lagging behind the ad-buying market at large. That's bad news for Roku, who generates most of its revenues from ad sales with an outsized contribution from the M&E sector. But no downturn lasts forever and I think it's both shortsighted and unfair to reduce your calculation of Roku's long-term value based on a temporary challenge.\n\nYet, the M&E advertising headwind and negative earnings still dominate the stock market's thinking about Roku and its stock. Share prices stand more than 85% below the all-time highs from the summer of 2021 and 40% down from the annual peaks in November 2023. You can pick up Roku shares at the modest valuation of 2.7 times sales.\n\nThat's a bargain in my book, more suitable for a slow-growth cash machine than an early stage growth phenom. One of these lines is not like the other, and I think it's just a matter of time before Wall Street gets back to its senses. Roku deserves a much richer valuation and the company has many years of greenfield growth opportunities ahead. You don't want to be left empty-handed when this goofy discount pricing ends: ROKU PS Ratio Chart\n\nAI-powered voice controls\n\nNext, let's take a quick look at SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN). This company provides voice control and audio analytics software and services to auto makers, drive-through restaurants, any business with a phone-based menu system, and more. For example, SoundHound AI has managed the voice-control functions in Netflix's reference design for set-top boxes since 2019.\n\nIts software relies on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) engines, trained on two decades of song identification services and an ongoing stream of fresh voice-control commands.\n\nSoundHound AI's deep learning systems produce a better user experience than simpler systems with basic speech-to-text interpretation. And the company has a modest approach to its brand so far -- customers are typically free to skip the SoundHound AI and Houndify branding altogether and present their tweaked voice control systems under their own brand names.\n\nSo you may never notice that you're using a SoundHound AI service when talking to ChatGPT in your Stellantis car or ordering burgers at the local White Castle drive-through. Whether you know it or not, that's the Houndify platform at work, and the client network is growing larger over time.\n\nThis is still a very small company, barely scratching the surface of a massive global market. SoundHound AI's revenues stopped at $46 million in fiscal year 2023, but the company has a backlog of unfilled orders and long-term contracts worth $661 million. That backlog doubled in size last year.\n\nSo SoundHound AI is building a rocket engine to drive years and years of terrific business growth. The stock recently soared as AI technology giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)revealed a small investment in SoundHound AI, but the stock still trades more than 20% below the price of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2021. With currently tiny revenue streams supported by $661 million in firm long-term order bookings, the stock may look expensive from a simple price-to-sales perspective but affordable in light of the robust bookings backlog.\n\nAnd don't forget that voice control and audio analysis specialists have a history of attracting buyout offers. Shazam is an Apple subsidiary since 2018. Nuance Communications joined forces with Microsoft four years later. I can imagine a bidding war breaking out over SoundHound AI if another couple of tech giants want to get an instant foot in the voice-control door without doing decades of advanced voice-based AI research.\n\nBoth SoundHound AI and Roku look deeply undervalued right now, especially when you consider the absolutely gigantic target markets they are pursuing. I can't promise that either one will follow in the market-beating footsteps of Amazon and Netflix, but their growth prospects have inspired me to buy both stocks in recent months.\n\nThese spicy growth stocks may not be your cup of tea, but they have a lot in common with how Netflix inspired me in 2011 and Amazon caught David Gardner's eye in 2002.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is not over. Companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) are generating staggering returns on the back of excellent and ever-growing financial metrics. Yet, AI stocks are becoming increasingly crowded and expensive, with everyone clamoring to get a slice. Prudent investors are starting to look further afield for undervalued AI stocks—which might be harder than it sounds since almost every tech company is moving into the AI space. That is why we’ve collated the three most promising and undervalued AI stocks and laid out why you should consider them as your next buy.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCompanies that offer AI-powered supply chain management are in for a great year. Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) does that and more, offering robotic software and hardware platforms that map out storage or distribution facilities and automate packing, storage, and retrieval functions. The company aims to reduce delivery time from providers to end users through its Symbiotic platform, regardless of the scale of operations. SYM provides services to distribution centers for groceries, general merchandise, wholesale food, footwear, apparel, and food and beverage suppliers.\n\nSo, let me explain why SYM is a great undervalued AI stock. First, its stock currently trades at around $44, while analysts give it a strong buy recommendation and about a $20 upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSecond, the company is doing quite well financially. Their latest reports showcased an almost 80% increase in revenue YoY, from $206 million to $369 million. The company is still operating at a net loss—$13 million, to be exact. However, it’s already registered its second quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA, signaling a move toward profitability. In line with these positive results, management is confident that the trend will continue in Q2 2024. Revenue is expected to fall between $400 million and $420 million, and adjusted EBITDA is expected to end between $12 million and $15 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath Inc (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike with Symbiotic, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) is offering automation platforms. However, PATH is focused on the workforce and enterprise institutions. Its SaaS platform provides several resources, including “Discover” (process, task, and communications mining, prioritizing data analysis for sales and KPI opportunities), “Automate” (UI and API automation, generative AI, and process automation), and “Operate” (real-time analytics and unified management platforms).\n\nThe company’s services cover various industries and specialties, including banking, healthcare, and insurance. It also provides department-specific automation services, like HR, IT, and customer service.\n\nWhat makes me bullish about PATH is its improving financials. Q3’24 reported a 24% YoY growth for both revenue and ARR. ARR, in particular, reached $1.38 billion. A closer look into its financials indicates a consistent ARR growth, with an estimated 35% CAGR going back to 2022.\n\nIts customer base is also growing, with the number of large customers spending $100k yearly reaching 1,947. Meanwhile, million-dollar customers have grown from 201 to 264 YoY. The company’s guidance reflects this growth; revenue is anticipated to reach $381 million and $386 million next quarter, while ARR is expected to reach $1.455 billion on the high end.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is the reigning king of AI stocks, and anything it touches turns to gold. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the many companies Nvidia is invested in, potentially making it a great addition to your undervalued AI stocks list.\n\nSOUND offers an Only Voice AI platform to deliver more natural conversations to users. Its platform stands out, as it performs natural language processing and automatic speech recognition simultaneously, providing faster and more accurate answers. SOUN’s platform can be used for restaurant order-taking, hospitality management, marketing, transcription, automatic content recognition, and more.\n\nIt also has a music app that can identify songs sung by the user. That music app might seem small in the grand scheme of things, but the underlying technology is impressive and showcases the platform’s capability and potential applications.\n\nNow – it would be unfair to recommend SOUN solely because of its ties with Nvidia. The thing is, SoundHouse stands on its own two feet just fine. Revenue reached $17.15 million last quarter, signifying an impressive 80% growth YoY. Like with early startups, the company is still operating at a loss, yet we’re seeing narrowing numbers that are getting closer to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA also registered an 80% improvement. To top it all off, analysts are recommending it as a strong buy, with more than 50% potential upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With patience, undervalued semiconductor stocks could easily race to higher highs.\n\nJust look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example. Since the start of 2023, the tech giant ran from a low of about $150 to a high of $974. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ran from about $110 to $227.\n\nAnd now — surprise, surprise — they’re pulling back on stretched valuations, and as ridiculous bouts of greed give way to fear. At the same time, I don’t expect the pullbacks to last long at all. With growing, explosive demand for semiconductors, I still believe Nvidia and Advanced Micro could race to higher highs along with some of the less-crowded, undervalued semiconductor names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe also have to consider that with growing demand, the global semiconductor market could be worth nearly $1.4 trillion from $527.9 billion in 2021, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. Plus, demand isn’t slowing. Instead, industry giants, like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) are increasing production as demand grows.\n\nThat being said, I’d use weakness as an opportunity for buying the big leaguers as well as some of the most undervalued semiconductor stocks, including:\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the most undervalued semiconductor stocks, Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) is a global provider of test systems for burning-in and testing logic, optical and memory integrated circuits.\n\nFor quite some time, AEHR benefited by providing testing equipment and services for the electric vehicle market. And as demand for EVs accelerated, so did AEHR stock. Unfortunately, with slowing EV sales growth, shares plummeted from about $50 to less than $16.22 a share. But don’t count the stock out just yet.\n\nFor one, when the Federal Reserve does start to cut interest rates, we could see a resurgence of EV sales. That could benefit AEHR.\n\nTwo, according to Bloomberg, the EV market could see about 22% growth this year, noting. “We expect global passenger EV sales — battery-electrics and plug-in hybrids — to increase 21% in 2024 to 16.7 million, with 70% of those being fully electric.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd last, while the company did reduce guidance earlier this year, “AEHR remains confident about its long-term prospects and about the future demand for its solutions. The company has maintained its long-term growth expectations and sees a huge opportunity ahead of it,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nLattice Semiconductor (LSCC) a computer chip. Chip Stocks to Buy Now\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNext up on this list of undervalued semiconductor stocks is Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC).\n\nFor one, Lattice focuses onfield programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which are under heavy demand. So much so, that there have been multiple FPGA acquisitions. Among them is AMD’s acquisition of Xilinx back in 2022, as noted by Motley Fool contributors.\n\nTwo, while the company has been dealing with oversupply issues, it expects for conditions to improve in the second half of the year as customer inventories return to normal. Three, CEO James Anderson believes LSCC will remain profitable in coming quarters.\n\nHelping, late last year, Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of LSCC with a buy rating, with a $70 price target. “In the near-term, Lattice is unlikely to stave off cyclical headwinds facing the broader industry, but any downside is likely already priced into shares,” said the firm, as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nIn addition, LSCC authorized a $250 million share buyback program through the end of December 2024. So while LSCC stock recently ran from about $55 to $80, I believe it could retest $98 as it rights the ship.\n\nDirexion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (SOXL) Button with the word risk pointing between medium and high level, 3D render suitable for risk management or decision-making process situation. represents risk tolerance\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWith the latest pullback in semiconductor stocks likely to be short-lived, we can also take advantage of weakness by using an ETF such as the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares (NYSEARCA:SOXL). With an expense ratio of 0.94%, SOXL seeks daily investment results of 300% of the performance of the NYSE Semiconductor Index. Some of the index’s top holdings include AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nAfter bottoming out around $15 in early November, the ETF ran to a high of about $57. It’s now trading around $46 with profit-taking in major semiconductor names. But again, I don’t expect the pullback to last long with the artificial intelligence boom fueling demand for semiconductors.\n\nBut use extreme caution with triple-levered funds like SOXL. These ETFs are looking for 300% returns on a daily basis. They are constantly rebalancing their portfolios. You need acute precision buying and selling this ETF to make any money. The levered ETFs are designed for day traders. Even Direxion says they are not for everyone. They “should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.” Tread carefully here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

However, I believe these three have even better outlooks. The chart above, which shows the three-month relative performance actually displays quite clearly which are my favored stocks.\n\nWe can see that Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN have the best performance and have outpaced the broad market. Not surprisingly, they are also the three stocks that boast Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nNvidia: The Undisputed King of AI\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise isn't just a hot stock; it's fueled by impressive earnings growth. While its premium valuation is justified to some extent, it isn't yet in bubble territory. Nvidia's future hinges on the continued momentum of the AI revolution, a field where they hold undisputed dominance.\n\nThis dominance is further solidified by their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with upward trending earnings revisions. For investors seeking exposure to disruptive AI technology, Nvidia offers a compelling case.\n\nNvidia’s stock is clearly being carried higher by momentum, but those calling for bubble valuations clearly aren’t looking closely at the data. NVDA has a forward earnings multiple of 39.4x, which is below the industry average and below its 10-year median of 41.2x.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon: Multifaceted Technology Enterprise\n\nAmazon remains the undisputed king of online shopping, consistently delivering growth in its core business. But that's just one facet of this diversified giant.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a major revenue driver and enjoys a dominant market position in cloud computing. Additionally, their often-underestimated advertising business has exploded, significantly contributing to their overall profitability. The ad business now adds $60 billion annually to the top line.\n\nWith a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the second-highest projected EPS growth (28.1% annually) of the group, Amazon presents an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to both established and innovative companies.\n\nMeta Platforms: Always Underestimated\n\nDefying expectations in 2023, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) emerged as the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500. This impressive feat underscores their underlying strength and potential.\n\nUnder CEO Mark Zuckerberg's leadership, the company has undergone a successful transformation, becoming a leaner, more efficient operation. This focus translates to sustained profitability, further bolstered by their product suite reaching a staggering 3.14 billion daily active users.\n\nMeta Platforms also hold an early lead in the burgeoning VR/AR space, positioning them well for future growth. Their commitment to shareholder value through a new dividend payout program further sweetens the deal for investors seeking a balance between growth and stability.\n\nMeta Platforms has EPS growth forecasts of 19.5% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nMicrosoft: On the Cusp\n\nMicrosoft MSFT is a close contender for the top dog group but is hindered by an above average historical valuation. But with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, it may defy the high valuation and continue higher anyway.\n\nOne major advantage for Microsoft lies in its partnership with OpenAI, granting them a significant lead in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This partnership has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of Microsoft's products and services.\n\nMicrosoft is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 34.8x, which is well above its 10-year median of 25.7x. It could be argued that its strong positioning in AI could have earned it a more premium multiple, but that is still unclear.\n\nSomething worth noting is that Microsoft currently has a very compelling technical trading setup, which may be a catalyst to push it higher. MSFT stock is on the verge of breaking out from this bull flag. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple, Alphabet and Tesla\n\nThis group is dealing with some more near-term challenges. Firstly, each of them has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, indicating a mixed earnings revisions trend. If any of them were to experience some earnings estimates upgrades, it would go a long way in putting them higher in this list, as the Zacks rank clearly has an advantage in picking winning stocks.\n\nApple AAPL is currently dealing with an elevated valuation, while also addressing issues of business concentration. The iPhone makes up such a large percentage of total sales, that investors have become a bit concerned about that being a risk.\n\nThis seems to be getting addressed though as its services segment has been growing into a cash cow, and its venture into AR/VR with the Apple Vision Pro shows its effort to branch out into innovative new verticals.\n\nAs AAPL stock rolls over some more it will become a compelling investment option.\n\nAlphabet GOOGL, while boasting one of the most advantageous and dominant businesses with search is also running into some issues. Growth has slowed considerably for the tech giant, and annual sales growth has fallen into the single digits.\n\nAdditionally, management seems to be floundering as business innovation suffers and the company bloats to an unreasonable size.\n\nAlphabet is trading at a very appealing valuation though, well below its historical median of 26.2x. I think this could make GOOGL a candidate for activist investors. If Alphabet can get a bit of a shakeup, and boost earnings growth, it will again be a worthy top dog. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor me, Tesla TSLA is much more of a conundrum, and I never felt I had a strong feel for the stock. Over the last several months, Tesla stock has really cratered. This is especially concerning because is has been a banner period for the broader technology industry. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSales growth has been stalling, and electric vehicle competition has been growing, so for me the picture is a bit more uncertain than the other stocks.\n\nOr course, those who bet against Elon Musk have not done well, and he could most certainly shift this uncertainty. Namely, the development of humanoid robots, which Musk has been teasing online for the last few months could be a world changing product.\n\nWhile major innovation would be fun, what Tesla really needs to see is upward trending earnings revisions. However, as can be seen below, that is not the case and analysts have unanimously downgraded forecasts.\n\nUntil this can improve, Tesla is definitely at the bottom of the list. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represents a diverse landscape of opportunities. Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms stand out for their exceptional growth potential and strong fundamentals. These top performers offer compelling investment options for those seeking exposure to the leading forces shaping the digital revolution.\n\nHowever, carefully consider the challenges faced by Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla before making investment decisions. Remember, thorough research and understanding each company's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for success.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 15 best retirement stocks to buy according to the media. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy According to the Media.\n\nThere is increased investor interest in the American stock market as growth metrics make headlines after a macro slowdown in the past two years. Investors have been given confidence as prospects of lowered rates serve to boost the major indexes to swing upwards. For example, the S&P 500 is up more than 8% in the past two months, the NASDAQ Composite is up close to 9%, and the Dow Jones has registered gains of around 3%. This is quite extraordinary given the contraction of the indexes in the past few months as rates went up.\n\nThere are several other reasons for investors to be optimistic about the health of the US stock market. Inflation figures have started showing signs of slowing down, consumer spending is holding steady, the labor market remains resilient as ever, and financial experts have come together to predict that the US will be able to avoid a major recession. As the market normalizes, big companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are all performing exceptionally well.\n\nThese firms have been able to withstand inflationary pressures and emerge stronger than ever from the crisis of the past two years. Generally, the three firms mentioned above are considered safe stocks for a retirement portfolio since they have established businesses, a solid track record of dividend payouts, and a steady growth profile. Joaquin Duato, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), recently gave an insight into the future plans of his company, at the fourth quarter earnings call, that might be of interest to investors.\n\n“As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our enterprise business review, we shared that we expect our innovative medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for Tremfya in IBD; Erleada in early stage prostate cancer; our targeted oral peptide, JNJ-2113 in psoriasis; nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis; as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder.\n\nWe also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804, in psoriatic arthritis; nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease; and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In medtech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we'll see strong progress toward these goals.” [read the full earnings call transcript here]\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we scoured the top retirement stock picks as recommended by prominent financial websites like The Motley Fool, Forbes, KipLinger, Investopedia, Morningstar, Zacks, Market Watch, and Business Insider. The top twenty consensus picks were then selected. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. Best Retirement Stocks to Buy According to the Media\n\nPhoto by Diana Parkhouse on Unsplash\n\nBest Retirement Stocks to Buy According to the Media\n\n15. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a New York-based multinational telecommunication firm. On January 30, investment advisory Citi maintained a Buy rating on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stock and raised the price target to $47 from $45.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) with 5.9 million shares worth more than $225 million.\n\nJust like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is one of the best retirement stocks to buy according to the media.\n\n14. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. On February 5, investment advisory RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock and raised the price target to $190 from $185.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 71 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $21.6 billion in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 72 in the preceding quarter worth $21.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Diamond Hill, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Other bottom contributors included Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Carrier Global and Becton, Dickinson. Shares of integrated oil and gas company Chevron were pressured as global oil production is growing — particularly in the US, which has now surpassed its past production levels — in turn pressuring oil prices and company profit margins.”\n\n13. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 85\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 1\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas. On January 23, investment advisory UBS maintained a Buy rating on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stock and lowered the price target to $132 from $133.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Lauderdale, New York-based investment firm First Eagle Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) with 13 million shares worth more than $1.3 billion.\n\n12. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)provides enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, consolidate, manage, and automate services for enterprises worldwide. On January 26, investment advisory Citi maintained a Buy rating on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stock and raised the price target to $896 from $862.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC is a leading shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with 579,655 shares worth more than $409 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) offers cloud-based solutions that improve workflow efficiency through automation and digitalization. The stock rose 26.4% in the fourth quarter, finishing the year up 82.0%. Stock appreciation was supported by strong quarterly results above expectations with 24.5% year-over-year subscription revenue growth in constant currency and 30% non-GAAP operating margins despite ongoing macro complexities. In addition, the stock benefited from growing investor expectations that the company would benefit from the integration of GenAI technology into its products, and a rise in software stocks more broadly. Management noted that key business drivers included strong traction with government customers, improving momentum with new customers, and budget consolidation into platforms like ServiceNow. In addition, the company launched its GenAI-supported product line, sold under a new higher-priced Pro Plus sku, at the end of the quarter and has already signed on multiple customers with hundreds more in the pipeline. The new product line should generate material efficiencies for customers as it improves their ability to automate and digitize, and hence we expect broader adoption of the Pro Plus sku, creating an additional growth engine for ServiceNow, supporting the company’s long duration of growth.”\n\n11. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nNumber of Times Stock Appeared in Top Picks of Financial Media: 2\n\nThe Home Depot, Inc.

(NYSE:HD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“We updated the sustainable scorecard for The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) and maintained our Above Average Rating. Home Depot’s corporate responsibilities focus on three pillars: focusing on its people, operating sustainably, and strengthening its communities. Home Depot continues to focus on its people by investing billions of dollars in wages, training, and benefit enhancement.

The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super- computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of Al and therefore critical to Al adoption, in our view. During the period, shares contributed to performance as Nvidia reported solid fiscal third quarter results well above analyst expectations, driven by strong demand from data centers. Growing Al data center workloads are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.”\n\n7.

(NYSE:V) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Mastercard is a company that pretty much everyone has heard of. In fact, when we meet with Ensemble’s clients, we occasionally tell them that we’re nearly certain that they are carrying a Mastercard in their wallet or purse as we speak, and if not, they are carrying a Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Most people carry both.\n\nPeople carry Mastercard and Visa because they are accepted nearly everywhere in developed markets. And they are accepted in most emerging economies, at least at locations where higher income people spend money. As a shopper you can show up at a bodega in Peru, a high end hotel in Tokyo, a truck stop in Alabama, or an ice cream cart in Milan, show them a piece of plastic and they’ll let you walk away with goods and services without any worry that they aren’t going to get paid…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n6.

        "content": "It's been a fantastic 2023 thus far for the stock market. The S&P 500 is up more than 7% year to date, and many key indexes are once again notching new all-time highs. This strong widespread performance raises the question: Which stock is most overdue for a stock split?\n\nGranted, there are plenty of candidates thanks to the powerful rally in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nevertheless, I think the answer is clear. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the stock most in need of a stock split. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy it's time for Nvidia to split its stock\n\nFirst things first: Stock splits tend to happen when share prices go up. And boy, oh boy, Nvidia shares soared over the last 18 months. Indeed, the stock is up a remarkable 650% since October 2022. In dollar terms, the share price has risen from $112 to over $875. NVDA Chart\n\nAnd while its skyrocketing share price is certainly a good thing for Nvidia, it does cause a few problems for the company and the appeal of its stock.\n\nFirst off, many retail investors are turned off by high-priced stocks. Pricey stocks might be out of reach for investors with modest portfolios, or those who can't stomach the thought of a single share of stock costing almost $1,000.\n\nSecond, when a company's share price approaches $1,000, it often wants to enact a stock split for another reason: stock-based compensation (SBC).\n\nFor many companies, particularly tech businesses, SBC is a critical piece of overall employee compensation. When share prices are high, SBC can become more difficult to fine-tune given how expensive each share is. Accordingly, companies often split their stock to award \"more\" shares to employees, even if that doesn't translate into larger SBC bonuses.\n\nHow likely is Nvidia to split its shares?\n\nIf history is any guide, it's quite likely that Nvidia will split its shares soon. The company has enacted five stock splits over its lifetime as a publicly traded company.  NVDA ChartNVDA data by YCharts\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most recent split happened in 2021, when the company split its shares 4-for-1. Prior to the announcement of its split, Nvidia's shares were trading around $560. In the run-up to the split itself, shares increased to over $800.\n\nIs Nvidia a buy now?\n\nFor long-term investors, I think there is still plenty of time to buy Nvidia. The AI revolution will play out over a decade or more, meaning Nvidia will reap the benefits of its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) for years to come.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia stock remains affordable despite its lofty share price. For example, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is 36, below its three-year average of 43. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIn short, Nvidia might be red-hot, but that doesn't mean the shares will cool down anytime soon. What's more, another stock split could happen in the near future, driving even more retail interest in one of Wall Street's most popular names.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's Price Just Keeps Growing -- Is It Headed for a Stock Split?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock looks unstoppable. Amid the company's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI)-ready chips and the insatiable demand for the technology, its stock has risen by close to 300% over the last 12 months.\n\nWith the stock approaching $1,000 per share, investors may wonder whether a stock split is imminent. Despite the fact that such a move will not directly influence Nvidia's valuation, investors should expect one soon. Here's why.\n\nNvidia and stock splits\n\nThe history of Nvidia stock is arguably the most compelling reason for expecting a near-term split. The company has split its stock five times since 2000, one of which has occurred since AI and data centers renewed investor interest in GPUs.\n\nThat previous split occurred on July 19, 2021, when Nvidia carried out a 4-for-1 stock split. Interestingly, it closed at a pre-split price of around $744 per share that day, a level lower than today's current price.\n\nStill, investors should remember that these gains came quickly, as Nvidia stock is up about 85% this year and nearly 30% over the last month alone, indicating that a need for a split could have caught the company's board off guard.\n\nThe big question surrounding the split\n\nMoreover, the most significant question surrounding a split is likely where the company will set the split ratio. The most recent 4-for-1 split was the largest ratio in the company's history, with the company having approved three 2-for-1 splits and one 3-for-2 split in the 2000s.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, the more recent growth has probably exceeded expectations. While future growth may not match the 126% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), analysts forecast 81% revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and 22% the next fiscal year, indicating the massive profit increases should continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nThat could possibly mean the stock price is not done rising. Conversely, slowing growth could soon dampen enthusiasm for the stock, and the company's board will have to consider the massive drops in the stock price in past years. Hence, the company has to be ready for any potential price movement when it decides the split ratio.\n\nStory continues NVDA Chart\n\nAnother possible consideration\n\nInvestors may want also to consider another possible factor -- inclusion as one of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe S&P Dow Jones Indices, operated by S&P Global, has not telegraphed any intention to add Nvidia to the Dow 30. Also, the index already includes two semiconductor stocks, Apple and Intel.\n\nHowever, Intel has struggled in recent years, increasing the chances of its removal. Also, AI's influence over the economy could lead to more tech stocks in the index, and Nvidia's $2.2 trillion market cap makes it a likely choice.\n\nFurthermore, the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index. Since the nominal share price determines a stock's weighting on the Dow, companies have often initiated stock splits to reduce their influence over the index. Should Nvidia seek a place on the Dow 30, it may alter the split ratio to increase its chances of inclusion.\n\nMaking sense of a potential stock split\n\nGiven the company's history of stock splits, investors should expect such a move sooner rather than later. Also, since the previous split occurred less than three years ago at a lower price, the split ratio is likely the most significant question surrounding such a move.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia's board will need to consider the stock's price history in deciding the ratio, both in a positive and negative sense. Also, assuming Nvidia seeks to become a Dow 30 stock, it will have to become more sensitive to its nominal share price.\n\nUltimately, the stock split changes nothing for Nvidia on the surface. However, given the company's history, shareholders should anticipate a split and, possibly, increased interest in the stock from some unexpected parties.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Investors Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, one of Wall Street's few constants is that there's always a next-big-thing trend or innovation garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, no trend is captivating the attention and pocketbooks of investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhen discussing \"AI,\" I'm talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally manage. However, the true value of AI is seen with the incorporation of machine learning, which allows AI software and systems to evolve over time so they can become more efficient at their tasks.\n\nLast year, researchers at PwC released a report (\"PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution\") that suggested AI would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. This would include a $6.6 trillion increase in productivity, as well as $9.1 trillion derived from consumption-side effects. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe sector- and industrywide appeal of AI isn't lost on Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers. Billionaire investors from many of the most-watched investment funds have been strategically moving their capital into and out of certain artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy is that billionaires have been active sellers of the face of the AI movement -- semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- while piling into two other AI stocks.\n\nBillionaire money managers are kicking Nvidia to the curb\n\nFollowing the end of every quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These 13Fs provide investors with detailed snapshots of what the top asset managers have been buying and selling. Based on the latest round of 13F filings, eight prominent billionaires put Nvidia on the chopping block, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nIsrael Englander of Millenium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nNvidia has become what I regularly refer to as the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are a staple of high-compute data centers. Demand has, thus far, handily outpaced supply of Nvidia's chips, leading to off-the-scale pricing power that's sent the company's data center sales through the roof.\n\nBut there's also no shortage of reasons to believe that the best for Nvidia has come and gone. In addition to growing external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia could contend with a significant amount of internal competition for AI chips from its own top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet, collectively account for around 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet all four companies are developing high-powered AI chips of their own.\n\nBillionaires might also be turned off by the regulatory headwinds Nvidia is dealing with. An initial round of export restrictions to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product, prompted Nvidia to develop the toned-down A800 and H800 chips. However, U.S. regulators ultimately restricted the export of these chips to China, as well. China is a key market for Nvidia, and these restrictions threaten to reduce its sales by billions of dollars every quarter.\n\nThe valuation doesn't make much sense, either. Nvidia is nearing the same levels that Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked at during the dot-com bubble, based on trailing-12-month sales. We've simply never seen a market-leading business trade at such a premium to its sales for an extended period of time. It shouldn't be that surprising that billionaires have been selling Nvidia stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Baidu\n\nThe first AI stock that had billionaire money managers completely forgetting about Nvidia during the December-ended quarter is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). Though not all billionaire investors will put their funds' money to work in China stocks, eight billionaires were buyers of Baidu (say that three times fast) during the fourth quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (290,154 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (147,481 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (135,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (80,815 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (47,000 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (38,966 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (5,545 shares)\n\nBaidu's utilization of AI can be seen in two of its fastest-growing segments: cloud and intelligent driving. The company's AI Cloud can allow merchants to use generative AI solutions to tailor ads to individual customers. Meanwhile, Apollo Go is the world's most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service, with accumulated rides on public roads surpassing 5 million since inception. AI-fueled ventures are helping Baidu's non-online marketing segment grow by a double-digit percentage more often than not.\n\nWhat billionaire investors might appreciate with Baidu, in relation to Nvidia, is that its foundational operating segment would likely prevent it from tumbling if the AI bubble bursts. Baidu's internet search segment has accounted for between 60% and 85% of China-based internet search share over the past nine years. Having the clearly dominant search engine in China should afford Baidu strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nBillionaires are likely also attracted to Baidu's minuscule valuation. Even factoring in the regulatory risks of investing in China-based companies, Baidu is valued at just 8 times forward-year earnings and less than 2 times trailing-12-month sales. It's a far cry from the mammoth valuation Wall Street has assigned to Nvidia, and presumably places a safe floor beneath Baidu's stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Amazon\n\nThe other AI stock that had billionaires forgetting about Nvidia is none other than \"Magnificent Seven\" component Amazon. During the December-ended quarter, eight successful billionaire investors piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nAmazon is incorporating AI solutions into its operations in more ways than can be counted here. Some of the more intriguing applications include leaning on generative AI solutions within its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help merchants personalize advertising to consumers, as well as relying on generative AI to improve the quality of product listings for merchants.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its market-leading e-commerce platform, online retail sales contribute very little in the way of operating cash flow or profits since it's a low-margin segment. The lion's share of the cash flow Amazon generates can be traced back to its ancillary operations: AWS, subscription services, and advertising services.\n\nAWS is the critical cog that's powering Amazon's cash flow higher. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of growth, which suggests AWS can sustain its leading share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Despite only accounting for a sixth of Amazon's net sales, AWS was responsible for two-thirds of Amazon's operating income last year.\n\nAmazon is also historically cheap, when compared to Nvidia. Shares are currently valued at less than 13 times consensus cash flow per share for 2025, which represents a 44% discount to Amazon's average multiple to cash flow over the prior five-year period.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Baidu wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "With artificial-intelligence-related semiconductor stocks flying into low-earth orbit, you may be left wondering if there are alternative opportunities in the space. There are – and they enjoy the highest level of endorsement among Wall Street analysts.\n\nWe must start, though, with a word of caution. Thanks to the stratospheric rise of companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the fervor has dramatically lifted all boats. Therefore, many semiconductor stocks will likely require forward-looking price adjustments. Right now, a good chunk of the top players have already exceeded prior average expectations.\n\nStill, with so much interest in the burgeoning ecosystem, you may be enticed to take a risk. If that’s you, here are the strong buy semiconductor stocks to put on your short list.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s second-most valuable semiconductor company, per its public profile. Further, it’s the world’s largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry. Because of its pertinence to the global computer chip supply chain, it commands huge geopolitical implications.\n\nUnsurprisingly, TSM stock has been on a strong run this year, gaining 44% of equity value since the January opener. Per covering analysts, they anticipate revenue this fiscal year to come in at $84.86 billion. If so, that would represent a 22% lift from last year’s print of $69.4 billion.\n\nEven better, they view 2025 revenue hitting $101.38 billion. That would be a massive 19.7% leap from 2024’s projected top line. For 2024 and 2025, earnings per share may reach $5.75 and $7.03, respectively.\n\nLastly, the experts rate TSM shares as a unanimous strong buy. Notably, the highest price target of $185 implies upside potential of more than 26%. Therefore, it’s one of the semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nSpecialized equipment and services firm ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) easily ranks among the top semiconductor stocks to consider if you’re looking for highly endorsed enterprises. It might not be a household name in the traditional sense. However, it’s the leading supplier of photolithography systems, which are essential for the production of integrated circuits (ICs) and microchips.\n\nHere’s the deal with ASML stock: since the start of the year, it’s already enjoyed a robust performance. So, some concerns exist about betting on the entity now. Further, analysts project that by the end of this fiscal year, sales will land at $30.42 billion. That’s less than 1% higher than last year’s print of $30.18 billion.\n\nAt the same time, the experts believe 2025 sales will hit $37.91 billion, which would be a 24.6% leap from 2024’s projected top line. Also, it’s important to emphasize how critical ASML is to the broader semiconductor supply chain.\n\nAnalysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a high-side target of $1,050.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Switzerland, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) is a multinational semiconductor company that designs, manufactures and sells semiconductor products used in various electronic applications. Primarily, the company focuses on microcontrollers or small computing devices used to control various functions in electronic systems. As well, it features relevancies in analog integrated circuits (ICs) or components that process continuous signals (i.e. sound, temperature, etc.) and converting them into digital data.\n\nStated differently, there’s a very high chance that you’re using STMicroelectronics’ various innovations without actively knowing about it. Many of the company’s products are integrated into everyday products and systems: smartphones, automotive systems, home appliances, industrial equipment and more.\n\nAdmittedly, the forward-looking framework is a bit questionable. Analysts project 2024 sales to land at $16.17 billion, which is 6.4% below last year’s tally. However, they also anticipate 2025 sales to reach $17.56 billion by 2025.\n\nOverall, covering experts rate STM a strong buy with a $48.40 price target. The high-side estimate calls for $55 per share. It’s one of the semiconductor stocks to consider for the long haul.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Has 40% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst. Is the Stock a Buy Near Its All-Time High?",
        "content": "There's no denying that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for artificial intelligence (AI). Its chips have become the industry standard for creating and running AI models, which has kicked its stock into overdrive, soaring roughly 500% since the start of 2023.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst believes this is just the beginning. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nProfiting from the AI gold rush\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse boosted his price target to $1,200 while maintaining a buy rating on Nvidia stock. This represents gains of almost 40% compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analyst believes investors are underestimating the company's software business, which has already achieved a $1 billion run rate annually and is \"only in the first inning.\"\n\nThe analyst further suggests generative AI will largely run in data centers, which could be a \"$500 billion business for Nvidia,\" pushing earnings per share (EPS) to $35 next year.\n\nThe road to $1,200\n\nThe analyst could be on to something. Just last month, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the opportunity:\n\nThere's about a trillion dollars' worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we'll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering [AI] software around the world.\n\nThis is contingent on the continued adoption of generative AI, but most market commentators believe it's still early days. Data centers will need to increase their capabilities in order to keep up with the greater computational demands required by AI. Nvidia dominates the data center market with an estimated 95% share. Furthermore, Nvidia is the gold standard for machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with a 95% share of that market.\n\nAll the pieces are in place for Nvidia to maintain its dominance. Furthermore, if Nvidia earns $35 per share next year, a stock price of $1,200 works out to a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 34, so the stock would be a steal at its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Artificial-intelligence bulls are increasingly gravitating toward an ETF that amps up bets on Nvidia Corp. as trading volumes and inflows hit all-time highs.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring Back Stock Rally Stalls in Countdown to Inflation Data: Markets Wrap Tech CEOs Are Addicted to Taking Needless Risks These Are the Best Countries for Wealthy Expats\n\nAfter notching a record $252 million in fresh capital last week, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily exchange-traded fund (ticker NVDL) saw its second-biggest trading volume on Monday as Wall Street’s AI darling extended its Friday retreat.\n\nThe fund, which gives investors two times the daily return of the underlying stock, has grown to $1.4 billion since launching at the end of 2022. NVDA has become a vehicle for investors big and small who are steadfast in their conviction that the Jensen Huang-led firm is riding profound technological shifts in the global economy that will create new wealth-generating opportunities in the stock market.\n\nOn Friday when Nvidia dropped nearly 6%, the fund clocked in record trading volumes, with over $2 billion worth of NVDL exchanging hands. Investors piled a net $102 million into the fund that day, likely betting on a short-term reversal in the semiconductor stock.\n\nTo Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading, “activity in NVDL is a key indicator of retail sentiment and activity,” given the size of the ETF’s trading volume. Meanwhile, short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding in the fund is low at just 1.5%, according to Markit Securities.\n\nThe staying power of Nvidia’s rally will be tested on Tuesday, when a key inflation reading drops.\n\nRead more: ETFs That Aim to Double Tesla’s Famous Volatility Land With SEC\n\nYear-to-date NVDL’s returns stand at 156%.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Can Ride the AI Cloud Boom to New Heights",
        "content": "An article in the Wall Street Journal from July 2023 indicated that the AI Cloud boom has created significant opportunities for multiple firms in their stocks. The thrust of the article was that Cloud providers largely remained incapable of supporting large AI applications. Even the hyper-scale firms that populate Silicon Valley and its equivalents globally were not considered ready.\n\nThe opportunity continues in 2024: Infrastructure wasn’t designed to run the large complex systems required in AI or to handle such complex calculations. In short, there is as big an opportunity today as there was when the Wall Street Journal ran that article nine months ago.\n\nThe majority of the opportunity lies in North America where AI has grown quickest. However, the opportunity is global in scale. Let’s take a look at seven companies that are poised to continue to ride the AI Cloud boom to new heights.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) baba value stocks\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet’s begin with Alibaba, (NYSE:BABA) a stock representing the Chinese firm and a market outside of North America. The Chinese market differs from the American market in material ways. That means AI applications also differ.\n\nFor example, one of the more prominent applications of AI that is positively affecting Alibaba is in relation to e-commerce. Firms throughout China tapped Alibaba’s large language model to substantially increase sales on the November 11 shopping event known as Single’s Day.\n\nAlibaba also cited strong results on Single’s Day in its earnings release from early February. And while those results were positive, Alibaba is also reflective of the broader Chinese economy which continues to face substantial issues. The result is that Alibaba’s revenues are essentially flat. Revenues increased by 5% during the period with Cloud revenues growing similarly at 3%. To be clear, that is not acceptable for the firm and led to substantial decreases in net income.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, that is not the point here. Instead, the point is that Alibaba is among preeminent Cloud providers in China. That positions the company to rebound strongly and is one of the primary reasons that the stock has so much upside at the moment. One reason to believe in that narrative is simply that Alibaba has cut prices on its AI Cloud offering in an effort to spur demand.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) sign reading Google inside building\n\nSource: Benny Marty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) still has a chance to ride the AI Cloud boom higher even though it continues to fumble the opportunity. The stock has dropped dramatically over the past month as the company continues to scramble to catch up.\n\nThere is an ongoing arms race in the AI sector and Alphabet has been behind since day one. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) jumped far ahead of Alphabet in early 2023 when it announced its investment in ChatGPT. It really hasn’t relented since. That has left Google wondering what it can do and taking risks in order to make up ground. The results haven’t been very good frankly. The company is currently facing a firestorm over controversial AI generated images. That is only making its troubles worse.\n\nThe sell-off is an opportunity. January earnings were stronger than expected and rate cuts later this year will propel Tech again into the limelight. Take the bad news as good news for contrarian investors and act.\n\nAlteryx (AYX) The Alteryx (AYX) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlteryx (NYSE:AYX) isn’t a household stock name nor is it among the best known firms in relation to the AI cloud boom.  Instead, it is an analytics automation business with a legitimate chance to further establish itself with enterprise customers.That’s particularly important at the moment as many enterprise customers continue to question the value of their previous investments in the AI cloud.\n\nAlteryx is investing in that opportunity. The company recently announced an expanded partnership with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. Those new integrations are expected to decrease the time for users to generate AI driven enterprise use cases. Such use cases are a major target area for AI cloud development; it will only increase the speed at which data is produced which will further increase the need for analytics with which to draw actionable insight.\n\nThe expanded partnership has the potential to increase revenues at Alteryx which already was performing strongly. During 2023 sales increased by 13% at the company.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has gone from a company that is highly government-oriented to one that is more commercially oriented of late. The company is again leveraging its government connections and relationships, propelling its stock higher.\n\nPalanitr first established a name as an analytics firm with a more conservative bent. It was highly connected to the government and the defense sector in particular. Then the company continued to grow and ultimately reached profitability which helped to catapult its stock much higher. A big part of that was its AI cloud offerings.\n\nIt was suddenly a more commercially oriented firm. That’s where it stood when the company last released earnings in early February. Commercial revenues grew by 70% during the fourth quarter.  They were catching up to government revenues.\n\nGovernment revenues are surging again though, as the company just landed a $178 million contract for the Army’s project Titan. It will leverage Palantir’s AI for its battlefield systems. That could propel Palantir stock higher again and is a reason to believe in its continued strength as the AI Cloud continues to develop.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is essentially a picks and shovels stock in relation to the AI cloud. The company’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven indispensable within the leading cloud companies that provide AI services broadly.\n\nThose GPUs are sold as stand-alone chips and are also sold in combination with a CPU, both of which are used to power the AI cloud. Those chips are known for their parallel processing capability and have been in use for AI for roughly a dozen years.\n\nAgain, it is Nvidia’s GPUs that are far and away in highest demand. That demand is producing incredible sales growth. Nvidia expects $24 billion in revenues in the current quarter. If it reaches that goal it would represent a tripling of sales over the same 12 months prior.\n\nInvestor apprehension is logical given that Nvidia shares traded for roughly $150 in early 2023 and rose to more than $800 by early 2024. Yet, when one considers that revenues are probably going to triple this quarter it is also entirely logical that Nvidia shares are expected to rise as high as $1,400.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) represents Nvidia’s strongest competition. That is the clearest reason to buy the stock as AI cloud applications continue to develop.\n\nWhile Nvidia clearly has the most in demand chips for AI application, their continued dominance isn’t assured. For one, buyers are very clearly seeking alternatives due to high prices for Nvidia chips. Both MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft recently stated that they would switch to AMD’s chips. It is very much worth noting that they buy roughly 60% of all of the chips that Nvidia sold recently.\n\nIt remains clear that AMD will have legitimate opportunities to serve firms like Meta Platforms and Microsoft moving forward. That is a strong catalyst that has propelled AMD shares above $200 recently.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD is also targeting the Chinese market which continues to face strong export restrictions from the United States. There is an opportunity there yet AMD will have to weaken the chips that it intends to sell in the country.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is another stock to consider in connection to both the country and the ongoing AI cloud opportunity.\n\nBaidu is analogous to the Google of China and provides many similar services. In other words, it is deeply connected to all things internet and artificial intelligence within the country.\n\nThe good news is that Baidu has done better than some other large leading Chinese tech firms on a top line basis. In 2023, revenues grew by 9%. Alibaba, for example, as discussed above, saw its revenues increase by a more modest 5% during the same period.\n\nThe company did not provide a strict break out of cloud AI revenues. However, it did mention that much of its growth during the period was attributable to Cloud AI investments. Baidu represents a contrarian investment that leverages the combined power of a Chinese economic rebound and Cloud AI investment. So, as with Alibaba, there is a lot of future potential in the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It focuses on network connectivity and high data speeds, boasting a robust 5G network covered by ultra capacity 5G. This translated into industry-leading growth adding 1.3 million net account additions in 2023.\n\nIn FY23, T-Mobile’s revenue was flat but the company saw significant bottom line and FCF growth. Net income increased 221% YOY to $8.3 billion, with adjusted FCF up 77% to $13.6 billion. Management is forecasting a strong outlook for 2024, guiding net customer additions of more than 5 million and adjusted EBITDA between $31.3 – $31.9 billion. This makes TMUS stock one of the top 5G stocks to buy before it makes new highs in 2024.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSE:FIVG) is not a 5G stock but is one of the perfect ways to gain exposure to 5G stocks. It is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is designed to capture the growth and commercialization of 5G network infrastructure.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF invests in a basket of the top companies across the 5G ecosystem.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 5 Stocks.\n\nOn March 8 Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC said that the latest pullback in AI stocks shows how “fickle” the stock market can be. Cramer said while he is a big “believer” in AI, some stocks in the industry became too hot. While Jim Cramer keeps recommending investors to take some money off the table when stocks run too high, he’s still highly bullish on mega-cap tech stocks and AI plays like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG). For example, last week, Jim Cramer advised a caller during his program to “stick” with Meta Platforms. Cramer said that the latest news around TikTok could become a “tailwind” for the social media company. Cramer yet again praised Mark Zuckerberg. Cramer is also advising investors to keep holding Alphabet despite the notion that it is behind in the AI race. Cramer said that he’s holding onto Alphabet because of what the company “can” do instead of what it’s currently doing. He thinks Alphabet has a lot of “optionality.”\n\nJim Cramer also talked about what he called the “new industrial revolution,” referring to major tech and AI plays. As expected, Cramer yet again highlighted the juggernaut that is Nvidia and said the company’s high performance chips have made it a monopoly in the industry and it would take a long time for other companies to catchup. Cramer said this monopoly was “born” because of “sweat, blood and tears” of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team.\n\nJim Cramer also said that the AI revolution is giving rise to a plethora of new applications and ecosystems which would help many companies in relevant sectors.\n\nJim Cramer advised investors to go in a “wait and see” mode and process the upcoming CPI and PPI reports before reaching to any conclusions about the Fed’s possible path in its battle against inflation.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer Does Not Like These Stocks in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's bearish on. With each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment to see what smart money investors think about these stocks.  Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about New York-based REIT Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL). Cramer said it’s one of those commercial real estate companies where he does not know “what they own.” Cramer said he “never recommend these stocks.” Cramer also claimed that he has been right from “day one” about these stocks that’s why he won’t recommend this one.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 12 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE:GNL).\n\n9. Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer seems extremely disappointed with restaurant chain company Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO). When asked about the stock during his latest program on CNBC, Cramer said he has “lost faith” in Portillos Inc's (NASDAQ:PTLO) management. Cramer said Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) insiders were selling the stock all along. He also thinks Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) is an overvalued company. He said Portillos Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO) needs better earnings.\n\nLast month Portillos Inc's (NASDAQ:PTLO) announced Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.13, beating estimates by $0.07. Revenue in the period jumped 24.5% year over year to $187.9 million, surpassing estimates by $3.68 million.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on PTLO, he's recommending buying NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n8. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nJim Cramer yet again reiterated his thesis on crypto-related stocks when he was recently asked about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Cramer said it’s better to buy Bitcoin if you want exposure to cryptocurrencies. Cramer said buying Bitcoin or the “Ethereum ETF that’s gonna be coming” would be better than buying Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT). Cramer was referring to the spot Ethereum ETF that is expected to be approved by the SEC in the coming days.\n\n7. Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nRoku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. When a Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) investor recently asked Cramer about the stock, Cramer said “you are in a house of pain” and he thinks the “door” won’t open anytime soon if someone is looking to sell the stock without bearing losses.\n\nCramer said he does not want to “be there” on Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) since he believes the “forces of improvement are weighing on” Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). Cramer said the Walmart deal was a “kiss of death” for Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU). He was referring to Walmart’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Vizio which is expected to increase the already hot competition in the streaming industry.\n\n6. Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nWhen asked about Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) in a recent program, Jim Cramer said he would start talking “positively” about robotic process automation stocks if they start making money. But until then, Cramer said, he cannot recommend companies that are not making money. In November last year Cramer had advised investors to not “touch” Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH).\n\nWhile Jim Cramer is bearish on UiPath, he's bullish on other AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nIn February, Scotia Bank started covering Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) stock with a $29 price target. Scotia Bank’s analysts wrote:\n\n\"We believe PATH is set up to make further inroads into automation budgets and continue its industry leadership, but the opportunities come with challenges, namely a dynamic end-market and rising competition. We are intrigued by PATH’s growth durability and margin progression as it scaled to $1.5B in ARR in short order, but wait for a better entry point before recommending shares.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 38 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH). The most notable stakeholder of Uipath Inc (NYSE:PATH) during this period was Cathie Wood, which had a $1 billion stake in the company.\n\nPart of the reason why Cathie Wood likes Uipath is AI. The company talked about its AI offerings and future plans in an earnings call in December 2023: [Read the entire earnings call transcript here]\n\n\"We expect Autopilot, which is based on Generative AI, to bring our unique capabilities in RPA, API automation, Document Understanding, and Specialized AI to the full spectrum of enterprise-grade end-to-end processes automation. Autopilot for Studio is intended to help developers across skill levels build automations faster by leveraging natural language descriptions to generate automation workflows.

Working with Deloitte, they have created a robust automation program across their organization leveraging our AI products like Document Understanding to automate their meter inspection process where they have achieved over $12 million and 163,000 hours in savings to date.\n\nWith c-level sponsorship, during the quarter they expanded their UiPath deployment to incorporate Test Suite into their automation journey with a goal of saving over $70 million a year. And, we are humbled by third-party recognition of our achievements, including IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Intelligent Document Processing or IDP, 2023-2024 Vendor Assessment where UiPath was named a leader in IDP for our broad market leadership and robust IDP capabilities in UiPath Document Understanding and Communications Mining integrated into our broader enterprise automation platform. Innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy and we challenge ourselves every day to deliver market leading capabilities with a customer first mindset. I spent a lot of time with our teams in both Bellevue and Romania this quarter and am energized by our cutting edge product roadmap focused on transforming enterprise automation by harnessing the next-generation of AI technologies.\"\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Does Not Like These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 10 Latest Stock Picks This Week Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "7 Small-Cap Value Stocks to Buy Before the Tech Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "Even as the S&P 500 marks new highs, some investors see small-cap value stocks as today’s best bet for long-term growth. Many are becoming increasingly nervous about index-based stock concentration. For example, S&P 500 investors rely more and more on mega-caps like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as they beat out all other indexed stocks to pull the entire benchmark higher. But the reverse holds true, and a few missteps could bring your entire portfolio to its knees.\n\nOn the contrary, small-cap value stocks offer two key differentiators: they’re sufficiently small and nimble to adapt to changing conditions while offering long-term growth potential, and their value qualities help retain capital. In many cases, that means solid income and dividend opportunities.\n\nThese small-cap value stocks blend the best of those characteristics and stand out as one of the best ways to diversify risk away from a handful of Magnificent 7 stocks controlling your portfolio’s destiny.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nH&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is a unique fintech-esque pick among small-cap value stocks, especially during tax season, but its achievements span the entire calendar year. To mitigate the seasonal nature of the tax business, management introduced Spruce, a mobile banking service that has gained popularity. In its recent earnings report, H&R Block credited $26 million of its quarterly revenue to this financial service, a significant contribution alongside its $99 million in tax preparation sales. Furthermore, HRB is embracing technology to refine the tax filing experience, developing an AI-powered tax assistance tool in partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nHRB offers an impressive total yield of 11.25%, distinguishing itself from other small-cap value stocks. That high yield is supported by a conservative payout ratio of 33.24%, showcasing HRB’s strategy of balancing shareholder rewards with reinvesting earnings into growth opportunities. Tax season is just getting started, and as H&R Block incentivizes filers to sign up for Spruce in exchange for early tax refund deposits, expect post-April earnings reports to reflect the shift in emphasis toward recurring revenue opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmall-Cap Value Stocks: Iridium Communications (IRDM) the Iridium Satellite Communications logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nEveryone’s favorite growth stock guru, Cathie Wood, loves Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM), but this doesn’t diminish its identity as a small-cap value stock. Iridium’s shares have experienced a 30% decline since the beginning of 2024, marking what could be an optimal entry point for investors aiming to include this small-cap value stock in their portfolios.\n\nThe primary cause of its recent decline was the decision to end its joint venture with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in November. The collaboration initially sought to leverage Qualcomm’s expertise in cell-centric semiconductors to develop chips allowing standard cell phones to connect to Iridium’s low-earth orbit satellite array. The termination of this partnership left Iridium looking somewhat sidelined in the rapidly changing space-based telecom sector.\n\nHowever, Iridium is doubling down on efforts to meld its satellite networks with consumer smartphones, a move that could significantly enhance its market value if it proves successful. The company is shifting its strategy to adapt satellite protocols for compatibility with existing mobile devices instead of reengineering cell phones to suit satellite functions. That approach aims to broaden Iridium’s potential market, offering new avenues for growth for this small-cap value stock.\n\nApartment Income REIT Corp. (AIRC) a wooden house shape holds 3 bags of cash representing reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHigher interest rates typically dampen the new mortgage market while pushing rents upward in response to inflation — trends that underscore small-cap value stock Apartment Income REIT Corp’s (NYSE:AIRC) strength in a high-interest-rate climate.\n\nFor the last decade, Apartment Income right-sized its multifamily building portfolio, focusing on premium properties in urban areas with strong demographic growth. That strategic emphasis yields consistently high occupancy rates and regular rent increases. The future demand for AIRC’s properties is likely to be driven by job and income growth, declining rates of homeownership and the continuous draw of city living — all factors exacerbated by rising interest rates.\n\nApartment Income REIT Corp. has meticulously refined its portfolio and operational strategy, reducing its property holdings from 300 in 2008 to 75 today while preserving a strong presence in key markets. That shift reflects savvy management choices, emphasizing quality and operational efficiency in preferred locales rather than mere expansion. AIRC boosted its growth potential by moving away from lower-growth areas, ensuring its resilience against interest rate changes.\n\nWith a 5.6% forward yield, AIRC offers diversification among small-cap value stocks and strength even amid economic uncertainty.\n\nSmall-Cap Value Stocks: Evergy (EVRG) the Evergy logo seen displayed on a smartphone EVRG stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nEvergy (NASDAQ:EVRG) is a small-cap value stock at the unique intersection of utility stock stability and sustainability stock growth potential. Serving customers in Kansas and Missouri, Evergy ranks as the second-largest producer of wind energy in the United States. The company recently increased its quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.6425 per share, offering a forward yield of 5% to investors interested in green energy.\n\nFacing challenges similar to those in the REIT and consumer staples sectors, utilities have been under pressure this year due to price caps and rising energy costs, leading to tighter margins. Since January, the utility sector has seen a nearly 10% decline, with Evergy experiencing a 4% drop, slightly beating sector competitors. Despite this, Evergy’s focus on sustainable energy solutions and dividend growth strategy enhance its attractiveness to income-oriented investors.\n\nEvergy resolved a rate adjustment dispute with Kansas regulators in November, a move likely to help realign the company’s trajectory and reinforce its competitive edge. As utilities often grapple with the high costs associated with debt and expanding wind power capabilities, these sectors face unique challenges. However, should the anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts come to pass, Evergy is well-positioned to make a strong comeback.\n\nPerimeter Solutions (PRM) Fireman standing in front of fire truck.\n\nSource: VAKS-Stock Agency / Shutterstock\n\nPerimeter Solutions (NYSE:PRM) is a small-cap value stock specializing in firefighting equipment, particularly fire suppression and extinguishment chemicals. Demonstrating significant growth since 2010, Perimeter reported a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2% since that year. Management also forecasts its revenue to soar to $100.2 billion by 2027 from $70.8 billion in 2022. Steady demand for firefighting equipment underpins its success, suggesting a robust outlook for the company.\n\nPerimeter’s goal is to offer “private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market,” a target it consistently hits. And, with a price-to-book ratio of only 0.80, PRM seems somewhat undervalued despite recent success. To that end, management also embarked on an aggressive buyback program to boost shareholder value, generating an 11.24% total yield in 2023 and a 6.92% total yield over the preceding 12 months. Due partially to its buyback and partly based on pure expansion opportunity, shares surged almost 40% year-to-date. But it isn’t too late to snag a piece of this small-cap value stock.\n\nSmall-Cap Value Stocks: Aspen Aerogels (ASPN) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (ASPN) logo\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs environmental friendliness and corporate compliance continue to pressure industrial operations, chemical insulation company and small-cap value stock Aspen Aerogels (NYSE:ASPN) stands to benefit. Aspen Aerogels specializes in creating aerogel-based insulation materials designed for the high-temperature conditions of oil refineries and power plants. That specialization establishes Aspen as a key component in sustainability efforts for scaled manufacturing and similar working environments. Despite its critical role, this small-cap value stock tends to be overlooked by retail investors, even though institutional analysts unanimously rate it a Buy.\n\nAspen is not yet profitable, but its fourth-quarter performance proved promising after a significant loss reduction — reporting a mere $0.5 million loss compared to the previous year’s $9.6 million. And, despite posting a negative net income, the company’s revenue increased over four consecutive quarters, culminating in record sales figures most recently. With Aspen Aerogels working to broaden its market reach and improve its profit margins, anticipation for heightened investor interest in 2024 is growing, positioning this small-cap value stock as a standout among sustainable solutions.\n\nHanesbrands (HBI) HanesBrands (HBI) logo displayed on a smartphone with red Hanes underwear brand logo displayed in image background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/viewimage\n\nHanesbrands (NYSE:HBI), a leading seller of innerwear clothing, dominates 60% of the total addressable market across several countries, making it one of the most well-known small-cap value stocks on the market. Its bottom-barrel valuation includes a 0.35x price-to-sales ratio, even as its clothing line remains popular worldwide.\n\nThe company has faced challenges, including supply chain disruptions and weakened consumer confidence, prompting Hanes’ management to streamline operations and refine its strategic focus. Recently, the company began seeking preliminary offers for its Champion clothing line, signaling a strategic shift away from athletic wear to concentrate more on its foundational innerwear products. The initial bidding is rumored to start at $1.4 billion, a move that promises a substantial influx of funds and aligns with Hanes’ objective to sharpen its business focus.\n\nLast year, Barington Capital Group, an activist investment firm, publicly urged Hanes to implement cost reductions, reduce inventory levels and improve profit margins in an open letter. It appears that Hanes may have drawn inspiration from Barington’s recommendations in pursuing the Champion transaction, indicating the beginning of a recovery phase for this small-cap value stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions (directly or indirectly) in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Most Valuable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock by the End of 2024",
        "content": "If you're wondering why the stock market is back at all-time highs, there's one simple explanation: The \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThis is the group of the seven most valuable tech stocks that include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\n\nThese stocks delivered monster returns last year, and many of them are off to strong starts in 2024, capitalizing on the AI boom and the recovery coming out of the 2022 bear market. Today, Microsoft is the most valuable Magnificent Seven stock and the most valuable company in the world. However, I think we could see a passing of the torch this year. The company that is set to take Microsoft's place? AI superstar Nvidia, which is already dominating the AI chip market and the stock market narrative.\n\nHere are a few of the reasons Nvidia is a good bet to be the most valuable company in the world by the end of the year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia's competition still isn't close\n\nIt's no secret that Nvidia has ridden the generative AI boom to record returns. Since the start of 2023, the stock is up by more than 500%, topping a $1 trillion market cap before passing $2 trillion earlier this year.\n\nIts revenue has tripled and its profit is growing even faster, largely because Nvidia sells the vital components to build out the AI models and applications that almost every major corporation sees is betting on. That tech infrastructure relies on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), and there's been extraordinary demand for them as analysts estimate that the company owns a 98% share of the data center GPU market.\n\nIt's true that competition is on the way. AMD launched its MI300 generative AI accelerator in December, but the company's first-quarter guidance indicates that its data center revenue will still be a fraction of Nvidia's.\n\nCompetition entering the market doesn't mean it will make a significant dent in Nvidia's lead as Nvidia has technological and structural advantages over its aspiring rivals. Some industry insiders have predicted as much as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, Matt Wood, a vice president of artificial intelligence products at AmazonWeb Services told The Information, \"There's no meaningful competition\" for Nvidia, and he was skeptical that AMD or anyone else could pose a significant challenge to the AI chip leader.\n\nIf Nvidia can successfully defend its market share against AMD, Intel, and others, the stock should move even higher.\n\n2. Supply will remain constrained\n\nSkeptics believe that Nvidia and other AI stocks are in a bubble, and its bumper profit is temporarily inflated by supply constraints for AI chips. Once that supply crunch is solved, they argue, prices will come down and Nvidia's profit will fall.\n\nHowever, there's no sign that supply imbalance will resolve itself anytime soon.\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the recent earnings call, \"We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply,\" and CEO Jensen Huang elaborated, noting that supply is improving, but added, \"We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply.\"\n\nHuang made another point that's key to understanding the supply demand dynamic in AI chips, saying, \"With all of the new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products.\"\n\nWhile competition may fill in supply for less powerful components, demand for cutting-edge technology is likely to continue to be difficult to meet, and that's where Nvidia excels. It should remain the leader in the product category, GPUs, which it invented 25 years ago and has advanced ever since.\n\n3. Nvidia will penetrate new markets\n\nWhile Nvidia's near-term success will be determined by its data center business, investors shouldn't forget that the company has the ability to move into new markets such as PC chips, which it announced in January, and it's well positioned to capitalize on evolving markets such as autonomous vehicles and the metaverse.\n\nNvidia's technology has a long history of finding new applications, including digital gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and now AI, but it's a mistake to think that it won't penetrate and dominate new markets as it's done with AI.\n\nThe PC chip market presents an attractive opportunity for Nvidia, with tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue available, and Nvidia could turn the tables on AMD and Intel there, taking market share from them in PCs rather than ceding it in AI.\n\n4. Wall Street continues to underestimate Nvidia stock\n\nNvidia has soared past Wall Street's expectations in each of its past four quarters, showing that analysts continue to underestimate the company's growth and demand for its AI components.\n\nCurrently, the average analyst expects Nvidia to generate earnings per share of $24.50, but that number is likely to go up, assuming the company's current momentum continues.\n\nAt that valuation, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 40, making it not much more expensive than Apple or Microsoft, the two companies it's chasing to gain the title of the top Magnificent Seven stock. Microsoft trades at a P/E ratio of 35, based on estimates for its fiscal year that ends in June, and Apple trades at a forward P/E of 26.\n\nAt a market cap of $2.32 trillion, Nvidia's stock price would have to increase 31% to eclipse Microsoft's current level of $3.04 trillion. That kind of gain looks to be within reach for Nvidia, given its dominance of AI chips and the ongoing supply crunch that should support its wide profit margin.\n\nIt's no accident that Nvidia stock has skyrocketed in the AI boom. It holds the key to unlocking the power of generative AI, and that seems unlikely to change. As demand grows for AI and the components that make it work, Nvidia should go even higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 highest paying countries for business analysts. We have also discussed the demand and importance of business analysts. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Business Analysts.\n\nWhy Are Business Analysts Important?\n\nBy 2025, IDC forecasts a high growth in worldwide data, projecting it to reach a mind-boggling 175 zettabytes, with a 61% increase from the current 33 zettabytes. This exponential increase confirms the monumental challenge of managing such colossal volumes, with data dispersed across three key domains: the core, edge, and endpoints.\n\nIDC's \"Data Age 2025\" report, sponsored by Seagate, highlights the transformative impact of this data explosion. Notably, the storage industry is set to ship 42 zettabytes of capacity within the next seven years, while IoT devices are projected to generate 90 zettabytes of data by 2025. With nearly half of this data expected to reside in public cloud environments and around 30% consumed in real-time, the landscape of data management and utilization is undergoing a seismic shift, demanding innovative solutions to navigate this data deluge.\n\nTherefore, in today’s day and age, business analysts are indispensable to modern enterprises as they navigate the ever-expanding sea of data. In 2024, when decision-making heavily relies on data-driven insights, business analysts serve as the linchpin. They translate complex datasets into actionable information, guiding strategic choices that shape the trajectory of organizations. Despite the abundance of data, the challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights efficiently. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven to be a crucial ally, empowering analysts to sift through vast datasets rapidly, identify patterns, and predict future trends.\n\nMoreover, AI democratizes data accessibility, enabling non-analytical stakeholders to comprehend insights effectively. By capitalizing on AI, analysts can focus more on strategic analysis rather than mundane tasks, thus maximizing their potential impact.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, in today's tumultuous retail landscape, the importance of analytics cannot be overstated. Facing challenges like labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and the threat of climate change, retailers are turning to data-driven insights for guidance. These analytics come in various forms, from descriptive and diagnostic to predictive and prescriptive, helping retailers understand consumer behavior, manage inventory efficiently, and empower their associates. For instance, by leveraging cloud-based analytics, retailers can optimize inventory placement across hundreds of stores, enhancing sales and customer satisfaction. Additionally, innovative approaches like using AI-powered robots to monitor inventory levels offer practical solutions to the supply-and-demand puzzle. Owing to the growing importance of business analysts, it is also one of the highest paying jobs for the future.\n\nTop Skills for Business Analysts to Learn in 2024\n\nIn the 2023, State of Social Media report, we discovered some interetesing findings: 80% of businesses expect a social media budget increase within three years, with 44% predicting a rise of over 50%. 90% emphasize the importance of capitalizing on social data for strategic decision-making. Moreover, 97% recognize the role of AI and ML in efficient data analysis. Leaders are gearing up to harness emerging technologies to maximize social media's impact. As social platforms evolve into indispensable business tools, adept utilization of data and AI has become paramount for competitive advantage. From these stats, we infer that it is high time business analysts learn machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to harness data-driven insights, predict trends, and optimize business processes. ML and AI empower analysts to extract valuable patterns from vast datasets, enabling informed decision-making and competitive advantage.\n\nTo read more about skills in demand, see the most In Demand Skills for Freelancers.\n\nHighest Paying Companies for Business Analysts\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are two of the highest paying companies for business analysts in 2024 with average annual salaries of $171,988 and $169.015 respectively, according to Glassdoor.com.\n\nSpeaking on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the company’s ascension to the third most valuable US company has confirmed the growing prominence of artificial intelligence in investment circles.

        "title": "17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 17 European countries with the highest unemployment rates. We have also discussed the fluctuating unemployment rates in the EU zone in 2023. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\n\nIn November 2023, the unemployment rates in Europe continued their downward trend, with the euro area at 6.4% and the EU at 5.9%. These figures represent a decline from the previous month and the same period in 2022. Eurostat data showed a decrease in the number of unemployed persons in both the EU and the euro area compared to October 2023 and November 2022, with 12.954 million individuals unemployed in the EU and 10.970 million in the euro area.\n\nYouth unemployment remained a concern, with 2.814 million young people unemployed in the EU, of which 2.321 million were in the euro area. Although the youth unemployment rate decreased slightly from the previous month, it saw an increase compared to November 2022. Unemployment rates for men and women showed slight variations, with women experiencing a slightly higher unemployment rate in both the EU and the euro area. It is worth noting that Luxembourg and Austria are countries with the low unemployment rates in Europe.\n\nDuring our research, we also observed the intricate dynamics of job creation and unemployment rates in Southern Europe, particularly in Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy. Despite a noticeable decrease in unemployment figures over the past decade, the underlying issues of job insecurity and low wages persist. Portugal, for instance, experienced a remarkable economic turnaround, with its unemployment rate dropping from a peak of 17.9% in 2013 to 6.6% by the end of 2023. Similarly, Greece saw a significant decrease from 27% in 2014 to below 10% presently. Italy recorded the creation of 456,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, contributing to a decreased unemployment rate of 7.2% in December 2023. Spain also witnessed a noteworthy drop in unemployment, despite regional disparities, with the creation of 783,000 jobs in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite these positive trends, challenges such as regional disparities and inadequate training persist as there are disparities in unemployment rates across regions, such as 6.3% in Spain's Basque Country compared to 17.6% in Andalusia. Additionally, a major proportion of the population lacks adequate education, with over 35% of individuals in Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece having an education level below the baccalaureate. Furthermore, job insecurity remains prevalent, compounded by the acceptance of low wages. It is worth highlighting that Malta was the country with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe in 2023.\n\nWhile unemployment rates continue to fluctuate, key employers in Europe like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) are actively participating in the region to improve the economic and technological landscape in these countries.\n\nFor example, in response to the growing demand for cloud infrastructure in Europe, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is making major investments to expand its capabilities. This expansion includes bolstering infrastructure at both new and existing data centres, incorporating cutting-edge AI accelerators from industry leaders like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD, and optimizing networking and storage solutions for enhanced performance. With over 60 datacenter regions worldwide, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) boasts the largest global cloud footprint, ensuring that businesses can access high-capacity networking infrastructure while adhering to data residency and compliance requirements.\n\nEurope's dynamic economic landscape necessitates a robust cloud infrastructure that supports global scalability. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) investments in key European regions such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany underscore its commitment to providing customers with the necessary tools to harness the power of the cloud. These strategic expansions not only cater to burgeoning demand but also align with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)  sustainability goals, incorporating eco-friendly practices like free air cooling and renewable energy sources.\n\nChoosing the right cloud architecture is pivotal for organizations embarking on their digital transformation journey. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure offers a plethora of regions worldwide, allowing customers to optimize costs, meet regulatory requirements, and achieve business growth seamlessly. Leveraging frameworks like the Cloud Adoption Framework and the Well Architected Framework empowers organizations to build reliable, secure, and performant workloads while maximizing the value of their investment in Azure infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is making a bold return to the European market with the launch of its electric Cadillac, the Lyriq SUV. After maintaining a low profile in the region for several years, the automaker has announced that it will start taking orders for the battery electric Lyriq in Switzerland, with deliveries expected to commence in the first half of 2024. Over the next couple of years, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to introduce electric models in Sweden, France, and three additional European countries. This move marks a major shift for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which previously only imported a small number of vehicles into Europe and sold off its Opel and Vauxhall brands in 2017 to what is now Stellantis.\n\nThe Lyriq, powered by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)’s Ultium batteries with an impressive estimated range of 530km per charge, will be priced competitively, starting at CHF82,000 (US$89,705), comparable to premium German electric SUVs. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)  intends to sell its Cadillac EVs directly to European consumers through its websites and flagship stores, including one in downtown Zurich, importing the models from its US plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. With plans to offer a complete range of fully electric models in Europe by the end of the decade, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is set to make a huge impact on the region's electric vehicle market. 17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates\n\nFEMA/ Michael Raphael\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the 17 European countries with the highest rates of unemployment, we utilized the unemployment rates provided by the World Bank, ensuring that the list is based on reliable and objective statistics. The unemployment rates were acquired from World Bank data for the year 2022, for all 17 European countries.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

France\n\nUnemployment Rate: 7.3%\n\nIn France, inflation is on a downward trend while unemployment is steadily rising, echoing concerns about Europe's future.

Similarly, unemployment rose to 7.4% in Q3 2023 from 7.2% in Q2 2023, a concerning development blamed on the sluggish global economy. Analysts predict a gradual increase to 7.8% by 2025.

Authors suggest that while Sweden's labor force grew by an average of 1.1% annually over the past decade, it will decline to 0.3% in the future due to lower demographic growth and shifts in the age composition of the population.\n\nIt is one of the countries where its easy for Americans to find a job.\n\n8. Italy\n\nUnemployment Rate: 8.1%\n\nIn Italy, four out of five individuals from the youth consider emigration due to bleak prospects. Despite a drop in youth unemployment from 42.7% in 2014 to 21% in 2023, reforms like the Jobs Act failed to alleviate their plight. Introduced by Matteo Renzi, the Act relaxed labor market regulations, yet deepened young workers' economic insecurity. Flexible contracts dominate, with 38.2% of youth under temporary arrangements. Italy is one of the EU countries with the highest unemployment rates.\n\n7. Serbia\n\nUnemployment Rate: 8.7%\n\nIn Serbia, unemployment saw a slight increase to 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from 9.0% in the previous quarter. Despite this, there was a marginal decrease compared to the same period in the previous year. The capital Belgrade boasted the lowest unemployment rate at 6.7%, while the southern and eastern regions faced the highest rate at 11.2%.\n\n6. Ukraine\n\nUnemployment Rate: 9.8%\n\nUnemployment in Ukraine has surged to alarming levels, exacerbated by the economic fallout from Russia's invasion. With job losses, reduced incomes, and increasing utility bills, millions of Ukrainians are struggling with financial distress.Economic losses from the invasion have reached staggering figures, prompting 14.5 million Ukrainians to flee the country, while others face dire prospects at home. It is one of the countries with the highest unemployment rate in the world.\n\nClick here to see the 5 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 States with the Highest Unemployment Rates 20 States with the Lowest Unemployment Rates 25 Countries with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in the World\n\nDisclosure: None. 17 European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 11, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Constellation Energy Corp. CEG, Meta Platforms META, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Eli Lilly and Co. LLY.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nS&P 500 at New Highs: 4 Best Stocks YTD\n\nThe S&P 500 soared to new all-time highs on reassuring comments regarding potential interest rate declines. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen 8.3% so far this year.\n\nWe have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double digits so far this year. These are Nvidia Corporation, Constellation Energy Corp., Meta Platforms, Advanced Micro Devices and Eli Lilly and Co..\n\nThe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a U.S. Senate committee that the central bank is \"not far\" from being confident that inflation is declining toward the 2% target, which would make rate cuts possible. The comment has bolstered investor expectations for the first rate cut in June.\n\nPowell noted that inflation had \"eased substantially\" since hitting a 40-year high in 2022 but that policymakers still needed \"greater confidence\" in its continued decline before cutting rates. He added that there are risks of keeping monetary policy tight for too long and damaging an ongoing economic expansion that has sustained a below 4% unemployment rate for two years.\n\nThe latest bouts of weak data have also raised the bets that the Fed might lower interest rates as soon as June. The U.S. manufacturing sector recorded its 16th consecutive month of decline in February, while Michigan University's consumer confidence index dropped slightly last month. U.S. personal spending data also showed the weakest reading in three years. Traders now see a 72.7% chance of the first rate cut this year in June, per CME Group's FedWatch tool (read: Is US Manufacturing Space Improving? 4 Sector ETFs Look Decent).\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the European Central Bank might also start cutting rates as soon as June on a softer outlook for inflation and economic growth.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.\n\nSPY in Focus\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $497.7 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 65 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium-risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).\n\nBelow, we have highlighted the above-mentioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks of SPY\n\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 87% so far this year. It has an estimated growth of 79.2% for the fiscal year ending January 2025.\n\nNvidia makes up 5.1% of the assets in SPY and has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. It has a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nConstellation Energy generates and markets electricity. It sells natural gas, renewable energy and other energy-related products and services. The stock has jumped 53.6% so far this year. It makes up 0.13% of the assets in the SPY portfolio.\n\nConstellation Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.7% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a Momentum Score of A (read: Nasdaq ETF Logs Best Month Since 2015: 5 Top Stocks).\n\nMeta Platforms is the world's largest social media platform. The company's portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app due to acquisitions. The stock has jumped 44.7% and has an estimated earnings growth of 34.1% for this year.\n\nMeta Platforms accounts for 2.6% of SPY's assets. It currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market. It has evolved from a pure-bred consumer-PC chip provider to an enterprise-focus company. The stock has rallied 43.4% so far this year and accounts for 0.79% of the SPY portfolio.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has an estimated earnings growth rate of 30.6% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nEli Lilly is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and boasts a diversified product profile, including a solid lineup of new successful drugs. The stock has gained 33.8% and accounts for a 1.4% share in the SPY portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly has an estimated earnings growth rate of 96.8% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\n\nGet it free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here. 1 Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy With 61% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "2024 is off to a red-hot start. The S&P 500 has soared to record levels as mega-cap tech stocks, in particular, continue to fuel the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative.\n\nThe benchmark had last bottomed around October 2022. Much of the market rebound since, especially in 2023, was influenced by enthusiasm in AI, and this positive sentiment has so far poured over into this year.\n\nIn particular, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), have played a major role in pushing the market higher. Of this exclusive club, Nvidia may be the most important. Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) is off the charts, as generative AI has become the forefront of IT budgets.\n\nDespite a 264% surge in the stock price over the last year, many investors see even brighter days ahead for Nvidia. Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities has a price target of $1,400 for Nvidia stock -- implying about 61% upside from current trading levels.\n\nLet's dig into why Nvidia could be headed even higher and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\n\nNvidia is a money-printing machine\n\nAt the core of Nvidia's record-setting growth are its A100 and H100 GPUs. These GPUs are helping spearhead generative AI applications in machine learning, accelerated computing, and more. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nThe graph above illustrates just how much growth Nvidia is witnessing at the moment. While revenue is increasing over 100% annually, it's the company's margin profile and cash-flow generation that really has me excited.\n\nNvidia's free cash flow grew more than sixfold last year, while gross margin expanded by nearly 16 percentage points. One of the biggest drivers for Nvidia right now is its superior pricing power. The company's semiconductor chips are widely considered to be the best in the industry -- outperforming fierce competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the above analysis paints an encouraging picture, Nvidia is far from just a chip manufacturer. The company has been quietly dropping hints about where it sees further growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSome catalysts to keep an eye on\n\nIn just the last few weeks, investors have gotten a glimpse into how Nvidia is deploying its newfound cash flow. Following a 13F filing in mid-February, investors learned that Nvidia has an investment in voice-recognition software developerSoundHound AI. At the moment, SoundHound AI is a small operation -- only generating about $46 million in revenue in 2023. The more curious aspect of this deal is why Nvidia may be interested in this area of artificial intelligence.\n\nApple has invested heavily in voice-powered assistants, demonstrated by its acquisitions of Siri and Shazam. Moreover, Amazon and Alphabet both leverage similar technology in their Internet-of-Things (IoT) smart home appliances. While the specifics of Nvidia's investment are still subject to speculation, I am intrigued by its interest in voice-recognition software given its cohorts have integrated the technology across many aspects of their respective businesses.\n\nOn top of the SoundHound AI stake, Nvidia also invested in a unicorn start-up called Figure AI. Figure AI is developing a humanoid robot, similar to Tesla's Optimus. Humanoid robots are still in early stages of development, but their ability to disrupt the labor market should not go overlooked.\n\nGoldman Sachs recently referred to humanoid robots as an \"AI accelerant\" and sees an addressable market of $38 billion by 2035. This is more than a sixfold increase in market size potential from Goldman's initial research a year ago. The investment bank's rising forecast credited higher-than-anticipated spend in areas including large language models (LLMs) and capital expenditures (i.e., hardware). These are both areas that Nvidia is not only disrupting, but dominating.\n\nLastly, an area that I believe is very overlooked right now when it comes to Nvidia is software. The company is best known for its chips -- for now. But during the fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Nvidia has a $1 billion run rate enterprise software business. This could end up being an extremely lucrative source of growth in the long run as software growth should help any margin deterioration from the legacy hardware operation as competition in the chip space rises.\n\nA well-deserved premium valuation\n\nNvidia currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 72.7 -- far above its 10-year average of 55.5. Given the staggering rise in the stock price in a short amount of time, this premium shouldn't come as a surprise.\n\nThe bigger question to be thinking about is if Mosesmann's forecast could come true, or if it's a lofty projection outside of reality. My opinion? Nvidia stock is headed higher. Whether it reaches a price target of $1,400, however, is less of a concern to me.\n\nThe company is dominating the market for AI-powered chips. And while I expect competition to rise, I am encouraged and impressed by the company's investments in other growth areas. I think Nvidia is setting itself up to be a full-spectrum solution for AI applications -- from data centers, chips, and software. Despite its premium valuation compared to historical levels, I think now is as good a time as ever to buy shares in Nvidia. The long-term ride looks like it's just getting started.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.\n\nThe impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFurthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment.\n\nIn view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ. 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and ETF performance, head over to 5 Best ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nIn 2023, US-listed ETF trading declined by 17% to $38 trillion due to record-high interest rates, with money market fund assets reaching an all-time high of $5.9 trillion. However, it was still the second-highest year for ETF volumes on record. iShares ETFs, led by iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE Arca: IWM), iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: HYG), and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ GM: TLT), represented $9.4 trillion of this activity. US equity markets traded nearly $127 trillion, making the US ETFs account for 30% of the total American composite volume in the secondary market in 2023. Meanwhile, US-listed Fixed Income ETFs had their second-largest year on record at $5.8 trillion, slightly behind the 2022 figures. Also, options trading in the US-listed ETFs reached record levels in 2023, with the industry totaling $130 trillion, up 24% year-over-year.\n\nThe ETF industry set a new record with 543 new ETFs launched in 2023, surpassing the previous record of just under 480 in 2021 by more than 60 funds. Approximately 75% of the newly launched funds in 2023 were actively managed. According to VettaFi’s Dave Nadig:\n\n“It was only a few years ago when we crossed 2,000 ETFs listed that the first ‘there are too many ETFs!’ complaints started up, and yet here we are. But the reality is there’s no cap on innovation. The products we’ve seen gain traction this year — the rise of active products, the narrow slices of the  market, options overlays, buffers, conversions — they weren’t really even a pipe dream five years ago, and they’re the stories of the year. ETFs have gained so much ground because they solve real problems for real investors.”\n\nLately, retail traders are increasingly utilizing exchange traded funds as a new tool during the recent Bitcoin rally. Newly launched funds, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ GM: IBIT), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (CBOE US: FBTC), and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (CBOE US: ARKB) have experienced a surge in trading volume. For instance, IBIT traded about 96 million shares on February 28, more than double its previous record, indicating significant retail interest. The Fidelity and ARK funds also saw substantial increases in shares traded, surpassing earlier records. The active market suggests that retail traders are leveraging these ETFs to participate in the Bitcoin rally, with the cryptocurrency crossing $60,000 for the first time since November 2021. Despite Bitcoin's 30% rise since the ETFs were approved, their prices have consistently increased over the past six weeks, contributing to the notable trading volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the best ETFs expose investors to stocks like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of March 9, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019.

The company has a dominant position in hard-to-replicate precision-manufacturing technologies and an enviable track record of execution. The majority of Fabrinet’s sales are to optical communications equipment manufacturers, but it has been successfully diversifying into the data center, industrial, auto, and medical end-markets. FN’s stock jumped after reporting June 2023 earnings – data center sales increased 50% sequentially and more than 100% over the previous year, driven by their 800-gigabyte transceivers for Artificial Intelligence applications. The company also announced that Nvidia is a 10%+ customer.\n\nFabrinet was, notably, a top-five holding in the Fund before its June earnings announcement and, although we have trimmed our position, was our largest holding at the end of 2023. While we continue to evaluate what we believe is a positive incremental change in the company’s earnings power, we are seeking to take some profits in keeping with our risk management policies.”\n\n13.

The share price continued its strong performance throughout the spring and summer, and we ultimately sold the position in the third quarter when we no longer saw a margin of safety for the business. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner who created significant value for shareholders by reducing leverage, cutting costs, streamlining operations, improving company culture and simplifying the structure with plans to split the company into three businesses. We hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again in the future.”\n\n9.

Given the large amount of revenue associated with drugs going off-patent, the new product portfolio was key to the company’s ability to change investor perception. Certain launches are not performing as expected, and others are taking longer to scale. Additionally, Bristol-Myers reduced medium-term operating margin guidance to invest in its commercial drugs and the research and development (R&D) pipeline. We do not believe that the company exhibited the level of defensiveness in the strategy we expected given the low valuation.”\n\n8.

During the quarter, the company reported strong fiscal first quarter results, where revenues and earnings beat analyst estimates, driven in large part to growing Al demand. Regarding Intelligent Cloud segment, management noted Azure optimizations were similar to the previous quarter, but new Al and traditional workloads are helping drive greater consumption growth, which resulted in their first reacceleration since March 2022. We believe the strong Azure performance suggests diminishing cost optimization headwinds and growing strength in Al service consumption.”\n\n7.

We have yet to see the long-awaited re-acceleration in AWS (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth. However, in our estimation, the segment’s growth has likely bottomed, and we could see accelerating growth in 2024. Further, Amazon’s e-commerce business has gradually re-accelerated from 2022’s levels and, perhaps most importantly, the company’s margins and free cash flow have rebounded materially from last year. This rebound in margins and free cash flow at Amazon has been a key component of our long-term thesis for the business, and we expect the improvement in these metrics to continue into 2024 and beyond (though perhaps not linearly) as the company continues to optimize costs and capital expenditures. Our position in Amazon reflects our positive long-term expectations of the business, and it is currently our largest absolute weight in the Portfolio.”\n\n6. iShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE Arca: OEF)\n\n5-year Share Price Performance as of March 9, 2024: 92.94%\n\niShares S&P 100 ETF (NYSE Arca: OEF) aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 100 Index, which consists of 100 large-cap US equities.

AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best ETFs To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Biggest Smartwatch Companies in the World Top 12 Companies for Architects in United States Wall Street Picked These 13 AI Stocks for 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Best ETFs To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Which Megacap Stock Has the Greatest GAAP Net Worth? Hint: It's Not Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia.",
        "content": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, what's the biggest company of all? That might seem like an easy question to answer. Just use a stock screen that sorts by descending market cap.\n\nFor much of the past few years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) claimed the biggest market cap of all publicly traded companies. Thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) took over the No. 1 spot earlier in 2024. This AI boost has also put Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) within striking distance of the top position.\n\nBut the real answer to the question depends on how you define \"biggest.\" Warren Buffett recently discussed the biggest company based on net worth as measured by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). And it isn't Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia.\n\nWhat is GAAP net worth?\n\nGAAP net worth is better known by another name -- book value. It's also sometimes referred to as shareholder's equity.\n\nThe calculation of GAAP net worth is straightforward:\n\nDetermine a company's total assets (found on its balance sheet) Determine the company's total liabilities (also on the balance sheet) Subtract total liabilities from total assets to get the GAAP net worth\n\nThere's also an even simpler way to find a company's GAAP net worth. Just look at the value for total stockholders' (or shareholders') equity on the balance sheet.\n\nMicrosoft's market cap tops $3 trillion. The tech giant's GAAP net worth, though, is a much lower $238.3 billion.\n\nIt's a similar story for Apple. The iPhone maker has a market cap of more than $2.6 trillion. But Apple's GAAP net worth is only $74.1 billion.\n\nThe difference is even more pronounced for Nvidia. Although the chipmaker's market cap has skyrocketed to over $2.3 trillion, its GAAP net worth is a little under $43 billion.\n\nThe biggest by far\n\nSo if the largest company based on GAAP net worth isn't Microsoft, Apple, or Nvidia, which company holds the No. 1 spot? Since I mentioned Buffett earlier, you can probably guess who the U.S. winner is. It's his own Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's GAAP net worth stood at nearly $561.3 billion. The conglomerate is more than twice the size of Microsoft based on the metric. It's nearly 7.6 times bigger than Apple and over 13 times larger than Nvidia.\n\nBerkshire boasts the largest GAAP net worth by far of any U.S. business in history, according to Buffett in his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders. He noted that the total GAAP net worth for the S&P 500 excluding Berkshire was $8.9 trillion in 2022. While the total hasn't been calculated yet for 2023, Buffett doesn't think that it will be much higher than $9.5 trillion. He pointed out that Berkshire by itself makes up roughly 6% of the total GAAP net worth of the entire S&P 500.\n\nBut while Berkshire has the biggest GAAP net worth among U.S. companies, there's a company outside the U.S. that's even bigger. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the GAAP net worth for giant oil and gas producer Saudi Aramco totaled $1.75 trillion.\n\nA better metric than market cap or GAAP net worth\n\nWhy don't Berkshire Hathaway and Saudi Aramco get more props for being the biggest companies based on GAAP net worth? There are some drawbacks to using the financial metric. For example, asset values can sometimes be understated or overstated. Intangible assets are especially tricky to accurately value.\n\nMarket cap still matters. However, there's perhaps an even better measurement for determining the biggest companies -- enterprise value (EV). This metric adds a company's market cap and its total debt then subtracts cash and equivalents.\n\nWhat's the biggest megacap company based on EV? Microsoft comes out on top, just as it does based on market cap.\n\nFor investors, though, how much a company can grow is more important than how big it is now. There are plenty of stocks that are likely to grow faster than Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, or Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nWall Street's most bizarre reaction to the relatively benign U.S. employment report on Friday was a late selloff in stellar Nvidia - the artificial intelligence poster child that's almost doubled in price again this year.\n\nAlthough many dismissed Nvidia's late 5% recoil as merely overdue profit taking on its latest near-90% surge so far this year, the stock fell another 1.5% overnight before recovering that ahead of Monday's bell. And the move stopped Nvidia overtaking Apple as the second most valuable company.\n\nAnd there's an inevitable search for some smoking gun. Chipmakers Broadcom and Marvell Technology also fell on Friday after their quarterly reports failed to impress investors.\n\nHardly a game changer in itself, but Nvidia has been sued by three authors who said it used their copyrighted books without permission to train its NeMo AI platform.\n\nAnd in another tech sideswipe on Monday, the European Union's privacy watchdog said the European Commission's use of Microsoft software breached EU privacy rules and the bloc's executive also failed to implement adequate safeguards for personal data transferred to non-EU countries.\n\nEither way, the pullback does come after a wobbly week for the leading \"Magnificent Seven\" of megacaps - perhaps indicating some feeling that they'd all come a little too far too fast. After hitting record highs earlier in the session, the S&P500 ended down 0.6% on Friday and futures were in the red again early Monday.\n\nThe hiccup was hardly a reflection of the February employment report - which was another statement on the rude health of the U.S. economy. New payrolls beat forecasts last month, but the overall labor market cooled with a rise in the jobless rate and ebbing of wage growth.\n\nThat nailed in June for a first interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and saw full-year easing expectations climb to 95 basis points and two-year Treasury yields drop to the lowest in a month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd that all sets up Tuesday's consumer price report for February as the next key moment in the Fed's assessment of the disinflation path.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Wall Street's most bizarre reaction to the relatively benign U.S. employment report on Friday was a late selloff in stellar Nvidia - the artificial intelligence poster child that's almost doubled in price again this year.\n\nAlthough many dismissed Nvidia's late 5% recoil as merely overdue profit taking on its latest near-90% surge so far this year, the stock fell another 1.5% overnight before recovering that ahead of Monday's bell. And the move stopped Nvidia overtaking Apple as the second most valuable company.\n\nAnd there's an inevitable search for some smoking gun. Chipmakers Broadcom and Marvell Technology also fell on Friday after their quarterly reports failed to impress investors.\n\nHardly a game changer in itself, but Nvidia has been sued by three authors who said it used their copyrighted books without permission to train its NeMo AI platform.\n\nAnd in another tech sideswipe on Monday, the European Union's privacy watchdog said the European Commission's use of Microsoft software breached EU privacy rules and the bloc's executive also failed to implement adequate safeguards for personal data transferred to non-EU countries.\n\nEither way, the pullback does come after a wobbly week for the leading \"Magnificent Seven\" of megacaps - perhaps indicating some feeling that they'd all come a little too far too fast. After hitting record highs earlier in the session, the S&P500 ended down 0.6% on Friday and futures were in the red again early Monday.\n\nThe hiccup was hardly a reflection of the February employment report - which was another statement on the rude health of the U.S. economy. New payrolls beat forecasts last month, but the overall labor market cooled with a rise in the jobless rate and ebbing of wage growth.\n\nThat nailed in June for a first interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and saw full-year easing expectations climb to 95 basis points and two-year Treasury yields drop to the lowest in a month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd that all sets up Tuesday's consumer price report for February as the next key moment in the Fed's assessment of the disinflation path. Headline annual CPI inflation is expected to remain steady at 3.1% - with the \"core\" rate ebbing to 3.7% from 3.9% the prior month.\n\nBy contrast overseas, China's jarring bout of deflation appears to have eased somewhat as weekend data showed annual CPI inflation there for the first time in six months - exceeding forecasts with a 0.7% advance. And yet downward price pressures persisted with a deeper 2.7% annual slump in producer prices.\n\nHow much the Lunar New Year holiday affected the readouts remains to be seen, but China's stock benchmarks advanced 1.2% on Monday nonetheless amid some relief.\n\nChina has also asked banks to enhance financing support for state-backed China Vanke and called on creditors to consider private debt maturity extension, in a rare intervention from central government to help an embattled property firm.\n\nIn Japan, speculation about a Bank of Japan policy tightening as soon as this month has intensified over the past week and fourth-quarter GDP revisions on Monday saw initial indications of late 2023 recession magiced away.\n\nAlthough below the latest forecasts, Japan's revised gross domestic product expanded at an annualised clip of 0.4% in the October-December period, better than the initial estimate for a 0.4% contraction.\n\nBut with the yen pushing one-month highs again on Monday amid the BOJ concerns, Japan's Nikkei skidded 2% lower - with chip-equipment maker Tokyo Electron losing 3% and chip-testing equipment maker Advantest off almost 5%.\n\nElsewhere, the dollar was a touch lower.\n\nBut bitcoin hit another record high above $71,000, as the surge in the token showed no signs of slowing down.

        "title": "Stock Split Watch: 2 Unstoppable \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Could Split Their Shares in 2024",
        "content": "Thanks to the advent of low-cost and no-cost trading and the ability to purchase fractional shares at a growing number of brokerages, investing is no longer limited to people with large amounts of available cash. And yet, the idea of buying stocks trading at high per-share prices still makes some investors hesitate when considering a buy. That's probably part of the reason stock splits have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.\n\nAnother reason stock splits are more popular is the onset of a new bull market, which has sent many stocks soaring to new heights and led to double- or triple-digit percentage gains over the past year or so. Some of these top performers are members of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's how the group has fared since the beginning of 2023:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 534% Meta Platforms: Up 326% Amazon: Up 110% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): Up 70% Alphabet: Up 52% Tesla: Up 45% Apple: Up 30%\n\nTo be clear, a stock split doesn't have any effect on a company's underlying value, but it does make the stock more attractive to everyday investors. Here are two Magnificent Seven stocks that have surged in price and could announce stock splits in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia: Current price ~$927\n\nNvidia originally made a name for itself by pioneering the graphics processing units (GPUs) that create lifelike images in video games. In recent years, however, Nvidia's processors have lent their computational horsepower to a number of other use cases, including data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). In each case, Nvidia's processors have quickly become the gold standard, outshining rivals.\n\nExamples abound. Nvidia controls roughly 95% of the market for GPUs used in data centers, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino. It also dominates the market for machine learning -- another branch of AI -- with 95% of that market, according to New Street Research. Nvidia is well positioned to dominate a newer branch -- the nascent generative AI market -- as much of the processing for this segment will be done in the cloud and in data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia generated record revenue that surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion, driving adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 486% to $5.16. This marked the third consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth, and there could be more to come. For the current quarter, management forecasts record revenue of $24 billion, up 234% year over year.\n\nWhile Nvidia has generated enviable growth since the beginning of 2023, stepping back a bit shows that isn't unusual. Over the past decade, Nvidia's revenue has soared 1,900%, driving net income up 8,870%. This growth has fueled the company's surging stock price, which is up more than 19,950%, with a price of $927 as of Thursday's market close. Despite that performance, Nvidia still trades for a reasonable price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nNvidia announced its most recent stock split in May of 2021 when the stock price was roughly $600 per share -- a fraction of what it trades for now. The stock closed Thursday at a new all-time high. Based on its history, it likely won't be long before Nvidia announces another stock split.\n\n2. Microsoft: Current price ~$409\n\nMicrosoft is best known for its ubiquitous Windows PC operating system and Office suite of productivity tools. However, it's the company's latest foray into generative AI that will likely drive growth in the years to come. The poster child for Microsoft's latest efforts is Copilot, a suite of AI-powered digital assistants designed to streamline mundane and time-consuming tasks and promise to spark a wave of increased productivity.\n\nAI is having a halo effect on Microsoft Azure, the company's cloud infrastructure service. In the calendar fourth quarter, Azure's growth of 30% outpaced both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud, which grew 13% and 26%, respectively. This marked the second consecutive quarter of Azure's outperformance. Furthermore, the company noted that six percentage points of its cloud growth was spurred by demand for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Microsoft's revenue grew 18% year over year while EPS climbed 33%. However, since Copilot wasn't available for general release until November, the company doesn't even have a full quarter of AI growth baked in -- and that growth is likely just getting started.\n\nMicrosoft also has a long track record of impressive growth, but it's the company's foray into AI that helped drive the stock price up 70% since the beginning of 2023. Yet stepping back reveals even more compelling results. Over the past 10 years, revenue has grown 204%, driving net income up 286% -- not bad for the world's largest company by market cap. This has driven Microsoft's stock price higher, up nearly 897%, with a price of roughly $409 as of Thursday's market close. The stock is selling for roughly 35 times forward earnings, a slight premium to the broader market, but given its track record, it's earned that premium.\n\nTo be clear, Microsoft hasn't had a stock split since 2003, and back then, the stock was trading for roughly $48 (pre-split). However, given the growth drivers ahead and the fact that Microsoft stock is trading just shy of a new all-time high, this may be the year Microsoft breaks with 20 years of tradition and splits its shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Appear Poised to Become Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "Since this year began, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth stock-fueled Nasdaq Composite have powered to record-closing highs. While there have been patches of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have done the bulk of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent some of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap (as of the closing bell on March 5, 2024), the Magnificent Seven are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are industry-leading businesses with impressive moats\n\nWhat makes the Magnificent Seven so special is their sustained competitive advantages.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure is the world's rapidly growing No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services, while Windows remains the global leader among desktop operating systems. Apple has been a pioneer in smartphone innovation for more than a decade, and offers a share repurchase program that no other publicly traded company can match. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate in AI-accelerated data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global No. 1 cloud infrastructure service platform. Alphabet's Google had a monopoly like 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Alphabet also owns the world's second most-visited social site (YouTube), as well as the third-largest cloud infrastructure service (Google) behind AWS and Azure. Meta Platforms is the company behind Facebook, the most-visited social site globally. Including other popular social-media destinations (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads), Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's currently profitable on a recurring basis. Tesla produced close to 1.85 million EVs last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also known for conducting stock splits -- Meta is the only Magnificent Seven component to have never split its shares.\n\nForget Nvidia: Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are likeliest to split first\n\nA \"stock split\" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a public company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact to its market cap or operating performance. The Magnificent Seven are known for conducting forward-stock splits, which are designed to make shares more affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, quite a few of the Magnificent Seven have completed a forward-stock split, including:\n\nNvidia: 4-for-1 stock split. Amazon: 20-for-1 stock split. Alphabet: 20-for-1 stock split. Tesla: 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nGiven that a single Nvidia share is setting investors back by almost $860, as of the closing bell on March 5, you'd probably think it's a slam-dunk to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock. However, Nvidia is set to face an ever-growing mountain of headwinds this year, and there's a real possibility the company's stock is an epic bubble. In other words, a split may not be in the cards anytime soon.\n\nFor example, even though Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are dominating in high-compute data centers for the moment, competition is picking up in a big way. Advanced Micro Devices has begun its ramped rollout of the MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel anticipates launching its Gaudi3 AI chip later this year.\n\nWhat's far more concerning is that four Magnificent Seven members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet they're all developing their own high-powered AI chips. It's plainly evident that Nvidia's top customers are looking to lessen their reliance on GPUs from the current kingpin of AI.\n\nAdd in regulatory export concerns to China, a lack of insider buying, and the possibility of cannibalizing its own margins as its ramps A100 and H100 production, and there's potential for significant downside in Nvidia stock.\n\nInstead of Nvidia becoming Wall Street's next stock-split stock, two other Magnificent Seven components appear poised to beat it to the punch. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven member I'd expect to split its stock before Nvidia is social media titan Meta Platforms. Shares of the company topped $500 for the first time ever on March 1.\n\nAlthough Meta has artificial intelligence tie-ins -- e.g., it's using generative AI solutions to help advertisers tailor their messages to individual users -- it wouldn't be susceptible to a bubble-bursting event if demand for AI infrastructure didn't meet investors' lofty expectations. This makes it more likely that Meta can sustain, if not build on, its nearly $500 share price.\n\nThe company's social media \"real estate\" is what makes it tick. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded social apps worldwide. Businesses are aware that no social media company offers a greater reach than what Meta can bring to the table. As a result, Meta's ad-pricing power is exceptional in most economic climates.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Meta is sitting on an ever-growing treasure chest of cash. It closed out last year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities in 2023.\n\nWhat all this cash does is allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take chances. Despite hefty operating losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, Zuckerberg is attempting to position Meta to be an on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of this decade. Few other companies have the luxury of taking chances the way Meta can.\n\nAnd unlike Nvidia, Meta remains historically inexpensive, even after its significant run-up from its 2022 bear market lows. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times estimated cash flow in 2025, which represents a substantial discount to Meta's multiple to its cash flow over the trailing decade.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven constituent that appears poised to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock before Nvidia is none other than tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft has split its shares nine times since going public, but last did so in February 2003. A single share of Microsoft is currently tipping the scales at north of $400.\n\nMicrosoft didn't reach a $3 trillion valuation and become the largest publicly traded by accident. It's achieved this distinction by seamlessly blending its legacy cash-cow segments with its fast-paced growth initiatives.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, Microsoft's legacy operations are still exceptionally profitable. Even though Windows has lost desktop operating system (OS) share over the past decade, it remains the undisputed OS leader in personal computing. The cash flow Microsoft generates from the likes of Windows and Office allows it to reinvest in high-growth initiatives and/or make acquisitions.\n\nIn terms of \"high-growth initiatives,\" cloud services and AI take the cake. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for Azure catapulted 28% higher during the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative early innings, which suggests Azure can continue to capture global cloud infrastructure service spend share, as well as sustain a double-digit growth rate with ease.\n\nMicrosoft's AI ambitions are also on display. It's invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, incorporated AI solutions into search engine Bing, and plans to lean on various generative AI solutions to assist businesses with document processing and conversational AI on the Azure platform.\n\nLastly, Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies that sports the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, Microsoft's legacy operations and cloud services wouldn't miss a beat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The stock market has sold off a little recently, but it has still been an overall excellent start to the year, with the S&P 500 up 7% as of market close March 6. However, some major stocks are under pressure.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- collectively make up 29% of the S&P 500. The performance of these companies has ripple effects throughout the broader market.\n\nAlphabet, now down 6% year to date, just joined Apple and Tesla in falling below its 200-day moving average. Here's why I'm watching that metric. It's not a buy or sell signal, but it's interesting.\n\nWatching where a stock has been\n\nThe 200-day moving average shows the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 trading days. Traders track moving averages to gauge a stock's momentum.\n\nFor example, a so-called golden cross is when the 50-day moving average passes the 200-day moving average, a sign that investors are getting bullish on a stock. Interestingly enough, the current price of four Magnificent Seven stocks is above the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average -- which is a very bullish sign. NVDA Chart\n\nThe 200-day moving average is often seen as a critical level of support. If a stock's price falls below the average, it is a bearish sign that investors have turned negative on the stock. GOOGL Chart\n\nNotice that the 200-day moving average can be quite different from the midpoint between the 52-week high and the 52-week low.\n\nIn the case of Apple, its 200-day moving average is only 8% below the 52-week high but nearly 25% above the 52-week low. That usually means the 52-week low was short-lived, or the stock has hovered around the 52-week high for a while.\n\nUnderstanding market sentiment\n\nA great divide has formed in the Magnificent Seven between stocks that are in favor and those that are out of favor. Knowing how the market feels about a stock can help you brace for volatility, but it doesn't necessarily mean a stock is worth buying or selling.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market gets things wrong all the time. One of the best recent examples is Meta Platforms. Since the end of 2022, Meta Platforms is up over 310%. In 2022, it lost over 64% of its value.\n\nIf you were following moving averages alone, you may have been selling Meta Platforms in 2022 and would have missed out on the epic rally since then. If you simply held the stock, you would have done quite well.\n\nAnother recent example is Target(NYSE: TGT). On Nov. 9, 2020, Target collapsed to a three-year low. Since then, it is up a staggering 62.5% in just four months -- a monster move for a stodgy dividend-paying stock.\n\nIn sum, moving averages indicate market trends and can lead to accelerated buying and selling.\n\nUsing moving averages to your advantage\n\nThe best way to use moving averages is to understand how the market is reacting to something and see if you agree or not. For example, if you think that Alphabet has some challenges, but they don't warrant the stock falling below the price that is its 200-day moving average, you could use it as a buying opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, if you believe Nvidia is doing very well, but not so well that the stock's price should be 80% higher than the price of its 200-day moving average, then you may want to hold off buying the stock.\n\nIn other words, you can use the price of a stock relative to the 200-day moving average to see if the market agrees with you or not. If it doesn't agree and a stock is oversold, it could be a great buying opportunity. If it does agree, then the positives may already be priced in and the risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\nSome of the greatest wealth-generating moments are when the market turns negative on a stock even though the investment thesis hasn't changed. There may be some challenges, but oftentimes the sell-off is overblown.\n\nIt happened in 2022 with many tech companies. Before that, there was the pandemic-induced plunge. There was also the notable 2018 U.S.-China trade war sell-off.\n\nThe point is that sell-offs happen all the time, and they sometimes go too far. Right now, there may be some stocks that have run up too far too fast, while others are facing a wave of criticism that may be overblown.\n\nWhat the Alphabet sell-off tells us\n\nThe biggest takeaway from the price action of the Magnificent Seven stocks is that the market can keep going up even if important, heavily weighted stocks are selling off.\n\nApple used to be the most valuable company in the world and a clear market leader. Alphabet was once the third-most-valuable company. Tesla was once worth over $1 trillion, and was the single best-performing stock in 2020. And yet all three stocks are now moving in the opposite direction of the market.\n\nThe market is rewarding companies that are growing, have strong earnings, and/or have a clear runway toward monetizing artificial intelligence (AI). It is also punishing companies that should be leading AI but have lagged behind the competition (like Alphabet).\n\nThe market as a whole can offset the losses from Apple, Alphabet, and Tesla largely because other sectors are doing well, too. Industrials, financials, and consumer staples are examples of sectors outside of big tech that are all making new 52-week highs.\n\nAlphabet breaking below its 200-day moving average is a sign that there could be further selling pressure. But if you believe the investment thesis hasn't changed, then you may want to ignore this signal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "It would take time to find a stock that has skyrocketed as much as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has recently. Thanks to heightened interest (or more like a craze) in companies at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI), this stock has soared 271% in the last 12 months and a whopping 2,170% just in the past five years.\n\nFor those who have watched from the sidelines, it's understandable if you think it's too late to get in on the action. After all, Nvidia is currently a $2.2 trillion enterprise.\n\nBut don't be discouraged. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), an innovative business at the leading edge of the internet for more than two decades, might just be the best AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nA meteoric rise to the top\n\nNvidia sells chips that power data centers which support AI functions, and it counts some big tech corporations as its customers. It's OK if the latest financials have you picking up your jaw from the floor. Nvidia reported revenue growth of 126% in 2023. Even more impressive, operating income surged 686%.\n\nThis company is looking at a truly massive opportunity. On a global basis, the AI market is forecast to rise 800% by the end of the decade. Based on its financial results thus far, it's hard to deny that Nvidia is in a powerful position to benefit from this tech trend.\n\nNvidia's monster rise in the last few years has now made it the world's third-most valuable business. And the shares, unsurprisingly, look expensive. They trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74. That's a lofty valuation, even when you factor in Nvidia's growth prospects.\n\nWhile it might be tempting to want to ride this momentum to strong portfolio returns, the enthusiasm surrounding the company these days might leave zero margin of safety for prospective investors. There's another compelling opportunity to take advantage of today.\n\nDon't forget about Alphabet\n\nNvidia deserves credit, that's for sure. But don't sleep on Alphabet. The FAANG stock has dropped 14% since hitting a new all-time high in late January. This means investors can scoop up shares at a compelling P/E multiple of about 23. That seems like a no-brainer decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's best not to forget that this business is one of the early pioneers of AI, introducing the technology in Google Search in 2001. Back then, AI helped users improve their spelling when making search queries.\n\nAlphabet's progress has been notable. In late 2016, CEO Sundar Pichai proclaimed that the company would be \"AI-first.\" This was six years before the famous launch of ChatGPT, which started the AI craze currently underway.\n\n\"In the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available -- be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go -- and interacting with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural and intuitive, and above all, more intelligent,\" Pichai wrote in a blog post more than seven years ago.\n\nThe fact that consumers probably don't realize that Alphabet has already integrated AI into its various products and services is indicative of how the business has seamlessly executed its strategy. Whether it's Gmail, Photos, Maps, or YouTube, AI permeates through.\n\nAnd when it comes to Google Cloud, which is a back-end infrastructure provider to enterprise and government clients, Alphabet has ample opportunity to move the needle forward with AI. There are already numerous features available to customers, be it generative AI, machine learning, language, or other areas.\n\nIn the last 24 months, Alphabet generated $203 billion of operating cash flow. And as of Dec. 31, the company had nearly $100 billion of net cash on the books. This puts Alphabet in a league of its own when it comes to having the financial resources to continue investing aggressively in AI capabilities. It will be hard for others to keep up.\n\nNvidia is getting all the attention these days. But investors need to consider Alphabet as a smart buying opportunity right now. It's in a favorable position to benefit over the long term from the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "You're a very happy investor if you've owned Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) over the past year. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock is up 530%, while Supermicro's has risen an astounding 1,300%.\n\nIn other words, if you invested $10,000 in each company on Jan. 1, 2023, you'd have nearly $205,000. But after that kind of performance, many investors may wonder if they can still invest in these two AI leaders without the risk of losing serious capital in just a few months.\n\nSo, are either of these two stocks a buy right now? And if so, which is the better purchase?\n\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer are not competitors\n\nNvidia makes best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) that are perfect for training AI models. GPUs can process intense calculations efficiently, making them the best tool for the job. When a client wants to build a supercomputer capable of training AI models, it doesn't order a handful of GPUs; it orders thousands. With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, costing an estimated $30,000 a piece, that's a massive growth driver for Nvidia.\n\nHowever, you can't just connect these GPUs together with a few cables and call it a day. You need a specialized server that properly networks these devices and combines them in clusters to maximize efficiency. That's where Super Micro Computer comes in.\n\nWhile some tech giants may have this expertise in-house, many do not, so they contract Supermicro to build their servers. Supermicro has many different server designs based on the application and expected workload size, so customers of all varieties can find what they need.\n\nThis highlights the first difference between these two investments: Nvidia is a company that nearly all AI-focused businesses work with, while only some work with Supermicro. This doesn't mean Supermicro is doomed to fail, but it is a risk factor investors should consider. Supermicro could be dethroned by a competitor undercutting pricing, while Nvidia might only be knocked off its pedestal by someone creating a more powerful GPU -- something competitors have been struggling to do for a long time.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen examining each company's financials, Nvidia also starts to pull away.\n\nNvidia's stock is cheaper than Supermicro's\n\nBoth companies are growing rapidly, and their projections for the next quarter are also quite strong. In Q4 of FY 2024 (ending Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. It also gave guidance for Q1 revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% growth.\n\nSupermicro also delivered strong results, with its Q2 FY 2024 (ending Dec. 31) revenue rising 103% to $3.67 billion. For its next quarter, Supermicro projects growth of 188% to 219%, placing it in the same realm as Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia experienced the first wave of GPU demand, Supermicro's growth is just starting. However, the stock already responded with strong price appreciation because investors know what kind of growth to expect based on Nvidia's performance over the past year.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro's stock is much more expensive than Nvidia's on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nUsing a forward P/E ratio when a company is undergoing a massive change is wise, as it uses analyst projections to value it. There is still room for error (as no one has a crystal ball), but it gives investors an idea of what they're paying for.\n\nBecause Nvidia is cheaper from this metric and has stronger growth and vital product positioning, I think it's a much better buy than Super Micro Computer.\n\nShould the strong AI demand persist for a few years, both stocks could be excellent picks, but Nvidia remains the king of AI investment opportunities right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The AI arms race between the US and China is heating up",
        "content": "Tech billionaires aren’t the only ones fighting for control of AI. The US and China are too.\n\nThe two world superpowers are competing with each other for everything from the intellectual know-how to design AI hardware and software to the raw materials that power artificial intelligence systems. Both are also using government subsidies to spur new advancements.\n\nWhere the US holds a commanding lead at the moment is the development of generative AI systems such as large language models (LLMs), according to Frank Long with Goldman Sachs' (GS) office of applied innovation. These models hoover up existing data and use it as the basis for chatbots like Open AI's ChatGPT.\n\nAnother advantage for the US is that it can place export restrictions on high-performance semiconductors designed by companies like Nvidia (NVDA) that are in intense demand across the AI world. That, for now, is keeping development of the most sophisticated LLMs out of China’s reach, Long said. Nvidia is now one of the world's most valuable companies due to soaring demand for AI computing power. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nChina, however, is countering with its own maneuvers. It is restricting the export of chipmaking metals gallium and germanium to the US while also reportedly amassing a new $27 billion chip fund to back its own major projects.\n\nThe fierce competition for AI talent between the two countries turned up a notch this past week when the US Justice Department unsealed an indictment charging a Chinese national and former Google (GOOG, GOOGL) AI software developer with stealing 500 files of confidential code that the tech giant uses for its supercomputing data centers to train LLMs.\n\nThe government alleged that after stealing the intellectual property the defendant began simultaneously working for rival companies in China.\n\nThe charges “are the latest illustration of the lengths affiliates of companies based in the People’s Republic of China are willing to go to steal American innovation,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.\n\n'Horse race'\n\nThe fight for global supremacy of AI was a hot topic of discussion earlier this month at the Web Summit’s annual technology conference in Doha, Qatar, an event that attracted investors and tech executives from around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI leaders from the public and private sectors acknowledged that the US and China currently have the edge. The countries currently rank No. 1 and No. 2 in Tortoise Media'sGlobal AI Index, which measures nations based on AI investment, innovation, and implementation.\n\nBut the leaders also said at the summit that it's too soon to know which countries over time will leverage the technology to the greatest economic and societal advantage. Singapore, for example, is now No. 3 in Tortoise's index after moving up rapidly in recent years. Singapore is climbing the ranks of AI powers. (Photo by Roslan RAHMAN / AFP) (Photo credit should read ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (ROSLAN RAHMAN via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it's not going to be as straightforward of a horse race — this person or that person, this country or that country,\" Long said. \"It's going to be a full stack with participants in competition\" for the energy, computing power, data, and models needed for AI systems.\n\nLong and his team at Goldman said in a recent white paper they suspect certain geopolitical “swing states” — like the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea — may be best positioned to tap the technology and form AI alliances.\n\nOther Asian countries beyond China already have several advantages. Taiwan is home to a cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which produces 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors and 68% of semiconductors worldwide. Engineers work in a cleanroom at the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute in Hsinchu, Taiwan. (Ann Wang/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJapan and South Korea are also home to leading semiconductor manufacturing and design firms, and they are setting aside more government funds to drive AI advancement.\n\nJapan allocated $13 billion to the technology in its 2023 budget, up from $8.6 billion in 2022, while South Korea committed $470 billion over the next 23 years to create the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nOther potential AI hubs could emerge in Europe and the Middle East. The Netherlands — home to ASML (ASML) — is already the world’s sole manufacturer of ultraviolet lithography machines, required to fabricate leading-edge semiconductors.

(EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP via Getty Images) (EMMANUEL DUNAND via Getty Images)\n\nThe UAE has a $10 billion fund to invest in late-state technologies, while Israel has also attracted billions in private AI investments.\n\nGlobal power will shift towards nations that produce versus solely consume AI technology, according to Alaa Abdulaal, head of digital foresight for the Riyadh-based multilateral foundation Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO). The group's mission is to recommend government policies that promote access to technology.\n\n\"It cannot be only done by government itself,\" Abdulaal said. \"It needs to take a cooperative approach, where we have at the same table the private sector, public sector, civil society — all of them sitting together to come up with the right set of frameworks for AI.\"\n\n'Getting much closer'\n\nToday, most countries have adopted, at minimum, a national strategy to develop and protect against the potential risks of AI. And some have cleared the way for regulations, though none have been tested against market forces.\n\nIn March, the EU is expected to adopt new legal restraints around AI. Earlier this year the bloc's member states signaled their agreement with the AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate the technology.\n\nFederal laws specific to AI don’t exist yet in the US or UK, and it’s unknown whether that will happen.\n\nIn October, President Biden issued an executive order to encourage safe AI development, including privacy protections. More than a dozen US states have adopted multiple AI-related laws. President Joe Biden speaks about government regulations on artificial intelligence systems during an event in the East Room of the White House last year. (Evan Vucci/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe UK, for its part, rolled out a “National AI Strategy” in 2022 and committed roughly $4 billion in chip development subsidies. The nation has also attracted the third-largest level of private investment in AI, behind the US and China.\n\nState subsidies and export bans may not hold sway forever as nations compete, said Jihad Tayara, CEO of Evoteq, a Dubai-based company that facilitates public-private collaborations to build AI into public infrastructure.\n\n\"It's getting much closer,\" Tayara said of the digital divide, noting that most nations have access to high-speed 5G data capabilities.\n\nAnd human capital, along with access to open-source models, will matter too.\n\n\"Today we're seeing open-source models emerging that are in many use cases equivalent in capability to the absolute most frontier models,\" Long said.\n\nNations that prepare their workforces to develop and implement AI models will gain a considerable edge, Abdulaal said.\n\n\"This opportunity cannot be seen unless we have the right people in place.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Stock bubble fears are overblown despite Magnificent 7's rally: Wall Street analysts",
        "content": "The market’s relentless rally has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 25% from its October lows, fueled by gains in only a handful of stocks.\n\nLeading the charge is AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The chipmaker has gained more than 80% since the start of the year, helping drive the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to record levels.\n\nThe concentrated outperformance has prompted some on Wall Street to warn the rally has gone too far and declare stocks are in bubble territory.\n\nMarket concentration has surged to a multi-decade high. The 10 largest US stocks now account for 33% of S&P 500 market cap and 25% of S&P 500 earnings, according to Goldman Sachs data.\n\nBut concerns over narrow market participation and frothiness may be misguided. Several top Wall Street strategists made it clear on Yahoo Finance’s \"Morning Brief\" last week that there’s reason to believe the market will keep going up.\n\n\"This might be the best sell side trick out there right now… I don't think that's justified,\" Citi US Equity Strategy Director Drew Petit said of the bubble fear on Yahoo Finance Live. \"It’s actually a lot healthier than people are giving it credit for.\"\n\nStrong quarterly results from big tech have bolstered the bull case. Nvidia posted another blow out quarter thanks to surging AI demand, while Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) topped expectations.\n\nHigher profit margins and proven returns are two reasons Wedbush analyst Dan Ives describes the current market environment as a \"1995 moment\" rather than comparing it to the start of the dotcom bubble.\n\n\"This is nowhere near the 1999/2000 period in our view as the sky high valuations, lack of monetization/ infrastructure, weak balance sheets, froth business models, and macro backdrop was in a totally different world back then compared to what we see today,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients.\n\nCiti's head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely echoed Ives’s bullish view on tech, telling Yahoo Finance he \"doesn’t see any end in sight.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We've got a long way to go until we're going to start ringing the alarm bells or even hear a tinkling of bells,\" Danely told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBeyond tech and beneath the surface, underlying trends are positive. Market breadth — an indication of bullish sentiment — has slowly started to improve. The S&P 500 equal weight index (SPXEW) and small caps outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month.\n\n\"The broadening out we’re seeing is happening in a stealthy way,\" Charles Schwab’s Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance, adding that churn under the surface is \"not a bad thing.\"\n\nAnd, it’s important to note, history says elevated concentration isn’t necessarily indicative of a market top. Goldman Sachs analyzed market concentrations spanning the past 100 years, and found the S&P 500 rallied more often than not following past concentration peaks.\n\n\"One consistent pattern around periods of elevated concentration is large swings in Momentum,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider wrote in a note to clients. \"While the performance of the high Momentum leaders was inconsistent, the previous laggards appreciated in absolute terms in every episode. This supports our view that a \"catch up\" by laggards is more likely to interrupt the ongoing Momentum rally than a 'catch down' by the recent market leaders.\"\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Microsoft",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nvidia's high-end GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks in data centers, while Microsoft is a leading investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been integrating OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into its cloud, search, and productivity tools.\n\nOver the past three years, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 600% while Microsoft's stock has rallied just over 70%. Nvidia was clearly the better play on the booming AI market, but will it continue to outperform Microsoft over the next few years? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia remains the ultimate AI play\n\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended this January, Nvidia's revenue surged 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 288%. That marked a dizzying acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe company struggled in fiscal 2023 as the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown throttled its sales of gaming GPUs. The crypto market's meltdown exacerbated that pressure as disillusioned miners flooded the market with secondhand GPUs.\n\nThe macro headwinds also drove some companies to rein in their purchases of new data center GPUs.\n\nBut in fiscal 2024, the soaring popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms sparked a buying frenzy in its data center GPUs. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC and crypto markets recovered.\n\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024, and the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a wide margin. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 39%. Those growth rates are astonishing, but its stock still doesn't look terribly expensive at 39 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia seems like a simple way to profit from the growth of the generative AI market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates will have a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. But investors shouldn't overlook its longer-term challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD is rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, its top cloud customers are developing their own first-party chips, and start-ups like Groq are creating faster dedicated chips to process natural language queries. Chinese chipmakers could also launch alternative AI chips to counter the export curbs on Nvidia's top-tier chips.\n\nMicrosoft is a more balanced play on the AI market\n\nMicrosoft is more diversified. Its sprawling ecosystem houses its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Bing search engine, Xbox gaming business, and Surface hardware devices.\n\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both rose 7% as the expansion of its cloud business -- which includes Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 -- offset the slower growth of its Windows, Surface, and Xbox divisions, which all faced fierce headwinds as the PC and gaming markets cooled off in a post-pandemic world.\n\nBut for fiscal 2024, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 15% and 19%, respectively, as the growth of its cloud business accelerates again. That acceleration was driven by the integration of OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into Microsoft's cloud-based services.\n\nAs result, Microsoft's Azure -- the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform -- has been growing faster than the market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as its third-place competitor, Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to have a CAGR of 14% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 16%. Those estimates assume its cloud business will continue to expand, the PC market will recover, and its acquisition of Activision Blizzard will significantly strengthen its Xbox gaming division.\n\nThose growth rates suggest Microsoft is still a sound way to profit from the expansion of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets -- but its stock isn't cheap at 30 times next year's earnings. If Microsoft's cloud business loses its momentum or antitrust regulators challenge its investments in OpenAI, its valuations could decline and drive its stock lower.\n\nThe better AI play: Nvidia\n\nNvidia and Microsoft are both promising plays on the AI market, but Nvidia's simpler business model, higher growth rates, and more reasonable valuations make it the better buy. Nvidia's investors should keep an eye on the competitive and regulatory headwinds, but it could be years before any of those challenges limit its growth.\n\nUntil then, Nvidia will continue to sell the market's best shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could even eclipse Microsoft's market cap in just a few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Inflation, retail sales, and the market rally broadens: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks finished the week lower after a sell-off in tech led the markets lower Friday as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses for the week, falling more than 1%.\n\nStill, the equal-weighted S&P 500 logged a weekly gain for the 7th-straight week as investors continue to look outside the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech leaders to power the next leg of the market rally.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors will face the final major test before the Federal Reserve's March 20 meeting when the February Consumer Prince Index (CPI) report out Tuesday offers an updated look at inflation. Retail sales and consumer sentiment reports will also feature on the economic calendar in the back half of the week.\n\nA lighter earnings schedule is on deck with Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Adobe (ADBE), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) highlighting the list of quarterly reports.\n\nPrice check\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said repeatedly the central bank wants more \"confidence\" in inflation's path downwardbefore cutting interest rates.\n\nTuesday's CPI reading follows a hotter-than-expected January report that showed inflation's decline could be \"bumpy,\" and prompted investors to price in fewer interest rate cuts this year.\n\nFor February, Wall Street expects headline inflation to log an annual gain of 3.1%, unchanged from the headline number in January, according to estimates from Bloomberg. Prices are set to rise 0.4% on a month-over-month basis, an increase from the 0.3% rise seen in January. People shop at a Target store in Manhattan on March 5, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy, prices are expected to have increased 3.7% year over year, a slowdown from the 3.9% increase seen in January. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, lower than the 0.4% increase seen in January.\n\n\"January's CPI data came in hotter than expected and renewed concerns about how quickly inflation could be brought to a heel,\" Wells Fargo's team of economists led by Jay Bryson wrote in a research note on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Despite the strong start to the year, we ultimately believe the disinflation trend remains in place. We expect the February data to show that while inflation remains frustratingly high, the underlying trend is not strengthening.\"\n\nRetail rebound?\n\nIn January, retail sales posted their steepest decline since March 2023.\n\nBut economists don't expect that trend continued in February.\n\nEconomists expect Thursday morning's report will show retail sales grew 0.8% month over month in February, a rebound from the 0.8% decline seen in the first month of the year.\n\nExcluding autos and gas, economists project sales increased 0.2% month over month compared to a 0.5% decline in January, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\n\"Retail sales will bounce back in February following the weather-related weakness in January and the stronger tax refund season,\" wrote economists at Oxford Economics in a note on Friday, \"which would leave consumption growth on track for an above-2% annualized gain in Q1, a strong pace.\"\n\nA shift in the market\n\nThe market action following Friday's jobs report showed a distinct shift in trading action.\n\nAfter weeks of an AI-fueled stock market rally, Nvidia (NVDA) fell nearly 5%. Other popular tech trades that caught a bid in the AI euphoria also slumped, including roughly 4% drops from Arm Holdings (ARM) and Dell (DELL), among others.\n\nThe move follows a divergence in the Magnificent Seven trade that has emerged —notably, lagging performance from Apple and Tesla. This, strategists have argued, could continue to open a lane for a broadening of the market rally.\n\nThis trend was seen throughout the week, with the equal-weight S&P 500 hitting its first record high in more than two years. Both that index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) outperformed the broader market during Friday's sell-off.\n\n\"We think the Mag Seven is going to become the Lag Seven,\" Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n\"At this point in time, we're going to start to see a broadening out of this market.\"\n\nFewer companies mention recession\n\nJohnson's call for a broadening out of the market rally has been a common one across Wall Street to start 2024. The case for other stocks to rally is rooted in increasing earnings estimates for stocks outside the tech leaders and the overall health of the US economy.\n\nThat story largely remains intact. JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli noted after the February jobs report that continued strength in the labor market pushed the firm's outlook for second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) to 1.5% annualized from 0.5%.\n\nStrategists believe these increased economic forecasts will be reflected in company earnings beyond just tech stocks. And companies are telling a similar story.\n\nDuring earnings calls spanning from Dec. 15 to March 7, 47 S&P 500 companies cited the term \"recession,\" according to research from FactSet. It was the lowest number of companies mentioning the phrase in two years and was below both the five- and 10-year averages of mentions.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, February (3% previously)\n\nEarnings:Asana (ASAN), Casey's (CASY), Oracle (ORCL), Vail Resorts (MTN)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, February (89.9 previously) Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, February (+0.4% expected, +0.3% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, February (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); CPI, year-over-year, February (+3.1% expected, +3.1% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, February (+3.7% expected, +3.9% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, February (+1.4% previously)\n\nEarnings: Allbirds (BIRD), Clover (CLOV), Kohl's (KSS), Manchester United (MANU), On Holdings (ONON)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending March 8 (+9.7%)\n\nEarnings: Dollar Tree (DLTR), Lennar (LEN), Vera Bradley (VRA), Williams-Sonoma (WSM)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending March 9 (217,000 previously); Retail sales, month-over-month, February (+0.8% expected, -0.8% previously); Retail sales ex auto and gas, February (+0.2% expected, -0.5% previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, February (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); PPI, year-over-year, February (+0.9% previously)\n\nEarnings:Adobe (ORCL), Blink (BLNK), Build-A-Bear (BBW), Dollar General (DG), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: University of Michigan consumer sentiment, March preliminary (77.0 expected, 76.9 previously); Import prices, month-over-month, February (+0.2% expected, +0.8% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, February (+0.1% expected, +0.8 previously); Industrial production, month-over-month, February (+0.0% expected, -0.1% previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings set for release.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Could Nvidia Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Buying solid companies and holding on to their shares for a very long time is a proven way to make money in the stock market, as this simple strategy helps investors take advantage of the power of compound growth and also capitalize on disruptive and secular growth opportunities.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a prime example of what a successful buy-and-hold investment can deliver over the long run. An investor who put $10,000 into Nvidia stock a decade ago and held on would be sitting on a position worth more than $1.8 million right now and more than $1.9 million with dividends reinvested. NVDA Chart\n\nBut can Nvidia replicate this feat and help new investors become millionaires if they start with a $10,000 investment?\n\nIs it realistic to expect such massive gains from Nvidia again?\n\nNvidia has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade, and now, with a market cap of just over $2.25 trillion, it's the third-largest company in the world. So for Nvidia to grow by 100 times from here, its market cap would have to exceed $200 trillion. That looks absurd: Last year, the entire global gross domestic product (GDP) was an estimated $105 trillion, up just 5% from 2022.\n\nNvidia's market cap, therefore, is equivalent to about 2% of the global GDP. If it maintained that proportion over the long haul, it would be worth $200 trillion when the world economy had grown to an almost incomprehensibly large $10 quadrillion. That may not happen in our lifetime -- global GDP has grown by between 2% and 5% a year since 1980 in most years, except during the 2008-2009 recession and at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nAssuming the global economy grows at an optimistic 5% a year, it would take more than nine decades for it to grow to $10 quadrillion. We can't know if Nvidia will even be around then. However, going by the company's prospects and the multiple markets that it serves with its graphics processing units (GPUs), there is a good chance it could turn out to be a solid long-term bet -- even if it's unlikely to turn a $10,000 investment into a million-dollar position again in our lifetimes.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut if you have that much in investible cash after covering your bills, paying off any high-interest debt you have, and building up an emergency fund, putting $10,000 into Nvidia as a part of a diversified portfolio could indeed help you get closer to your financial goals.\n\nMultiple catalysts make Nvidia a solid long-term buy\n\nAs the following chart shows, Nvidia's growth has taken off from the end of 2022. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe company's data center business has played a central role in this growth. It delivered a record $47.5 billion in revenue in its recently concluded fiscal 2024, which was a massive 217% increase. The data center business produced 79% of Nvidia's total revenue of $60.1 billion.\n\nThis business segment is moving the needle in a big way for Nvidia as customers are lining up to buy its most powerful GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. From Alphabet to Amazon to Meta Platforms and many more, Nvidia has an illustrious list of customers for its flagship H100 processor. More importantly, it will launch its next-generation H200 AI GPU soon, and demand for this chip is already high.\n\nHowever, this is not the only GPU opportunity Nvidia is set to benefit from. The company's gaming business has also gained solid momentum and could generate billions of dollars in annual revenue for the company in the future.\n\nIt is worth noting that Nvidia remains the dominant player in the market for both AI and PC GPUs. While its share of the discrete PC GPU market reportedly stands at more than 80%, Wells Fargo recently estimated that it controls a whopping 98% of the AI GPU market. Precedence Research forecasts that the global GPU market's revenue will grow from $42 billion in 2022 to $773 billion in 2032, an annualized growth rate of almost 34%. Given Nvidia's market share now, its outstanding pace of growth looks sustainable.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia is looking to increase its reach beyond these two markets. For instance, it is reportedly looking to get into the custom AI chip market, a lucrative growth opportunity. On the other hand, Nvidia's professional visualization business is now growing at an impressive pace as well.\n\nThe company generated $463 million in revenue in the professional visualization segment last quarter, a jump of 105% from the prior-year period. This segment includes the company's Omniverse digital twin platform and graphics cards used in workstation PCs. For the full fiscal year, its professional visualization revenue was just $1.6 billion, so it is still a small segment for the company, but the opportunity here is huge, and the company has already started capitalizing on it.\n\nAs such, there are multiple reasons this semiconductor giant could continue to grow at a healthy pace in the long run. This is also evident from the company's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which stands at just 0.12. NVDA PEG Ratio Chart\n\nThe PEG ratio is a forward-looking metric that's calculated by dividing a company's price-to-earnings ratio by the annual earnings growth it is expected to deliver, usually over five years. A result of less than 1 indicates that a stock is undervalued when compared to the growth it could deliver.\n\nSo, investors looking to add a potential long-term winner to their portfolios should consider buying Nvidia stock right now, as it could help them in their quest to become millionaires.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "So far in 2024 shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) haven’t done well at all, falling 28% and 11.5%, respectively. As a result, it appears that they aren’t so “magnificent” and their spots in the Magnificent 7 should probably be taken by other tech stocks.\n\nTherefore, in this column I will take the initiative by selecting their replacements. Among the criteria I have used in choosing replacements are the strength of firms’ businesses, the extent to which they have positive outlooks and the performance of their stocks over the last year. I’ll also add an extra nominee in case another one of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks start stumbling soon.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is benefiting tremendously from selling servers and other hardware that work in tandem with chips that produce artificial intelligence. Last quarter, for example, its top line more than doubled versus the same period a year earlier, while its bottom line climbed to $296 million from $176 million during the identical quarter in 2022.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the continued, rapid proliferation of AI and data centers’ affinity for SMCI’s products, the firm has a very bright future. Supporting this, investment bank Arguswrote that SMCI is primed for multiple years of strong top-line growth and margin expansion. The bank even compared the stock to Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their earlier days.\n\nSMCI stock had jumped an incredible 299% in the last three months and 1,028% over the last year.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) provides software that automates IT tasks, and the company launched a very successful AI-powered app in Q3 of 2023.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Bill McDermott, indicated in January that NOW had been able to charge extraordinarily high prices for its AI app. He also suggested that the firm’s AI app raises companies’ productivity levels by 40%-50%. Going forward, NOW should continue to benefit from companies’ strong demand for high-quality AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, NOW’s top line jumped 26% versus the same period a year earlier, and it expects its income from operations to soar 29% during the current quarter. Then last month, investment bank Argus hiked its price target on NOW stock to $910 from $770.

        "title": "Meet the 5 Stocks That Have Contributed Almost All of the S&amp;P 500's 2024 Gains",
        "content": "Containing the 500 largest publicly-traded U.S. companies by market cap, the S&P 500 is arguably the best indicator of the performance of the overall U.S. stock market. At least, it has been in the past.\n\nBut something is happening that's making the index's performance somewhat misleading. As of March 6, the S&P 500 has gained 7.0% year to date. But 6.5 percentage points of that gain are due to the performance of just five companies.\n\nYou may be wondering how this is possible, given the index is so massive. Are the other 495 companies really putting up mediocre results?\n\nLet's look at these growth stocks, their impact on the market, and what it means for your portfolio (whether or not you're invested in them). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2024 market leaders\n\nThe following table showcases why huge gains from overweighted components of the S&P 500 can move the whole index.\n\nCompany YTD Gain Weight in S&P 500 Percentage Point Contribution to S&P 500 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 79.2% 5.0% 3.9% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) 40.2% 2.6% 1.0% Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) 14.2% 3.7% 0.5% Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) 33.8% 1.5% 0.5% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 6.6% 7.0% 0.5%\n\nData sources: Slickcharts and YCharts as of Mar. 6, 2024. YTD = year to date.\n\nNvidia and Meta Platforms alone are responsible for over half of this year's gains for the index. Microsoft is another interesting case; as the highest-weighted component of the S&P 500 (yes, even more than Apple), it doesn't take a big move for it to affect the index. Drugmaker Eli Lilly makes up just 1.5% of the S&P 500, but it's strong rally this year has been enough to move the index half a percentage point higher.\n\nCombined, these five companies make up 19.7% of the S&P 500. A little math tells us that, on average, the other 495 companies have gained just 0.7% this year (adjusted for their weightings in the index).\n\nDissecting the S&P 500's moves\n\nThere are a few ways to unpack this information. The obvious takeaway is that the market's roaring start really is due to a handful of companies. But a more subtle realization is that the market will have difficulty sustaining these gains from these leading constituents.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Eli Lilly have put up big numbers. The story has carried over into 2024, but it may soon begin to run out of steam through no fault of these five companies. Data by YCharts.\n\nAs we've seen repeatedly in past market cycles, valuations can only expand so much before fundamentals must catch up. The good news is that earnings from this cohort are growing. Nvidia is arguably the best example.\n\nOn the surface, its 74.4 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio looks sky-high, but analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to roughly double over the next year, so its forward P/E ratio is a much more reasonable 36.1. In fact, it's on par with Microsoft while coming in lower than Tesla, Amazon, and Eli Lilly.\n\nGrowth can make rapid run-ups in stock prices justifiable. It's just that the faster and higher stock prices run, especially when they have this level of impact on the broader market, the more stretched the market becomes and the more room there is for a sell-off.\n\nThe path forward\n\n2023 and 2024 have been fascinating years in the market. The highest-weighted companies are also some of the market's top gainers -- concentrating the gains of the overall index in just a few companies.\n\nIt doesn't matter where the gains come from if you own an S&P 500 index fund, but if you don't own these companies, your returns may vary wildly from the broad market's. The tech sector alone makes up 29.5% of the index. In fact, it's the only sector to have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years. So, if you didn't own tech or the market's top movers outside of tech, it would have been challenging to beat the market during this period.\n\nNo one knows what will happen over the next five years, but we do know what has driven the market over the last five. Market dynamics can help you understand what's happening in the short term -- the trick is to not lose sight of what really matters, which is achieving your financial goals.\n\nHitching a ride on a hot trend to make a quick buck is a common way to lose money. A better approach is to focus on a long-term investment thesis and compounding wealth over time. The real gains in Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Eli Lilly have come to those who have held the stocks for five years, a decade, or even longer. The road hasn't been easy as most of these companies have endured brutal sell-offs, most recently in 2022's bear market.\n\nIf you want to invest in growth but don't know where to start, there are plenty of inexpensive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worth checking out that achieve diversification and the benefits of a hands-off approach.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The stock market has seen a lot of movement in recent years, with external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, a subsequent economic downturn, and a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) creating plenty of peaks and valleys. In fact, the Nasdaq Composite index plunged 33% in 2022, then rose 43% the following year.\n\nHowever, recent volatility appears to be subsiding as inflation eases and excitement over tech fuels a market recovery. As a result, now is an excellent time to dedicate a larger portion of your portfolio to the expanding tech market and reap the rewards long into the future.\n\nHere are three no-brainer stocks I'd buy right now without hesitation.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has appeared unstoppable over the last year as it became the poster child for AI. The company's stock is up 260% since last March, rallying investors while snapping up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips.\n\nIncreased demand for AI services boosted sales of graphics processing unit (GPU), the chips crucial for training AI models. As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has massively profited from rising demand for GPUs.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024 ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nNvidia has massive potential as the AI market develops, and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates reflect this. The chart above shows Nvidia's earnings could reach just over $34 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the tech giant's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 35 yields a stock price of $1,197.\n\nLooking at its current position, these projections would see Nvidia's stock increase 39% by fiscal 2027, making it a screaming buy right now.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nLike Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has much to gain from the rise of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% until at least 2030. Its massive growth potential suggests Nvidia will be able to retain its dominance and despite newcomers like AMD.\n\nAMD was slightly late to the AI party. However, it is making moves to take a slice of the $200 billion industry and could see major gains over the long term.\n\nLast December, the company unveiled its new MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nMoreover, AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. This segment is expected to see a significant boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe table above shows AMD's earnings could reach top $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia, multiplying this figure by AMD's forward P/E of 58 yields a stock price of $403, projecting that its stock will nearly double in price within two years.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer almost 30 years ago. The company has expanded to multiple industries, from becoming a titan of e-commerce to leading the cloud market, developing space satellites, and venturing into grocery, gaming, consumer tech, and more.\n\nAmazon dominates e-commerce in dozens of countries, a market expected to hit $3.6 trillion in 2024 and develop at a CAGR of 10% through 2028. The company will likely continue profiting from the segment's tailwinds for years.\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In Q4 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three segments.\n\nMoreover, AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nLike Nvidia and AMD, EPS estimates project massive potential for Amazon's stock. This table indicates that the e-commerce giant's earnings will achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by Amazon's forward P/E of 42, you get a stock price of $294.\n\nFrom its current position, this would see Amazon's stock rise 68% over the next two fiscal years. Alongside dominating positions in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon is a no-brainer buy this March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The semiconductor chip is one of the most important parts of artificial intelligence (AI). Graphics processing units (GPUs) play a major role in generative AI applications, including machine learning, accelerated computing, and large language models (LLMs).\n\nAt the center of GPU manufacturing is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Demand for its flagship A100 and H100 chips is soaring, and investors haven't been shy about cheering on the stock. As of the time of this writing, Nvidia is the world's third-most-valuable company by market cap -- handily ahead of Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nInvestors may not realize that Nvidia is more than just a hardware developer. The company has a budding software business and is funneling capital into several other growth drivers, including robotics and voice-powered AI assistants.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the current state of Nvidia's business. I'll also assess why software could prove to be a lucrative source of growth for the company in the long run.\n\nThe chip business is booming\n\nFor Nvidia's fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28, 2024, the company increased revenue 126% year over year to $60.9 billion. The majority of this growth was due to rising interest in GPUs. This is captured in Nvidia's data center segment, which grew 217% annually to $47.5 billion last year.\n\nNvidia is considered the market standard for high-performance GPUs and has amassed superior pricing power over the competition. This dynamic not only influenced the company's robust top-line growth but also played a significant role in its profitability. In fiscal 2024, the company grew free cash flow by more than sixfold and increased its gross margin from 56.9% in fiscal 2023 to 72.7%.\n\nThe most encouraging part about all this is that Nvidia's growth is coming almost entirely from the chip business. But during the earnings call, management subtly dropped a hint at what the company's next frontier could look like.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSomething bigger could be on the horizon\n\nDuring the recent earnings call, Nvidia's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress stated that the company \"also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4.\" This is a big deal because it showcases Nvidia's ambitions to build beyond semiconductors.\n\nMoreover, while Nvidia currently dominates the GPU market, competition from Amazon, Microsoft, and Advanced Micro Devices is heating up. Although it's hard to know for sure, I suspect that as more chips come to market, Nvidia will gradually begin to lose its command of the market. As such, investors should anticipate some margin deterioration at some point in the years ahead.\n\nNevertheless, the software business could represent a silver lining amid rising competition in the chip space -- namely, software tends to carry much higher margins than hardware. Even if other players start eating at Nvidia's market share in the GPU space, the company has identified a fast-growing, high-margin business to mitigate this risk.\n\nAdditionally, while reaching a $1 billion revenue run rate is impressive, the software business is still small compared to Nvidia's core data center operation. However, if recent demand trends are any indication, the software platform could become a major source of growth sooner rather than later, as Nvidia offers an end-to-end AI networking solution.\n\nHow could Nvidia leverage software?\n\nI see two areas where Nvidia can deploy its software. The first is in voice-powered AI assistants. Competitors, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, have all shown an interest in speech-recognition software. This isn't surprising, considering industry estimates suggest that the addressable market for speech-recognition software could reach $50 billion by 2029.\n\nNvidia is the latest megacap tech business to join the party, following an investment in SoundHound AI. While SoundHound AI is still quite small, the long-term prospects of a partnership with Nvidia could prove lucrative.\n\nThe other area where I think Nvidia could play a big role in AI software applications is robotics. Following news of the SoundHound AI deal, Nvidia joined OpenAI, Microsoft, Jeff Bezos, and Intel Capital in a $675 million funding round in Figure AI -- a developer of humanoid robots. According to Goldman Sachs, the addressable market for humanoid robots could reach $38 billion by 2035, given their potential to disrupt the labor market in industries such as manufacturing and logistics.\n\nRobotics could be an especially interesting area for Nvidia, as the company can help further develop this technology through both its chip and software businesses. I think Nvidia's growth is just getting started. I think the company can keep up the momentum for years to come, and I am excited to see how it continues to disrupt the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Most Likely to Deliver a 5X Gain by 2030: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "You won't have to look hard to find well-known stocks that have been multi-baggers in recent years. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) share price has more than quadrupled since 2014. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up more than 9x during the same period. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered a gain of over 10x. Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) stock has soared 7x. Then there's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), with its share price skyrocketing in the ballpark of 19,400%.\n\nBut those impressive returns are now history. Which of these stocks is likely to deliver a 5x gain by 2030?\n\nStrong growth prospects all around\n\nI think all five of these stocks should have strong growth prospects going forward. They share a common tailwind that's likely to blow hard for years to come -- artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud are poised for tremendous growth, in my view, as IT spending shifts from on-premises to the cloud. The scramble to build AI functionality should accelerate this trend. Nvidia will almost certainly be a direct beneficiary of this migration. The company's GPUs remain the favorite chip for powering AI apps.\n\nMeta isn't a cloud provider or a chipmaker. However, the company's open-source approach to developing AI could pay off nicely over the long term. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks that the benefits of this strategy include increased AI safety and security, a greater ability to integrate new AI innovations into Meta's products, and a competitive advantage in hiring the best developers and researchers.\n\nAI isn't the only growth driver for these five stocks, though. Amazon still has plenty of room to run in the e-commerce market and other areas it's expanding into, including healthcare. Microsoft's opportunities include gaming, especially with the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Alphabet has its famous \"other bets,\" such as healthcare-focused Calico and Verily. Meta is investing heavily in developing the metaverse. Nvidia's initial success came from powering gaming apps, and it still represents a major growth market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNarrowing the list\n\nI like all of these stocks. I think all of them could deliver solid long-term returns. But we must narrow the list to pick a winner.\n\nWhich is the first to be eliminated? My pick is Meta. The company won't profit as directly from AI as the three cloud service providers or Nvidia. Meta's big bet on the metaverse might not pay off by 2030 (or possibly ever). Its social media platforms, while continuing to dominate, don't have as much growth potential as they have in the past.\n\nNext on the chopping block for me is Amazon. E-commerce remains the company's biggest revenue source. As mentioned previously, it's still a growth opportunity for Amazon. However, that opportunity isn't as great as the ones that other companies on our list have. This could make it more challenging for Amazon stock to soar by 5x by 2030.\n\nI'm going to reluctantly strike Microsoft off the list as well. My primary determining factor here is valuation. Microsoft's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on Wall Street's consensus five-year growth projections is over 2x, the highest multiple of all of these stocks except Amazon. Granted, those growth projections could be overly pessimistic. Still, I suspect that it would be more difficult for Microsoft stock to increase by 5x going forward because of its starting valuation.\n\nThe finalists\n\nThat leaves two finalists -- Alphabet and Nvidia. Choosing between them is tough.\n\nIn addition to continued growth with its current apps and Google Cloud, Alphabet could have a massive growth driver with its Waymo self-driving car business. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest predicts that the robotaxi market could be worth $9 trillion by 2030. Waymo is likely to be a leader in that market. Google also ranks as a top innovator in quantum computing technology, which could be another game-changer.\n\nAlphabet does face some risks, though. Ark Invest's robotaxi market prediction could be way too optimistic. It could take much longer to achieve the potential for quantum computing than anyone expects. AI-powered virtual assistants could dampen Google Search's growth down the road. Alphabet's \"other bets\" could be disappointing.\n\nWhat about Nvidia? It's arguably the most important company in the world right now. Every other company on our list (plus thousands of others) relies heavily on Nvidia's GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang thinks that the shift to accelerated computing and generative AI \"will drive a doubling of the world's data-center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\" If he's right, Nvidia could realistically deliver a 5x return by 2030.\n\nOn the other hand, NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran believes that Nvidia is the most overvalued \"Magnificent Seven\" stock by far, even factoring in strong growth projections. The company also faces increased competition in the AI chip market, which could grow even stronger over the next few years.\n\nMost likely to deliver a 5x gain\n\nSo which stock is most likely to deliver a 5x gain? I'm going to give the nod to Nvidia. The company should profit from pretty much every technology growth market around -- AI, gaming, self-driving cars, the metaverse, and more. That said, I don't think becoming a five-bagger again will be easy for Nvidia (because of the challenges I've already mentioned).\n\nPerhaps the most important takeaway from this hypothetical exercise is that all of these stocks could make investors plenty of money over the long run. I don't think you'd go wrong with buying Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia as long as you hold onto the stocks long enough.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "With Nvidia Up 80% This Year, Are There Any AI Crypto Tokens You Should Be Buying Now?",
        "content": "For crypto investors, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the one stock to watch for clues about the future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens. As Nvidia's stock goes, so goes the market for AI crypto tokens.\n\nSo with Nvidia shares surging after a monster earnings report in February, AI crypto tokens are also surging. Some are up 300% during the past month, and it all stems from a renewed sense of excitement around the AI market. But are any of these AI crypto tokens actually worth buying?\n\nWhat is Fetch.ai?\n\nRecognizing that it's still the very early innings for artificial intelligence, the one AI crypto token that has my attention right now is Fetch.ai(CRYPTO: FET), which is up almost 400% in the past 30 days and nearly 300% for the year. As of March 7, Fetch.ai had a market cap of $2.2 billion and ranked 51st among all cryptos in terms of overall market cap.\n\nThe goal of the token is to build, deploy, and monetize AI by creating an open network for AI agents. That's a mouthful, but all it really means is that Fetch.ai wants to offer a marketplace for paid AI services.\n\nAnytime you need a task fulfilled by an AI bot, you would theoretically go to the Fetch.ai marketplace and hire the right one to do the job for you. You would then use the Fetch crypto token to pay for the service.\n\nFetch.ai vs. ChatGPT\n\nWhat makes Fetch.ai so interesting is that it sounds very similar to the concept for the new ChatGPT Store, which now enables you to hire customized AI bots to do certain tasks for you. Given that a lot more people know about ChatGPT than Fetch.ai, I'm not entirely convinced that the crypto should be worth $2.2 billion, but you can start to see why some investors are getting excited about its long-term prospects. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhere things get interesting is if Fetch.ai can sell enterprises (i.e., huge corporations) on the concept of these AI bots. One new partner is Deutsche Telekom, which is looking at potential uses for AI bots.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could become a great example of AI bots providing utility on a vast scale, and it ties back to the whole idea of investing in Nvidia in the first place. After all, big blue chips like Deutsche Telekom are the ones that are going to be buying Nvidia's semiconductors and using its data centers.\n\nCaveats for investors\n\nYou definitely need to be doing your due diligence in this sector if you want to benefit from the long-term convergence of AI and crypto. Otherwise, you could wind up in the same situation as we saw with metaverse crypto tokens back in 2021-22.\n\nInvestors sensed a huge market opportunity around the metaverse, and a few big metaverse crypto tokens eventually attained billion-dollar market caps. But nobody these days is buying metaverse crypto tokens.\n\nAnd that's because metaverse crypto tokens never figured out how to appeal to more than young gamers and early tech adopters. Big brands set up shop in the metaverse, hoping to find new customers and new sources of revenue, but things never really turned out as planned.\n\nAnd that's one concern that I have about Fetch.ai. Sure, the idea of using paid AI bots sounds great, but will it ever appeal to a mainstream audience? It would be great to see more examples of people actually using Fetch.ai bots in their daily lives.\n\nShould you just buy Nvidia instead?\n\nIf forced to pick just one AI crypto token right now, it would be Fetch.ai. For a little more than $2 per token, you can theoretically gain access to nearly unlimited upside if the use case for autonomous AI agents in the enterprise market plays out as expected.\n\nThat said, it might be better for risk-averse investors to focus on blue chip names in the AI market such as Nvidia rather than trying to make speculative bets on AI crypto tokens they have never heard of. Picking winners in an emerging tech market is always dicey, and so for now, I'm sticking with Nvidia, up more than 80% for the year, as the best way to play the future in AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "BlackRock manages $10 trillion worth of assets on behalf of its clients, making it the largest company of its kind in the world. It invests in everything from residential and commercial real estate to America's largest technology companies in order to help its clients meet their financial goals.\n\nBlackRock is also the parent company of iShares, which manages more than 1,400 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to place a variety of asset classes at the fingertips of investors of all skill levels.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX) invests in most of the world's top chip companies, which are at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF just completed a stock split\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF delivered a compound annual return of 30% over the last five years, soaring to $680 per share, which made it somewhat inaccessible to smaller investors. As a result, iShares executed a 3-for-1 stock split, which increased the number of shares in circulation threefold, while reducing its stock price by two-thirds.\n\nIt had no impact on the value of the ETF, but investors can now buy in for as little as $237 (as of this writing), making it accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThe momentum in the iShares Semiconductor ETF will likely continue given the sheer size of the AI opportunity. Here's how it could turn a $200,000 investment into more than $1 million over the next 10 years -- but don't worry, investors with any amount of starting capital can benefit from a fivefold return if this scenario plays out.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF invests in the world's top chip stocks, including Nvidia\n\nAI wouldn't exist without the powerful data center chips designed to help developers build, train, and deploy their models. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leader in that segment by a mile, and it's reaping substantial results from the success of its industry-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a market cap of $2.3 trillion as of this writing (only Apple and Microsoft are worth more) and over $1.5 trillion of that value was added in the last 12 months alone. The powerful returns in the iShares Semiconductor ETF lately are no surprise when you consider Nvidia is its largest holding.\n\nThe ETF holds a stake in 30 semiconductor stocks, but it's heavily weighted toward its top five positions, which account for 41.2% of the value of its entire portfolio:\n\nStock ETF Weighting 1. Nvidia 11.27% 2. Advanced Micro Devices 10.33% 3. Broadcom  8.66% 4. Qualcomm 6.21% 5. Intel  4.75%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are as of March 6, 2024, and are subject to change.\n\nWhile Nvidia dominates the market for AI data center chips today, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is now shipping competing hardware. Plus, AMD has an estimated 90% market share in the AI chips designed for edge computing (computers and mobile devices), which could be the industry's next frontier.\n\nOutside of its top five positions, the iShares Semiconductor ETF also holds Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures more than half of the world's chips -- including the data center GPUs designed by Nvidia and AMD. The ETF also holds Micron Technology, a leading producer of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are increasingly important with the rise of AI.\n\nSOXX could turn $200,000 into $1 million within 10 years\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF has returned 60% over the past year, more than doubling the 28% return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. It's even better than the 48% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nThat outperformance isn't an anomaly, because the iShares Semiconductor ETF delivered a compound annual return of 30% over the last five years, and 25% over the last 10 years. The S&P 500 rose 14% and 13% across those time frames, respectively.\n\nIf the iShares Semiconductor ETF were to deliver a 25% annual return over the next 10 years, it would turn an investment of $200,000 into more than $1.8 million. It's a high bar, but Wall Street's estimates for the financial impact of AI are measured in the trillions of dollars. With Nvidia and AMD representing such a large percentage of the ETF, continued outperformance in the coming years can't be ruled out.\n\nBut even if the iShares Semiconductor ETF returned a more modest 15% annually on average over the next decade, it would still deliver a spectacular financial gain for investors. The below table shows how a difference in annual return would affect an initial outlay of $200,000:\n\nInitial Investment Compound Annual Return Balance After 10 Years $200,000 15% $809,111 $200,000 20% $1,238,347 $200,000 25% $1,862,645\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF is a great bet on the future of AI, and its recent stock split gives investors of all experience levels the opportunity to buy in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Can Nvidia Keep Growing by Leaps and Bounds? These 2 Numbers Scream an Emphatic \"Yes.\"",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) caused some jaws to drop with its fourth-quarter results announced a couple of weeks ago. The chipmaker's revenue soared 265% year over year to a record high. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings skyrocketed by 586%. Free cash flow jumped nearly 6.5x.\n\nAny way you look at it, Nvidia's growth story is impressive. But can the company keep growing by leaps and bounds? These two numbers scream an emphatic \"yes.\"\n\nExecutives want more AI -- and soon\n\nBoston Consulting Group (BCG) recently surveyed more than 1,400 C-suite executives. These corporate leaders spanned 14 industries and 50 markets. Despite their varied backgrounds, most of these executives were in agreement on two key things.\n\nFirst, BCG found that 85% of the executives surveyed stated that they plan to increase their organization's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI in 2024. Interestingly, that number is significantly higher than the 71% of respondents who plan to boost overall tech spending.\n\nSecond, a whopping 89% of executives surveyed by BCG ranked AI and generative AI as one of their top three technology priorities for this year. Many of these leaders were dissatisfied with their organizations' progress so far in adopting AI and generative AI.\n\nWhile those two numbers were the key takeaways, in my opinion, from BCG's survey, there was something else that jumped out to me. More than half (54%) of the executives said that they expect to obtain cost savings from AI this year. BCG quoted Hans Vestberg, CEO of Verizon Communications, as saying, \"In every step of the AI journey, we got more and more efficient. The difference with GenAI is that the level of efficiency is so much higher.\"\n\nGreat news for Nvidia\n\nThese sky-high numbers reflecting that executives want more AI (and especially, generative AI) shouldn't be surprising. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in his company's fourth-quarter press release, \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDell Technologies COO Jeff Clark also confirmed in his company's latest quarterly update that the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is exceptionally strong. Clark noted that \"most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey.\"\n\nIt isn't just companies that are jumping on board the AI bandwagon. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress mentioned in the Q4 conference call, \"Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data, and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems.\"\n\nAll of this should add up to sustained sales growth for Nvidia in 2024 and almost certainly beyond. Its Hopper architecture and InfiniBand networking have become the de facto standard for AI infrastructure.\n\nRevenue growth doesn't always translate to stock growth\n\nI don't think there's any doubt whatsoever that Nvidia's revenue will continue to grow by leaps and bounds. The demand for AI is growing faster than the supply for GPUs. But does that mean Nvidia stock will continue soaring as well? Not necessarily.\n\nThe potential problem is that Nvida's share price already reflects a tremendous amount of anticipated growth. Noted valuation expert Aswath Damodaran thinks that Nvidia stock is worth nearly twice what he calculates its fair value is based on compound annual revenue growth of more than 32% over the next five years.\n\nOf course, Nvidia could deliver stronger revenue growth than Damodaran's model assumes. Investors could continue piling into the stock regardless of valuation. Could Nvidia's share price also grow by leaps and bounds well into the future? Perhaps. However, the numbers don't scream \"yes\" as emphatically as they do for the company's revenue growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will examine Wall Street picked these 13 AI stocks for 2024. To see a summary of these stocks, read our article Wall Street Picked These 5 AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nArtificial Intelligence continues to rule the markets and remains the primary factor driving tech stocks to new heights. After causing the stock market to rise in 2023,artificial intelligence remains at the forefront of the media, investors, and even the government. This comes as companies continue assuring investors and the markets at large that they are well-positioned to capture the growth around the revolutionary technology.\n\nLikewise, Wall Street continues to pick AI stocks, given the vast potential for applications of technology in healthcare, finance, and entertainment, among other facets of the economy. Institutional investors and venture capitalists are increasingly investing in emerging AI startups as they look to take advantage of the new frenzy that promises significant returns on investments.\n\nWhile venture investment slowed down in 2023 amid the high-interest rate environment and concerns about recession, that was not the case for the AI sector. Generative AI and AI-related startups attracted close to $50 billion in investments, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection were some startups that attracted the most significant share of venture capital investments. For instance, Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup's AI innovations.\n\nAnthropic is one of the startups that raised close to $2 billion from investors led by Google as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion. More than 70 rounds of $100 million funding went into startups creating AI-powered models, providing infrastructure, and applying the technology to various applications.

Palo Alto’s updated guidance was materially ahead of lowered Street expectations. Nevertheless, its shares pulled back by -8%.”\n\n12. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 82\n\nYTD Performance as of March 7, 2024: +16%\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) is a  pioneer in robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery that  should benefit from artificial intelligence\n\n“There continue to be headwinds entering FY23, but we think ISRG is poised to continue to see improving market dynamics coupled with the potential for the launch of a next-generation system. We would be buyers on today’s weakness,” said Zimmerman, justifying his bullishness.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey during the fourth quarter of 2023, 82 had investments in the robotics company. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)'s largest shareholder is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, owning 4.5 million shares worth $1.52 billion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Baron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Its analytical business model stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of any advancement in AI.\n\nAccording to RBC Capital analyst Mathew Hedberg Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is one of the best AI stocks because the company has a comprehensive data strategy.\n\n“We believe a comprehensive data strategy is a precursor to a gen AI strategy. As such, we believe Snowflake is well positioned given the large amount of customer data on their platform and new gen AI offerings that should help drive incremental workload utilization. That said, we expect the more material impact on results is likely to come in 2025 and beyond as the new products go into general availability,” said Hedberg  in a report.\n\nAs of December 2023, 86 of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research were Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s investors. Brad Gerstner's Altimeter Capital Management was the largest investor through its $2.47 billion stake.\n\nHere is what ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy said about Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSnowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), a cloud-based data platform company, is positioned well to help enterprises better leverage their own data to get the most out of AI models.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nYTD Performance as of March 7, 2024: +52%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is an AI semiconductor company that makes products for data centers, gaming, and embedded segments. Its AMD Vitis AI platform M1300 and Ryzen 8040 laptop process are optimized for AI applications.\n\nAccording to analysts at Barclays, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) investors. Ken Fisher'sFisher Asset Managementwas the largest investor through its $4.18 billion stake.\n\nThis is how White Falcon Capital Management expressed its views on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n6. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nYTD Performance as of March 7, 2024: +20.7%\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of the top artificial intelligence stocks in 2023 as it rallied 95%.\n\nThe rally has continued to gather steam in 2024 on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) expanding its AI offerings by introducing a bot that helps users spot their work charts.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss wrote in a note: “Low investor expectations versus potential top-line upside drivers in price increases, product bundling and data cloud adoption, frame an attractive risk-reward for Salesforce”.\n\nIn December 2023, 131 of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research were the Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s stakeholders. The biggest Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) shareholder out of these is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management due to its $3.93 billion stake.\n\nHere is what Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Picked These 5 AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In 12 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off 16 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best edge computing stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the edge computing market, head over to 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhat is Edge Computing?\n\nEdge computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In simple terms, edge computing involves relocating a part of storage and computing capabilities from the central data center to close proximity of data sources. Rather than sending raw data to a central facility for analysis, computation is performed at the location where the data is generated and only the computed results, like real-time business insights or equipment maintenance predictions, are transmitted back to the central data center. Devices such as smart speakers, watches, and phones, which engage in edge computing by locally collecting and processing data, are already a part of our daily lives.\n\nContrary to what some may think, edge computing doesn't need a separate \"edge network.\" It can work on single devices or routers. If a separate network is used, 5G is important, offering fast wireless connections. This enables cool applications like autonomous drones, remote surgeries, and smart cities. The edge network is useful when on-site computing is too expensive or complex, but fast responses are needed, and the cloud is too distant. Edge networks enable local computation, allowing devices at the edge (like sensors, cameras, or IoT devices) to process data and make decisions without the need to send all information to a centralized cloud for analysis.\n\nThe Intelligent Edge aims to provide faster, more reliable, and efficient processing for quicker decision-making and reduced dependence on centralized cloud systems, which may face issues like latency and bandwidth. However, deploying and managing edge computing infrastructures pose challenges due to technological complexity, overwhelming data volume, and interoperability issues. Gartner predicts that by 2026, at least 50% of edge computing deployments will involve machine learning. AI algorithms are well-suited for the data-rich environments of edge computing, enabling quick and accurate analysis of vast data sets. Integrating AI allows edge devices to independently process and act on collected data without constant communication with a central server. This integration enhances decision-making speed, crucial for applications like real-time inventory management or industrial equipment calibration.\n\nStory continues\n\nEdge Computing Market Size and Key Trends\n\nAccording to Expert Market Research, the global edge computing market is anticipated to grow significantly from $15.54 billion in 2023 to $147.38 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.4% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. This growth is attributed to the rise of autonomous vehicles, connected car networks, and the demand for lightweight frameworks and applications to enhance edge computing efficiency, creating numerous market opportunities. PwCexpects the global market for edge data centers to nearly triple, reaching $13.5 billion in 2024 from $4 billion in 2017. This growth is driven by the potential of locally located data centers to reduce latency, address intermittent connections, and enable data storage and computation in close proximity to end-users. Edge data centers are growing in popularity due to several key trends. The introduction of 5G is a big factor, as these smaller decentralized centers support high-density 5G applications with low costs and latency, especially in smart-city scenarios. Similarly, the increasing use of IoT devices requires quick data processing at the edge to handle the growing amount of information from sensors in homes and industries. Moreover, the adoption of software-defined networking and virtualization technologies allows software to replace expensive hardware in data centers. Lastly, the demand for video streaming and AR/VR is met by these cost-effective edge data centers, reducing latency and providing good performance for users.\n\nRead also: Top 15 Edge Computing Companies in the World\n\nWhat’s New in the Edge Computing Market?\n\nOn January 5, 2024, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) disclosed that it is partnering with American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a global digital infrastructure provider, to accelerate the deployment of a hybrid, multi-cloud computing platform at the edge.

The goal is to help clients address evolving customer requirements and expectations in digital transformation, incorporating technologies like IoT, 5G, AI, and network automation. IBM plans to provide American Tower with a hybrid cloud platform, facilitating the creation of an edge cloud at American Tower's distributed real estate locations.\n\nSimilarly, on February 5, Ernst & Young announced that it has launched the EY Edge Technologies Lab, aiming to forefront edge ecosystem technologies in digital transformation. This initiative focuses on creating real-time, industry-specific use cases and prototypes for edge-centric solutions, integrating technology seamlessly into business operations. Leveraging EY.ai, a platform combining business experience with AI technology, the Lab demonstrates the advantages of embedding AI at the edge to optimize speed, performance, security, reliability, and resiliency for businesses. The Lab uses Dell NativeEdge and collaborates with Microsoft, PTC, GE Digital, Snowflake, and others to enhance business operations and leverage edge technology efficiently.\n\nSome of the best edge computing market leaders to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

Edge Computing Market Size and Best Stocks To Buy\n\nA futuristic datacenter with servers and high-tech equipment, signifying the company's cutting-edge digital technology.\n\nEdge Computing Market Size and Best Stocks To Buy\n\n10. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 44\n\nRanking 10th on our list of edge computing market leaders is Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET). It is a global cloud services provider offering cloud-based security solutions for different platforms, web and application security products, and performance optimization solutions such as content delivery and load balancing. The company also provides a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform called Cloudflare One, along with network services for connectivity, security, and performance.\n\nIn Q4 2023, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) reported adjusted earnings per share of 15 cents, surpassing analysts' expectations of 12 cents. The company's revenue for the quarter was $362.5 million, reflecting a 32% year-over-year increase and beating the anticipated $353 million. Cloudflare achieved record operating cash flow at $85.4 million, equivalent to 24% of total revenue, and set a quarterly free cash flow record at $50.7 million, representing 14% of total revenue.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 44 hedge funds were long Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), compared to 37 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2 million shares worth $165.4 million.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of the edge computing market leaders to watch.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. People want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”\n\n9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) ranks 9th on our list of edge computing market leaders.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”\n\n8. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) provides data solutions globally through Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services, and Corporate Investments segments.

Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 14.6 million shares worth $248 million.\n\n7.

These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.”\n\n6. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nArista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) specializes in developing, marketing, and selling data-driven networking solutions for data center and cloud networking, including AI-driven ethernet switching platforms, campus wired and wireless products, and routing systems. The company serves diverse industries such as internet companies, service providers, financial services, government agencies, media, and telecommunications. Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) ranks 6th on our list of edge computing market leaders\n\nOn February 12, Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) reported Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.08, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $0.37.

(NYSE:ANET) is one of the notable edge computing market leaders.\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management stated the following regarding Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We did a bit of portfolio sculpting during the year, with mixed results. We trimmed Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) several times during the year as it soared. Those trims, a very small one in March at roughly $163 and a larger one in August at $183, don’t look smart with Arista finishing the year at $235 (and up more in January). Arista rose 94% this year. The good news is, Arista finished the year as our second largest holding, at 7.9% of the portfolio.\n\nIf you are wondering how I could sell some Arista at $163 but then hold most of it at $235, the answer is that Arista’s outstanding competitive position in Artificial Intelligence became clearer to me as the year progressed. I felt in March that Arista would earn $8 per share in a few years. I see today that it might earn $8 in 2025.\n\nIt’s possible there is AI-related froth in the Arista stock price, but also probable that Arista will continue to grow rapidly as the computing centers that process AI queries require enormous amounts of data bandwidth. I believe Arista’s routers and switches are the best tools for routing so-called hyperscale traffic. Also, its operating software allows computer giants to manage the kudzu-like growth of their data centers, lowering their total cost of operation.\n\nThe sales of both Arista and Heico reflected my desire to manage PE multiple risk. I keep learning the hard way, however, that trimming your winners generally doesn’t add value. If the valuation is beyond justification, sell the position. If the valuation is high but the business continues to dominate its niche, grow steadily and add value for customers, maybe just take a walk around the block until the urge to sell goes away.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Edge Computing Stocks To Buy.

If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market landscape, head over to 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nThe equity strategy team at UBS has recently shared a forward-looking forecast for potential surprises that might unfold throughout the course of 2024. In a note written by analyst Andrew Garthwaite and his team, they clarified that the predictions outlined carry long odds and are not reflective of the bank's base-case scenario or market consensus. One of the noteworthy surprises highlighted by UBS involves the possibility of China's nominal GDP experiencing a slowdown to 3%, contrary to expectations of acceleration. Additionally, the forecast includes a potential steepening of the yield curve to 2%, challenging current market expectations. Moreover, the UBS team envisions a scenario where a candidate other than Joe Biden or Donald Trump emerges as the victor in the November election, adding an element of unpredictability to the political landscape.\n\nAmong the bold predictions outlined in UBS's report, a particularly interesting insight is the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence tools on productivity. The strategists suggest that these tools are already making a substantial impact and expect that the existing infrastructure could facilitate a 2.5% increase in productivity growth. Drawing parallels to the IT revolution in the late 1990s, such an uptick in productivity could potentially ignite a significant rally for equities. The UBS team forecasts that instead of productivity staying around 1.5%, it could increase to 2.5%. They believe this could lead to lower inflation and a slow decrease in unemployment. If this happens, the central bank might be able to cut interest rates more quickly than what people in the markets expect. The UBS analysts also say that if productivity grows by 2.5%, it could cause a big 20% increase in the S&P 500 throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe United States economy is currently experiencing what some experts are categorizing as a \"Goldilocks\" moment. Economists from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) anticipate faster growth, reduced inflation, and robust job creation in 2024. This outlook stands in stark contrast to the recession fears that prevailed in 2023. The NABE now predicts a 2.2% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024, a more optimistic forecast compared to just two months ago. Inflation, a key concern impacting multiple spending categories, is expected to continue decreasing this year. NABE forecasts a decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to an annual rate of 2.4%, compared to 4.1% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Another important indicator for the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures gauge, is also predicted to ease further. The NABE anticipates the Federal Reserve initiating a reduction in its benchmark interest rate between April and June, aiming to lower borrowing costs for individuals and businesses. The record-high performance of the stock market, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs, contributes to the positive sentiment in the American stock market.\n\nEd Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Yardeni Research, told CBS News on February 26:\n\n\"As occurred during the second half of the 1990s, the stock market is having a significantly positive wealth effect on the economy now that the major stock market indexes are at record highs.”\n\nTo benefit from the growth potential in the stock markets, some of the best stocks to buy include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe referred to long-term hedge funds that rarely buy and sell stocks, then found 13 stocks that they have held consistently for at least 10 years. These are the best stocks to buy and hold forever. These hedge funds include Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nBest Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever\n\n13. The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nThe Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is a quick-service restaurant company operating in the United States and globally. It operates through three segments – Wendy's U.S., Wendy's International, and Global Real Estate & Development. On February 15, The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of March 1. It is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 31.4 million shares worth $613 million. Trian Partners has held a stake in The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) consistently since 2013.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the best stocks to buy.\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund made the following comment about The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)’s is the second-largest quick-service burger chain in the U.S. This iconic brand generates $13.3 billion of systemwide sales from 7,095 restaurant locations around the world. Wendy’s is an asset-light franchisor that earns most of its profits from royalties, franchise fees and rent. The business is insulated from food and labor inflation since 95% of the restaurant base is owned and operated by franchisees. Wendy’s topline has proven remarkably resilient through diverse economic climates, producing 12 straight years of positive same-restaurant sales. The company is well-positioned for accelerating topline growth due to its recent launch of a breakfast menu, steady market share gains, international expansion and new restaurant openings. Despite these favorable characteristics, we had an opportunity to purchase shares at ~17x free cash flow, representing a discount to its quick-service restaurant peers as well as private market transactions.”\n\n12. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nMoody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is a global risk assessment firm with two main segments – Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service. The company provides institutional risk management, credit research and structured finance solutions, credit ratings, and assessment services for debt obligations and entities. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) declared a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, a 10.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is payable on March 15, to shareholders on record as of February 23. On February 5, Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase authority.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds were bullish on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), compared to 58 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 24.6 million shares worth $9.6 billion.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyze Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”\n\n11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the American multinational beverage giant, is one of the best stocks to buy. On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15. The company’s revenue in Q4 2023 increased 7% year-over-year to $10.8 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $150 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 400 million shares worth $23.5 billion.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It’s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a “scarcity premium” given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 – 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.”\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 – 6% over that time frame.”\n\n10. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is an integrated payments company operating globally, providing credit cards, charge cards, banking, and related payment and financing products. The company operates through four segments – U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services, International Card Services, and Global Merchant and Network Services. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) provided optimistic guidance for 2024, surpassing analyst expectations, despite the Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) and revenue falling short of estimates. American Express plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.70, starting from the Q1 declaration. The projected 2024 EPS is between $12.65 and $13.15, exceeding the consensus estimate of $12.30, with an anticipated revenue growth of 9%-11%. This guidance implies a 2024 revenue range of $66.0 billion to $67.2 billion, compared to the consensus of $66.2 billion.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 64 hedge funds were long American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), compared to 74 funds in the earlier quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 151.6 million shares worth $28.4 billion.\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):\n\n“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.”\n\n9. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 98\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Animal Health.

(NYSE:MRK) was part of 98 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 85 in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.”\n\n8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a leading manufacturer and provider of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 31 million shares worth $3.2 billion.\n\nBaron Emerging Markets Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed in the fourth quarter due to investor expectations for a cyclical recovery in semiconductors heading into 2024 and significant incremental demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT, will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”\n\n7.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nJackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy. On February 1, the company announced financial results for its fiscal 2024 first quarter ended December 30, 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 131 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 134 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.5 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nHorizon Kinetics stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The full point is that if BYD has turned its attention from its domestic market to direct global competition, then other Chinese companies can do the same. The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro. This came as a great surprise – perhaps even shock – to the U.S. technology community, because four years ago the U.S. placed strict sanctions on China’s access to state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing technology…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Remote Jobs That Pay at Least $50 an Hour 13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to Avoid Jim Cramer’s 10 New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best Stocks To Buy and Hold Forever is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is being supercharged by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWith the exception of Apple and Tesla, each of these AI stocks has handily beaten the S&P 500 over the last year. Nvidia stands out in a league of its own, however.\n\nThe stock is up nearly 260% in the last year, and the company has added a trillion dollars of market cap in less than 12 months. With such a meteoric rise, investors may be thinking that they've missed the boat.\n\nLet's dig into the current state of Nvidia's business and, more importantly, take a look at what catalysts could be in store for future growth. Now could be as good a time as ever to begin building a position in this monster AI stock.\n\nWhat goes up must come down, right?\n\nNvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPU) that are used across an array of generative AI applications, including accelerated computing and machine learning. Demand for the company's flagship A100 and H100 chips is staggering, and it doesn't seem to be slowing down.\n\nNvidia recently reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2024, which ended Jan. 28. For the full year, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue -- up 126% year over year. But what's even more encouraging is the company's margin expansion and profitability growth.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Nvidia's gross margin was 72.7% -- an increase of nearly 16 percentage points over the prior year. On top of that, the company's free cash flow of $27 billion surged sixfold year over year.\n\nWith a financial performance like this, the music eventually has to stop, right? I wouldn't bank on that just yet. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia could just be getting started\n\nDespite Nvidia's record growth last year, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that the ride could just be getting started. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNvidia is expected to increase its top line by roughly 78% this year, followed by modest growth over the next couple of years. Admittedly, forecasting beyond one year can be more of an art than a science. As an investor, I'm not placing too much credence on estimates beyond fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the reasons I'm suspicious that the estimates above could be conservative is that investors are now just learning about some intriguing new catalysts. For starters, news broke a couple of weeks ago that Nvidia is an investor in voice-recognition software companySoundHound AI.\n\nThe terms of the partnership are not entirely known. However, Nvidia is just the latest big tech company to explore AI-powered voice assistants. Cohorts including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all invested significantly in similar technology -- thereby signaling that voice recognition could be a lucrative pocket of the overall AI landscape.\n\nIn addition, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Nvidia also has a budding enterprise software business. While it's still early innings for Nvidia on the software front, I see many reasons to be optimistic about this endeavor. Namely, it shows that the company is already expanding beyond semiconductor chips.\n\nMoreover, software tends to carry much higher margins than hardware development. Given that competition in semiconductor manufacturing will likely rise over the next few years, I wouldn't be surprised to see some margin deterioration, as Nvidia will likely lose some of its pricing power.\n\nNevertheless, it appears the company is already looking to outmaneuver such a dynamic by complementing its core data center operation with a software component.\n\nIs it too late to invest in Nvidia?\n\nDuring fourth-quarter earnings, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement when he declared that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" On the surface, you might think this means Nvidia's rocket ship may be returning from orbit. But that's not the case.\n\nRather, Huang went on to explain his philosophy in further detail. He believes that the installed base for data center infrastructure could double within the next five years. Given Nvidia's commanding position in this market, combined with the catalysts outlined above, investors have several reasons to believe that there could be substantial upside in Nvidia stock.\n\nHans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities recently slapped a $1,400 price target on Nvidia stock -- implying roughly 60% upside from current trading levels. Whether or not Nvidia reaches this price, the bigger picture remains.\n\nAll things considered, secular trends fueling spend in artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to not only stay but actually rise significantly over the next several years. Given Nvidia's unique position across both hardware and software, coupled with an increasing number of use cases and applications, I see Nvidia's growth journey as just beginning.\n\nNow could be an interesting time to begin using dollar-cost averaging to build a position or add to an existing holding in Nvidia stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "15 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market comes in all flavors and sizes. Typically, most investors focus on a firm's fundamentals, i.e. its income statement and balance sheet. So for instance, if a company's top and bottom line income grows significantly, then its shares also witness a corresponding increase in valuation. We don't have to look for this principle as the artificial intelligence stock NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s successive earnings reports have demonstrated triple digit growth on several fronts and its shares are at all time high levels.\n\nAnother investing approach is looking at the technical indicators to determine if any favorable market 'winds' are blowing to allow the investor to align their sails for smooth trading. These indicators include historic share price averages, the volume of shares traded, and metrics that determine if a stock is overbought or oversold. Another such indicator is seasonality, which checks to see if any stock market sectors deliver returns by the season.\n\nWhen we talk about seasonality, then since spring has just started, it's best to see which Spring stocks are seeing interest from hedge funds. But before that, a look to see which stock market sectors perform well in spring. On this front, some research from CNBC and StockCharts can help guide us. Since the latter segregates stock indexes by their monthly performance, it makes sense to start our brief look at spring stock market performance by starting from it.\n\nTaking a look at the flagship S&P 500, the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite, and the NYSE Primary, then the first three months of spring offer strong returns across all of these. Considering data for the twelve months of the year between 2005 to 2024, the S&P 500 closed higher in April 84% of the time - the highest for any month during the year. This is also the case for the NYSE's performance, with the same percentage for the same month.\n\nFinally, when we look at how stocks on the NASDAQ Composite perform during spring months, then March and April saw the index close higher 68% of the time, each - for the second highest figure after its performance during July and November. Finally, spring's a good time for stocks especially when we consider that for the S&P and NYSE, May offers the third highest odds for a higher monthly close. Performance in May is particularly interesting when we remember a stock market 'proverb' that calls on investors to 'Sell in May and Go Away', referring to portfolio adjustments before the holidays. Combining this with the data, perhaps one reason why stocks do well in May is due to low liquidity also affecting prices through volatility.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next step in our analysis of the best spring stocks is to see which sectors perform well. On this front, CNBC did some research and determined that the best spring stocks often include companies that operate in the financial services and energy industry. To quote the publication:\n\nCNBC.com looked at stock performance over the past ten years and calculated the highest average gains during the spring months of March, April and May. Of all the stocks to achieve a gain of 20 percent or more, 27 percent were in the financial sector, while 21 percent were energy-oriented.\n\nSo, how are these sectors doing right now? Well, the finance industry remains one of the most dynamic ones in the market. Banks were given a scare earlier this year after the shares of New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) dropped after it reported a surprise loss for the fourth quarter and made allocations for potential turmoil in the commercial real estate industry. The real estate sector's troubles have been exacerbated by record high interest rates, which also led to the fall of several U.S. banks during last year's regional banking crisis in the U.S.\n\nSo, with spring with us, we decided to take a look at some top spring stocks to buy. 15 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best spring stocks, we picked out the financial services and energy stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors during Q4 2023.\n\nFor these best spring stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15 Best Spring Stocks To Buy Now\n\n15.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best AI to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the artificial intelligence industry, head over to 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, artificial intelligence drove numerous technological advancements, with automation and machine learning expected to further enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Larger companies were twice as likely to utilize AI in 2022, and 80% of retail executives plan to implement AI-driven automation by 2025. Despite a projected 38% growth in the AI market in 2023, skepticism exists among tech enthusiasts for AI's growth in 2024. Some experts cite the expensive nature of generative AI creation, coupled with chip shortages, as potential challenges. While there are concerns about an \"AI cold shower,\" it is considered a myth, and extensive investments in AI continue despite uncertainties. 2024 is anticipated to be a crucial year for AI, with researchers and enterprises exploring practical integration into daily life. The evolution of generative AI parallels that of computers, progressing from large mainframes to smaller, more efficient machines. 2023 saw the rise of efficient open-source foundation models, like Meta's LlaMa, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. These models, with fine-tuning techniques, rival proprietary ones in performance despite smaller parameter counts.\n\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report predicts that the generative AI market will experience explosive growth, reaching $1.3 trillion over the next decade from $40 billion in 2022. The estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is 42%, driven initially by training infrastructure and later shifting to inference devices for large language models, digital ads, specialized software, and services. The rising demand for generative AI products could generate around $280 billion in new software revenue, benefiting companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as enterprises transition more workloads to the public cloud. Bloomberg Intelligence expects generative AI to represent 10% of total spending on IT hardware, software services, ad spending, and gaming markets by 2032, with significant revenue drivers including infrastructure-as-a-service, digital ads, and specialized AI assistant software. The life sciences and education sectors are highlighted as potential beneficiaries of generative AI, particularly in areas like specialized AI-based software assistants that could transform search and information summarization in these segments. Mandeep Singh, Senior Technology Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and lead author of the BI report commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“The world is poised to see an explosion of growth in the generative AI sector over the next ten years that promises to fundamentally change the way the technology sector operates. The technology is set to become an increasingly essential part of IT spendig, ad spending, and cybersecurity as it develops”.\n\nOn February 26, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in the significance of artificial intelligence, stating that it is not just a passing trend and extends beyond large language models like ChatGPT. Dimon compared the current state of AI to the tech bubble around the turn of the century, emphasizing the substantial impact AI is expected to have. JPMorgan has internally explored the use of these technologies, with Dimon foreseeing AI playing a role in almost every job. JPMorgan has dedicated resources, including a chief data and analytics officer, for AI-related initiatives, with around 200 employees actively researching large language models. Dimon, while acknowledging potential misuse, expressed optimism about AI's positive contributions, citing cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research as areas where it can be particularly beneficial.\n\nSome of the best AI ETFs offer investors exposure to stocks like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NYSE:S) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity software company that specializes in endpoint protection, cloud security, and security data analytics. Shares rose on outstanding quarterly financial results and strong guidance. SentinelOne is one of the fastest growing public cybersecurity companies, with revenue expected to grow more than 46% this fiscal year. Growth has been driven by a combination of: 1) market share capture from legacy endpoint vendors that struggle to compete against SentinelOne’s AI-enabled platform; 2) an ongoing shift of Information Technology (IT) infrastructure to the cloud driving demand for cloud application protection (growing triple digits); and 3) cybersecurity vendor consolidation favoring end-to-end platforms with comprehensive security portfolios over single-point solutions. The company is also leveraging its single data store and AI capabilities to cross-sell more products into its existing customer base and increase average sale prices. Between larger deal sizes and improving operating efficiencies, we believe the company can continue to expand margins at a significant rate and begin generating positive free cash flow in the next fiscal year.”\n\n11.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in gray) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch. One outlier right now is Nvidia which is capturing 80% margins..” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10.

The next most visible example of Chinese commercially applied technological prowess relates to the 2nd highest-weight company in the S&P 500, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIn September 2023, Huawei Technologies introduced its Mate 60 Pro smartphone. It uses its own, internally developed 5G enabled chip that is apparently competitive with the Apple A17 chip. For practical purposes it has the functionality of the iPhone 15 Pro.

AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you’re scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you’re glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here’s where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in – finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked – thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform.

Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Best Performing Growth Stocks in January & February 2024 12 Best American Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Engineering Stocks to Buy For 2024\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best AI ETFs To Invest In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "While Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) AI-fueled rally may not be over, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify buying the stock as the GPU maker's valuation soars. With a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion as of midday Wednesday, the stock requires investors to ignore the myriad threats that could unravel the company's dominance of the AI chip market.\n\nThe biggest advantage Nvidia has comes from software. CUDA is Nvidia's software toolkit for developing applications that can be accelerated by its GPUs. CUDA has been around for 16 years and has become the de facto standard. As the AI boom got underway, the path of least resistance was Nvidia GPUs and CUDA-powered software.\n\nWhile there are alternatives to CUDA, there's a tremendous amount of inertia keeping Nvidia's dominance intact. Without this software advantage, competing AI chips from AMD, Intel, and others would be having an easier time winning market share.\n\nNvidia recently updated its end-user license agreement for CUDA to explicitly disallow translation layers that enable CUDA-based software to run on non-Nvidia hardware. The company is clearly worried about competition chipping away at its dominant market position. The end of CUDA's dominance would be a boon for any company that buys AI accelerators, and it's likely to happen sooner or later as AI companies seek alternatives.\n\nA low-risk way to bet on AI\n\nWhile Nvidia's competitive advantages will likely erode over time as competition heats up, International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is positioning itself to be the go-to platform for AI among large enterprises and organizations. The company's watsonx AI platform, which gets its name from the Watson AI supercomputer that won Jeopardy! in 2011, is aimed at the type of customers that can't throw caution to the wind as they adopt AI technology.\n\nThe watsonx platform enables enterprises to train, validate, and deploy AI models while keeping an eye on compliance, risk management, and governance issues. Companies that operate in highly regulated industries must follow strict rules regarding their data, and no company wants a customer-facing AI chatbot to go off the rails. IBM's watsonx platform provides guardrails for enterprises deploying AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond general use cases, watsonx has some specific capabilities that can drive adoption. IBM's mainframe systems, which have been at the heart of some industries for decades, run billions of lines of sensitive, mission-critical code written in an ancient programming language called COBOL. As the number of developers capable of writing and maintaining COBOL code declines, IBM's mainframe customers are put in a bind.\n\nThis is where the watsonx Code Assistant comes into play. One application for this product is modernizing COBOL code by transforming it into Java code. This process must be done with care because much of this code is highly sensitive -- think software that processes transactions at major financial institutions. This functionality will not only drive customers to adopt the watsonx platform but also strengthen the mainframe business by making it much easier to modernize applications.\n\nStill a bargain stock\n\nIBM stock has rallied over the past year, gaining about 50% in that time. Optimism about the company's AI prospects along with a string of solid results are the likely culprits behind the surge.\n\nEven as IBM stock closes in on its all-time high, the stock remains a great value for investors. The company expects to generate free cash flow of about $12 billion this year, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at 15. For comparison, other large tech companies trade at significantly higher multiples of free cash flow. IBM Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAI is just a piece of what IBM does, but it's likely to be a key growth driver in the years ahead. The stock isn't nearly as cheap as it once was, but it's still an attractive investment for those looking to tap into the AI boom without taking on excessive levels of risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar in 2024: Here Are My Top 5 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Since stocks began trading on the Nasdaq roughly 50 years ago, the index has only produced negative annual returns 14 times. Over the last 20 years, the index has dropped by at least 30% on three occasions: 2002, 2008, and 2022.\n\nInterestingly, following the precipitous declines of 2002 and 2008, the Nasdaq rallied for consecutive years thereafter. Between 2003 and 2007, the Nasdaq returned an average of 16% per year. And in 2009 and 2010, the index produced average returns of 30%.\n\nAfter its painful performance in 2022, the Nasdaq rebounded sharply in 2023, returning 43%. It's safe to say that the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) largely influenced the upswing in tech stocks.\n\nBut 2024 is off to a red-hot start, and further gains could be in store for investors. While each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks below experienced AI-driven momentum last year, I think all of them still look enticing at the moment.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is best known for its e-commerce and cloud computing operations. The last few years have been brutal for Amazon. Unusually high inflation coupled with the rising interest rates that reined in that inflation have squeezed Amazon's core businesses. Consumers have scaled back their discretionary spending, putting a strain on Amazon's e-commerce efforts. In addition, as companies tightened their budgets, its software businesses witnessed a pronounced growth deceleration. This dynamic can be seen in the ebbs and flows of Amazon's revenue and free cash flow generation below. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut throughout 2023, Amazon made a series of savvy moves that could help reignite its growth. Among them, the company invested billions into OpenAI competitor Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will be training future generative AI models on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nInvestors should not overlook the impact AI can have on Amazon. The technology should not only help fuel some renewed interest in AWS, but also integrate into Amazon's e-commerce, streaming, logistics, and advertising businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.1 looks like a bargain compared to its historical levels. Now could be a great opportunity to scoop up shares of this under-the-radar AI player.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) kicked off the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. Since pouring billions into the start-up, Microsoft has swiftly integrated ChatGPT across the Windows operating system.\n\nSimilar to Amazon, Microsoft's Azure cloud platform carries some of the most lucrative growth prospects for the company as it relates to AI. The one concern I have about Microsoft is its valuation. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35.5, Microsoft trades at a premium compared to most of its Magnificent Seven peers. While it's reasonable to believe that the expected impacts of AI are baked into Microsoft's price, perhaps more than some of its peers, I don't think the stock is egregiously overvalued.\n\nClearly, investors are placing a premium on the biggest names in AI -- and Microsoft is no exception. Given that AI is in its early innings, I see Microsoft as well-positioned to dominate in the long run. Despite its premium valuation, now could still be a good time to use dollar-cost averaging to add some shares to your portfolio.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) owns two of the world's most visited websites: Google and YouTube. Given Alphabet's commanding surface area on the Internet, it's not a surprise to learn that advertisers are keen to be seen on its platforms.\n\nBut although advertising has long been Alphabet's primary revenue and profit machine, the company is in the midst of an identity crisis. Social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook have become increasingly popular over the last few years -- especially among highly coveted demographics, including Gen Z and millennials.\n\nAs such, growth in Alphabet's advertising business has started to plateau, investor enthusiasm is starting to wane, and Alphabet stock is taking a hit. On a price-to-sales basis, Alphabet is the second cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nNevertheless, I still see many reasons to own Alphabet stock. First, the company is quickly gaining momentum in the cloud computing landscape. What's even better is that its cloud segment is generating positive operating income on a consistent basis, mitigating some of the deceleration in the core advertising business.\n\nMoreover, the cloud is really where Alphabet is focusing its artificial intelligence efforts. So, even though the advertising business is currently facing some challenges, investors can actually buy Alphabet's AI business at a pretty steep discount.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) owns social media apps Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Additionally, the company has a budding metaverse operation via its virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) hardware products.\n\nThe last couple of years have been tough for Meta, however. The company pivoted to an all-in approach to the metaverse a couple of years ago. While this was initially met with praise, investors quickly soured on the company after a series of poor earnings reports that featured decelerating growth in the core advertising business and mounting losses.\n\nMeta spent much of 2023 turning things around and shifting its focus back to its bread-and-butter businesses. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith sales and free cash flow on the rise, Meta appears to have climbed its way out of a hole. What's even better is that in the wake of this newfound growth, Meta has found ample ways to reward shareholders. Following its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier this year, Meta announced a $50 billion share repurchase and the initiation of a quarterly dividend.\n\nGiven that artificial intelligence can significantly impact both Meta's advertising and metaverse businesses, the long-term ride could just be getting started for the social media conglomerate.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nLast on the list is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a developer of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Make no mistake about it -- the AI narrative largely hinges on Nvidia. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are in high demand as generative AI takes the world by storm.\n\nThe most lucrative thing about Nvidia is that AI touches nearly every aspect of its business -- from data centers to software development and more. What I find most attractive about Nvidia is that it's aggressively deploying its ever-growing profits. The company recently invested in two budding areas of AI: voice-recognition software and robotics. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nWhile the company's market cap has grown by $1 trillion in less than a year, I think the momentum can easily continue. Considering that its outlook is robust for the next several years, Nvidia's valuation seems warranted. Now could be a great time to buy some shares to hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: AMD vs. Nvidia",
        "content": "Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) that kicked off last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology, leading countless tech companies to pivot their businesses toward the high-growth sector.\n\nAs a result, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which will see it hit just under $2 trillion. The industry is expanding at a rapid pace, making it one of the best places to make a long-term investment.\n\nTwo stocks currently leading the way in AI are Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), with their shares recently up 149% and 257% respectively year over year. As prominent chipmakers, these companies supply the hardware necessary to train and run AI models. Their stocks could soar further in the coming years as the market develops.\n\nSo, let's compare these companies' businesses and determine whether AMD or Nvidia is the better AI stock this March.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAMD was slightly overshadowed by Nvidia's head start in AI chips last year, as Nvidia seized an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nHowever, the massive potential of the industry suggests AMD won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still see major gains from AI. So, despite spending years prioritizing its position in central processing units (CPUs), AMD has shifted its focus to developing its GPU technology and expanding in the budding AI market.\n\nLast December, the company unveiled its MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players.\n\nIn November 2023, Microsoft announced that Azure would become the first cloud platform to use AMD's MI300X to optimize AI capabilities. Microsoft has a close partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, making the company a powerful ally for AMD. An agreement with Meta -- which aims to use the new chips as well -- also helps AMD's future in AI look bright.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by investing in AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia captivated Wall Street over the last year as its chips became the gold standard for AI developers everywhere.\n\nSoaring demand for AI GPUs enabled Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket. In the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily from a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales.\n\nIn addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion.\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from its competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\nNvidia has a powerful position in AI that looks unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. Its market cap surpassed $2 trillion this year thanks to its massive success in AI. AMD's market cap is significantly lower at about $327 billion. However, that could mean AMD has more room to run over the long term as the company is still in the early stages of its AI journey.\n\nIs AMD or Nvidia the better AI stock?\n\nAI can potentially boost countless industries, from cloud computing to consumer products, autonomous vehicles, video games, and more. With so many sectors prioritizing generative technology, chip demand is only likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs a result, AMD and Nvidia are two exciting options to invest in AI. However, earnings per share (EPS) estimates indicate AMD might have more growth potential in the near term. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows AMD's earnings could hit just over $7 per share in the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's may reach $34 per share. On the surface, Nvidia looks like the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (AMD's 56 and Nvidia's 35) yields stock prices of $403 for AMD and $1,197 for Nvidia.\n\nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see AMD's stock rise 99% and Nvidia's 41% by fiscal 2026.\n\nAlongside heavy investment in AI and potentially more room to run, AMD is the better AI stock over Nvidia and a screaming buy this month.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "SOXX vs. FTXL: Not All Semiconductor ETFs Are the Same",
        "content": "Semiconductor ETFs are generating scorching returns as stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reach new heights. However, not all semiconductor ETFs are the same. Two funds can both focus on semiconductors, but there may be vast differences in the types of semiconductor stocks they hold, the weightings of these stocks within their portfolios, their returns over time, fees, and more that investors must take into account.\n\nLet’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:FTXL). They both invest in the space but take different approaches and have generated different returns over time. I’m bullish on both ETFs, but one is the superior choice based on several factors that we’ll evaluate in this article.\n\nWhat Is the SOXX ETF’s Strategy?\n\nSOXX is an index ETF from BlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) iShares that, according to the fund, gives investors “exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute semiconductors” by investing in “an index composed of U.S.-listed equities in the semiconductor sector.” SOXX essentially invests in the 30 largest U.S. stocks classified as semiconductor companies by ICE.\n\nSOXX launched in 2001 and has $12.8 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nWhat Is the FTXL ETF’s Strategy?\n\nMeanwhile, FTXL invests in an index called the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index. First Trust describes this index as a “modified factor weighted index created and administered by Nasdaq, Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ). designed to provide exposure to US companies within the semiconductor industry.”\n\nThe stocks within this index are ranked based on three factors; their trailing 12-month return on assets, trailing 12-month gross income, and momentum based on their three-, six-, nine-, and 12-month price appreciation.\n\nThe lowest-scoring 25% of stocks from this universe based on these scores are then eliminated from the index, leaving it with a remaining group of 30-50 stocks that FTXL can potentially invest in. These remaining stocks are weighted based on their trailing 12-month cash flow and can have a weighting of up to 8% and a minimum of 0.50%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe index is then reconstituted and rebalanced on a semiannual basis. As we’ll discuss below, these different approaches create two portfolios that have some overlap but also some key differences.\n\nHow Do Their Portfolios Compare?\n\nSOXX owns 30 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 61.7% of the fund. Below is an overview of SOXX’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nMeanwhile, FTXL owns 32 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 65.9% of holdings, so the two funds are very similar when it comes to diversification. Below is an overview of FTXL’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, SOXX has large positions with double-digit weightings in its top two holdings, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). These large positions have served SOXX well, as Nvidia is up 283.4% over the past year, while Advanced Micro Devices is up 147.6%.\n\nAt the same time, FTXL has a large 9.2% position in its top holding, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). This stock has generated a 44.5% gain over the past year, which is great but is behind the astronomical returns of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Note that FTXL owns these stocks, too, but at smaller weightings of 5.7% and 6.1%, respectively.\n\nBoth funds have large positions in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), another major winner in the chip space, which has gained 127.6% over the past year.\n\nTipRanks’ Smart Score system gives a resounding nine of SOXX’s top 10 holdings Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher, and it gives eight of FTXL’s top 10 holdings Smart Scores of 8 or higher. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nBoth ETFs receive Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Scores of 8. These are both strong portfolios but Smart Score rates SOXX’s top holdings a bit more favorably, and SOXX’s top holdings have helped it outperform FTXL, as we’ll get to in the next section.\n\nHead-to-Head Performance\n\nWhen it comes to performance, these two ETFs have been long-term winners. As of February 29, FTXL has generated an impressive three-year annualized return of 11.8% and a five-year return of 24.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, as of the same date, SOXX has generated an even more impressive three-year annualized return of 17.2% and a stunning five-year annualized return of 30.3%.\n\nFTXL launched in 2016, so we can’t yet compare the two ETFs on a 10-year timeframe, but SOXX’s 10-year return of 25.3% over the past decade is excellent.\n\nFTXL’s returns are good, but SOXX’s are even better, and it has a longer track record of excellence, giving SOXX a clear edge in this category. Both ETFs have sound strategies, but it seems that SOXX’s strategy of simply investing in the largest 30 U.S. semiconductor equities has generated a stronger performance than FTXL’s more nuanced strategy over time.\n\nIs SOXX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SOXX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SOXX stock price target of $671.72 implies 191% upside potential from current levels.\n\nIs FTXL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FTXL earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average FTXL stock price target of $90.59 implies 2% downside potential from current levels.\n\nCost Comparison\n\nIn terms of fees, SOXX’s expense ratio of 0.35% is a better bargain than FTXL’s expense ratio of 0.60%. An investor putting $10,000 into SOXX will pay $35 in annual fees, while an investor putting $10,000 into FTXL will pay $60.\n\nThe differences in these fees compound and become more apparent over time. For example, assuming each ETF returns 5% per year from here, the investor putting $10,000 into SOXX will pay $443 in fees over the next 10 years, while the investor putting the same amount into FTXL will pay $750.\n\nAdding It All Up\n\nThese are both good ETFs that invest in strong stocks, and they have generated sizable returns for investors. However, the returns that SOXX has generated are substantially better than those of FTXL, and it charges significantly less in fees, making SOXX the clear winner here. Furthermore, TipRanks’ Smart Score system has a slightly more favorable outlook on SOXX’s top holdings, and analysts also see SOXX as having more potential upside, adding to SOXX’s edge.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) started the current artificial intelligence boom. Its name alone can bring up smaller AI companies. Investors witnessed this firsthand as AI stocks within Nvidia’s portfolio skyrocketed.\n\nThe logic for investors was simple. The company must be a solid pick if Nvidia invests in an AI stock. While investors should do more research into those stocks instead of buying them just because Nvidia did, some AI stocks have great promise.\n\nThese are some of the AI stocks Nvidia should buy next. Investors can get a head start instead of waiting for the tech conglomerate to make a move.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia may want to start its search with a company that it recently surpassed. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has made several missteps in the artificial intelligence race, but those blunders have created a buying opportunity.\n\nThe stock trades at a 25 P/E ratio, up 142% over the past five years. The recent pullback indicates investors are ignoring the vast potential of the company’s advertising network and cloud platform.\n\nWhile the underlying business is enough to generate more gains, Alphabet is still heavily invested in artificial intelligence. The company has time to right the ship, and the current valuation offers a good margin of safety. Alphabet’s financials are strong based on the company’s fourth-quarter results.\n\nDuring that quarter, revenue increased by 13% year-over-year while net income increased by 52% year-over-year. During the press release, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that Google Search, YouTube and Cloud benefit from the company’s AI investments. Alphabet will get over the bumps in the road and still has an excellent business model.\n\nCadence Design Systems (CDNS) A Cadence corporate office building has a sign with the company logo out front\n\nSource: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) has steadily outperformed the market. Shares are up by 64% over the past year and have gained 433% over the past five years. The company is harnessing generative AI to transform product design and recently announced the first generative AI technology that automatically identifies and addresses EM-IR violations. The technology helps make the product design process more efficient.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s fourth-quarter results indicate a rising market share. Cadence generated $1.069 billion in revenue compared to $900 million in Q4 2022. That’s an 18.8% year-over-year increase. Net income increased by 34.7% year-over-year, which resulted in a 30.3% net profit margin.\n\nThe company has exposure to artificial intelligence and is releasing its own solutions. Meanwhile, it has healthy, growing financials with plenty of runways. Shares currently trade at a 51.5 forward P/E ratio. The stock is up by 20% year-to-date and AI tailwinds can bring it higher.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has enjoyed a resurgence. The stock has more than tripled over the past year as the company reports solid growth and profit margin expansion.\n\nPalantir’s big data analytics use artificial intelligence to offer a better user experience. The company has won many government contracts and recently expanded to private businesses.\n\nThe combination of government and private business clients worked well for the company. Palantir achieved GAAP profitability for the 5th consecutive quarter. That wasn’t the only highlight from the Q4 2023 earnings report. Revenue increased by 19.6% year-over-year while net income more than tripled year-over-year.\n\nCustomer count grew by 35% year-over-year, largely fueled by private businesses. Government revenue grew by 11% year-over-year, while U.S. commercial revenue increased by 70% year-over-year. A growing customer base and top-tier software can help Palantir march higher.\n\nShares trade at a 79 forward P/E ratio, which may be high for some value investors. However, Nvidia hasn’t shown much preference for buying stocks based on their valuations so this pick would make sense for the company’s portfolio.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is headed toward the biggest one-day drop in seven months as traders take profits following a rally that saw the stock gain more than 19% in six consecutive trading days.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHuawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear Suppliers Chemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Nasdaq 100 Falls 1% as Stock Rally Hits a Wall: Markets Wrap TSMC to Win More Than $5 Billion in Grants for US Chip Plant China Readies $27 Billion Chip Fund to Counter Growing US Curbs\n\nThe chipmaker’s shares were down 4.8% Friday, which if sustained would be the biggest decline since Aug. 2. In a sign of how far Nvidia has rallied this year, the relatively small drop at one point erased more than $140 billion in market value, which would rank among the biggest single-day value destructions in US stock market history.\n\nNvidia shares have soared this year amid rising optimism that demand for its chips used in artificial intelligence computing will remain robust. Even after Friday’s decline, the stock is up more than 70% in 2024. With a market value of $2.2 trillion, Nvidia is the third biggest company in the S&P 500 after Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nEarlier in the session, Nvidia shares gained as much as 5.1%, pushing a momentum indicator to the highest since November 2021, signaling the stock was ripe for a pullback.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Slashed His Position in Nvidia. Here Are the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "David Tepper amassed a fortune of $20.6 billion by making plenty of smart decisions. Some investors will probably question one of his recent decisions, though. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper sold nearly 23% of his Appaloosa Management hedge fund's position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIn retrospect, that doesn't appear to be a great move. Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed more than 70% so far in 2024. However, Tepper remains heavily invested in the GPU maker. Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding. He's also still very bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). Here are four AI stocks the billionaire investor bought in Q4.\n\n1. Oracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) ranks as Tepper's biggest new position in Q4. He bought 1.32 million shares of the database and software giant that were worth close to $140 million at the end of 2023.\n\nSince then, Oracle's shares have risen by a single-digit percentage. The company hasn't had any major news to provide a catalyst yet in 2024. That could soon change: Oracle is scheduled to announce its fiscal 2024 third-quarter results on March 11.\n\nIn the meantime, Oracle has been busy bolstering its AI credentials. The company launched its new Oracle cloud infrastructure generative AI service in January. This new service enables Oracle's cloud platform customers to build generative AI apps using large language models from Cohere and Meta Platforms. Oracle is also a major partner with Nvidia's DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service.\n\n2. Alibaba\n\nTepper also loaded up on Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) in Q4. His hedge fund already owned a sizable position in the Chinese tech stock but added another 750,000 shares. That was enough to boost Appaloosa's stake in Alibaba by nearly 21%.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Tepper might like Alibaba right now. The stock is down more than 20% over the last 12 months due in large part to sluggish growth in China. This decline, though, has made Alibaba cheaper than it's been in quite a while with a forward earnings multiple of only 8.1 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba has reportedly placed big orders for Nvidia's chips to use with its cloud platform. However, it can't deploy the most advanced GPUs because of U.S. restrictions on exports of AI technology to China.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) retained its No. 3 spot in Appaloosa Management's portfolio at the end of 2023. But it was a bigger position for the hedge fund after Tepper increased his stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant by more than 5.3%. That has turned out to be a great move, with Amazon stock jumping by a double-digit percentage so far in 2024.\n\nWhy does Tepper like Amazon? I suspect two reasons especially stand out. First, the company's profitability and free cash flow are growing robustly. Second, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform should have tremendous growth prospects fueled by the adoption of generative AI.\n\nAs was the case with Oracle and Alibaba, Amazon also has a tight connection with Nvidia. AWS has used Nvidia's GPUs for years. But Amazon is also at least somewhat of a rival to Nvidia as well. The company has developed its own Trainium and Inferentia AI chips that AWS customers can use with their AI apps.\n\n4. Microsoft\n\nTepper also increased his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) by nearly 4% in Q4. The massive tech company currently ranks as Appaloosa Management's second-largest holding, making up 11.3% of its portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft has been another solid winner so far this year. AI continues to serve as a major growth driver for the company, which has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its products.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Microsoft is yet another key partner with Nvidia. Among other things, the two companies are working together to connect Nvidia's AI Enterprise software with Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning platform. Like Amazon, though, Microsoft has also developed its own AI chips that could help it reduce its dependence on Nvidia.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "The S&P 500 soared to new all-time highs on reassuring comments regarding potential interest rate declines. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen 8.3% so far this year.\r\n\r\nWe have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double digits so far this year. These are Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, Meta Platforms META, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Eli Lilly and Company LLY.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a U.S. Senate committee that the central bank is “not far\" from being confident that inflation is declining toward the 2% target, which would make rate cuts possible. The comment has bolstered investor expectations for the first rate cut in June.\r\n\r\nPowell noted that inflation had “eased substantially” since hitting a 40-year high in 2022 but that policymakers still needed “greater confidence” in its continued decline before cutting rates. He added that there are risks of keeping monetary policy tight for too long and damaging an ongoing economic expansion that has sustained a below 4% unemployment rate for two years.\r\n\r\nThe latest bouts of weak data have also raised the bets that the Fed might lower interest rates as soon as June. The U.S. manufacturing sector recorded its 16th consecutive month of decline in February, while Michigan University’s consumer confidence index dropped slightly last month. U.S. personal spending data also showed the weakest reading in three years. Traders now see a 72.7% chance of the first rate cut this year in June, per CME Group's FedWatch tool (read: Is US Manufacturing Space Improving? 4 Sector ETFs Look Decent).\r\n\r\nFurther, the European Central Bank might also start cutting rates as soon as June on a softer outlook for inflation and economic growth.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.\n\nSPY in Focus\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.\r\n\r\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $497.7 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 65 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium-risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).\r\n\r\nBelow, we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest-Performing Stocks of SPY\n\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 87% so far this year. It has an estimated growth of 79.2% for the fiscal year ending January 2025.\r\n\r\nNvidia makes up 5.1% of the assets in SPY and has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. It has a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nConstellation Energy generates and markets electricity. It sells natural gas, renewable energy and other energy-related products and services. The stock has jumped 53.6% so far this year. It makes up 0.13% of the assets in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nConstellation Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.7% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a Momentum Score of A (read: Nasdaq ETF Logs Best Month Since 2015: 5 Top Stocks).\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app due to acquisitions. The stock has jumped 44.7% and has an estimated earnings growth of 34.1% for this year.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms accounts for 2.6% of SPY's assets. It currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market. It has evolved from a pure-bred consumer-PC chip provider to an enterprise-focus company. The stock has rallied 43.4% so far this year and accounts for 0.79% of the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has an estimated earnings growth rate of 30.6% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies and boasts a diversified product profile, including a solid lineup of new successful drugs. The stock has gained 33.8% and accounts for a 1.4% share in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly has an estimated earnings growth rate of 96.8% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is nipping at the heels of Apple to become the world's second-most-valuable company, as investors cannot get enough of the semiconductor maker whose chips power popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.\n\nAn AI-induced jaw-dropping rally in Nvidia shares has taken the company's valuation from $1 trillion to more than $2 trillion in just nine months, overtaking Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco on the way.\n\nNvidia's market capitalization currently hovers around $2.38 trillion, lagging Apple by just about $230 billion and Microsoft by about $645 billion.\n\nThe relentless rise in shares of Nvidia, which controls 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has been instrumental in pushing Wall Street to record levels this year, while giving the company a more than 5% weightage on the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nNvidia, which is up 95%, and Meta Platforms, which is up 46.6% so far this year, have also outperformed shares of other members of the so-called Magnificient 7, highlighting investors' insatiable appetite for everything AI.\n\n\"Nvidia's rally reflects the incredibly strong fundamentals underlying its current business model,\" said Richard Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\"It is also finding strong speculative support as a favorite among long option buyers who have seen almost a straight upward climb throughout 2024.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Apple, which is grappling with slowing iPhone sales, ceded its position as the most valuable U.S. company to Microsoft for the first time since 2021 in January.\n\nIn recent weeks, Nvidia also replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.\n\nThe stock's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36.6 is lower than where it was a year ago despite the stock's strong run as analysts raised its profit estimates.\n\nBy comparison, Intel's PE multiple is 30.24 and that of Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index is 39.6, LSEG data showed.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Nvidia is in fact the cheapest of the \"AI narrative\" stocks out there,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.\n\n\"We continue to believe that in five years or 10 years we will all be talking about an industry that is far larger than the numbers being bandied about today.\"\n\nHowever, there are signs Nvidia stock is nearing a peak.\n\nOver the next 12 months, Wall Street analysts' median target price implies Nvidia would trade at $850 per share, below the last closing price of $926, LSEG data showed.\n\n\"Of course, it is very difficult for any mega-cap stock's price to continue to grow at this pace as the law of large numbers eventually comes into play. But the stock price could remain at these levels if the company can continue to meet or exceed the high expectations of analysts,\" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

Depending on either of these, one can pile money either into growth stocks or in value stocks.\n\nAs the title suggests, growth stocks belong to those companies that are expected to grow their revenue and profitability in the future. This translated into hefty share prices, and one key way in which investors determine whether a stock is a growth stock is its price to earnings ratio. This ratio divides the current share price with the earnings per share to see the premium that the market is paying over a stock's ability to earn money through EPS.\n\nNaturally, since their share prices are based on investor expectations instead of current financial performance, growth stocks are also riskier than value stocks. There are a couple of reasons behind this risk. The first is a sentiment driven share price driven by valuation models to an extent. While models such as discounted cash flows (DCF) provide a nice way to value a firm's future cash flows today, they still carry the risk of reality not matching the model and the shares adjusting to reflect this.\n\nAdditionally, growth isn't cheap and while we'll get to this later, since growth stocks rely on investor optimism about the future, they carry the risk of losing their value in case the economic clouds darken. A robust economy helped by consistent growth is a key determinant of growth stock performance, and this has also been the case throughout 2022 and 2023. The two years have proven to be among the most tumultuous in recent stock market history, and they've seen growth stocks tumble and then surge as a reflection of investor expectations for the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, one last important factor to keep in mind when looking at growth stocks is interest rates. These set the tone for the business climate, and for growth stocks, it means that they find it easier to finance their expansion if the rates are low. If you've been regularly following Insider Monkey or the financial media in general, you'd know that interest rates remain the hottest topic on Wall Street.\n\nOn this front, the tail end of February 2024 provided investors with a crucial data set to determine the future path of interest rates. Right now rates are quite high as the Federal Reserve is determined to stamp out inflation. Even as inflation remains above the Fed's benchmark, the fact that it has dropped noticeably over the past year or so has provided investors, and particularly those who like growth stocks, with hope that the first cuts will start soon.\n\nTherefore, with inflation tied to interest rates, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index data for January 2024 added to rate cut hopes. The data set from the Commerce Department revealed that during the month the PCE jumped by 0.3% and over the year, it stood at 2.4%. Both of these figures met market estimates, and consequently, the S&P 500 jumped by 26 basis points, while the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite (which includes some of the biggest growth stocks in the world) added 0.46% to its previous close.\n\nHowever, while the dark economic clouds take their sweet time to dissipate, a recent growth stock earnings report shows just how brutal smart money can be if its expectations are not met. This earnings report was for the Bozeman, Montana based cloud computing services provider Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and it saw the firm forecast its revenue for the current quarter to sit between $745 million and $750 million. This fell shy of the average analyst estimates of $765 million (according to Refinitiv), and the miss came as Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s management explained that economic uncertainty could drive its customers to reduce their spending. At the same time, the firm made a shocking announcement that revealed that its CEO Frank Slootman, who had joined in 2019 and led the firm to its current dominant role in the market, was retiring. Since such surprising announcements are rare for high growth stocks, investors reacted, and so far, Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)'s shares have bled 19% since its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top performing growth stocks in January and February.

        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development. If you want to skip our detailed analysis you can go directly to the 5 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development.\n\nGlobal R&D Outlook\n\nAccording to the R&D report by AAAS, global investments in research and development have witnessed a significant surge over the past 20 years. The global R&D investments tripled from $672 billion in 1992 to more than $2.2 trillion by 2021. However, the aftermath of the pandemic hindered this growth, with a decline in annual increases to less than 2% in 2020 and 2021, compared to 3.6% in the last decade. Although there are reporting limitations from China to quantify its data, it is evident that it is the largest contributor to non-OECD investments. OECD countries are continuously increasing their R&D spending. In 2021, the R&D investments by OECD countries reached 2.71%. The business sector is the key driver of these investments, accounting for over 60% of R&D investments in 2020. The R&D intensity of the US surpassed 3% in 2019 after ranging between 2.5% to 3% for over two decades. South Korea and China also experienced substantial growth over the past decade, with their R&D spending surging from 2.1% to 4.6% and from 0.9% to 2.2%, respectively. Germany's research and development spending also reached 3.2% in 2019.\n\nGlobal Tech Investments\n\nThe strong research and development portfolio of countries globally reflects directly on the pace of technological advancements in today's world. With the growing digital and tech adoption, the world is continuously advancing toward key technology trends such as AI, cloud computing, quantum science, and edge computing. The workforce in the tech sector is a major driver of the growth of the tech sector. Tech-related fields experienced a 15% rise between 2021 and 2022. Nearly 1 million job postings were publicized by applied AI and next-generation software development between 2018 and 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn March 5, Reuters reported that China outlined plans to strengthen its self-sufficiency in the tech sector. The country aims to focus on emerging trends such as quantum computing and AI. This plan is a result of the current trade tensions with the US. China will introduce major science and technology programs and utilize its political systems to integrate capabilities and reduce dependency on foreign suppliers. Moreover, it plans to develop a robust pool of researchers and innovators to fuel domestic advancements across various tech domains.\n\nSome of the most technologically advanced countries such as the US, China, and South Korea are also actively investing in AI. According to research from Bloomberg Intelligence, the global AI market is anticipated to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 42%. PwC estimates that AI could lead to a staggering contribution of $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Additionally, AI is expected to fuel an increase of 26% in the GDP of local economies by 2030. The United States is leading the ongoing AI  race with the highest number of AI startups. For instance, Anthropic is a leading AI startup in the US, backed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). On March 4, Reuters reported that the Silicon Valley startup, Anthropic released its latest suite of AI models, Claude 3. The model claims to outshine competitors such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Gemini 1.0 Ultra. The Claude 3 Opus will be ideal when dealing with complex tasks such as financial analysis.\n\nCompanies Driving Innovation in the Tech Sector\n\nSome of the top companies driving innovation in the tech sector include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nOn January 19, the global tech leader, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that AWS will be making a significant investment of 2.26 trillion yen into its cloud infrastructure in Japan by 2027. This investment will contribute to the rising demand for cloud services in the country and also add to Japan's digital transformation.  Moreover, the project will induce a positive economic impact, supporting jobs and fueling GDP.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading tech company, specializing in robotics, AI, HPC, and autonomous vehicle technology. On February 6, the company announced that it had allied with digital communications technology company, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to provide robust and manageable AI infrastructure solutions to businesses. The partnership aims to manage the growing demand for secure and efficient tools to deploy AI at scale. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will leverage Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) networking capabilities to offer a diverse suite of solutions. It will also integrate its GPUs into Cisco servers, granting access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. Moreover, Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CSCO) AI-assisted management and monitoring tools will facilitate infrastructure operations.\n\nOn February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched the next generation of its large language model, Gemini 1.5 with significant improvements compared to its predecessors. The new model will deliver improved performance and will have a novel MoE architecture enhancing its efficiency. The Gemini 1.5 will be capable of processing up to 1 million tokens. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has initially released the language model with a standard context window of 128,000 tokens, with restricted access to 1 million tokens through an early access program.\n\nNow, let's have a look at the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development. 20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development\n\n20 Countries that Spend the Most on Research and Development\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 countries that spend the most on research and development, we utilized the R&D Expenditure as a percentage of GDP data from the World Bank.

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the hottest industries, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nMost of the debate surrounding the stock market this year has focused on artificial intelligence stocks, and rightly so when we look at the 12 month share price performance of key players in the industry such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one sector that has been the most turbulent this year has been space.\n\nSince there is only handful of pure play space companies with beefy share prices or sufficient liquidity, space stocks generally do not receive as much media coverage as other sectors such as consumer technology and oil and gas. This is further bolstered by the fact that aerospace exploration has primarily been a government funded venture for most of its history. The Space Race of the 1970s, which culminated with the end of the Apollo program saw the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pay private companies to develop complex industrial equipment like a launch vehicle (commonly known as a rocket) or shuttles.\n\nOver the course of time since the end of the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle era, space stocks started to make their first moves. While these days private companies can rightfully claim to operate some of the most technologically advanced vehicles in the world, back then space stocks were limited to satellite companies. In fact, while it's still a NASA contractor and a space stock because of its rockets and crewed spacecraft, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BO) is also one of the first space stocks to trade on the market. This is because the course of Boeing's long history has also seen the U.S. aerospace giant acquire the space division of the now RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) owned American defense contractor The Hughes Company. Hughes' Syncom satellite was the first geosynchronous communications satellite sent into orbit. There's another decades old space stock on our list and you can find it as you scroll through.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis year, one space stock has made the news on the market and as well as in general press coverage. This stock belongs to the Houston, Texas based aerospace and defense firm Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR). Intuitive Machines's Nova C Odysseus lunar lander launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier in February 2024 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Before Odysseus, the privately held Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander had attempted to be the first U.S. Moon lander since the Apollo program, but the spacecraft failed soon after orbit.\n\nSo, hopes were high for Nova C, and since the lander is one of the few in the world that uses a methane powered rocket engine for its journey, it was slated to land on the Moon in just a week post launch. As the launch was successful and Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) confirmed that it had separated from the second stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in space, the space stock soared. It jumped from $4.98 on the day of the launch to touch nearly $11 over the course of the next few trading days. The jump in Intuitive Machines' share price underscored the potential of successful space missions and untapped investor eagerness to buy space stocks.\n\nHowever, this rise to glory would prove to be short lived and truly underscore the fragility of space exploration - one of the riskiest endeavors in the world. In a press conference after the lander touched down, Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR)'s management shared that oversight during final checkouts meant that Odysseus's landing sensors would not be online for landing. Consequently, engineers had to jerry rig a NASA payload on the lander to provide it with guidance, a procedure that led to (but might not have exclusively contributed to) the lander tipping over during landing. Instantly, the stock dropped by 30% in the aftermarket, and on the day the markets opened after the weekend, the shares reversed almost all price gains made post launch. Will hedge funds continue to hold Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) stock after the lunar lander oversight? You can check in next quarter to find out.\n\nWith this chilling example demonstrating the fragility of investing in space stocks, we nevertheless decided to see what the hedge funds were doing. Some of their top space stocks as of December 2023 are Telesat Corporation (NASDAQ:TSAT), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). 12 Best Space Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nA close-up of an antenna, its intricate designs a testament to the company's expertise in space infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best space stocks, we ranked all publicly traded firms that either directly operate in the space industry or are major contributors to exploration efforts and the satellite industry by the number of hedge funds that had bought the stocks as of Q4 2023 end.\n\nFor these best space stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best hot stocks to buy for March. If you want to skip our overview of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Hot Stocks to Buy For March.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is dominated by one key theme. If you haven't been following us regularly, then you'd have missed out on the fact that artificial intelligence, powered by the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the key factor on investors' minds when they look at major indexes such as the S&P 500 and the tech focused NASDAQ Composite. No one can blame them for this either, as after inflation and interest rates set records, 2024 has also been a record setting year for the stock market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence fueled mania, exacerbated by the earnings season in January that confirmed to investors that the demand for AI products was real and not just hype has pushed the S&P 500 index to cross the coveted 5,000 point mark for the first time in history. This comes after the NASDAQ's record setting spree last year and follows the second half of 2023 that had seen investors wonder whether the soaring S&P 500 in H1 2023 would continue its upward trajectory in the second half.\n\nThis surge in the stock market, even as the Federal Reserve remains worried about inflation, has made NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world and made it surpass the market volumes big ticket mega cap names the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The two are worth $1.8 trillion and $1.7 trillion, respectively, while NVIDIA's 64% rise year to date fueled by the firm's latest earnings release means that its latest market capitalization now sits at $1.97 trillion with trailing and forward price to earnings ratios of 66 and 33, respectively.\n\nYet, even though NVIDIA's shares take off and have no signs of looking back, the broader macroeconomic trends that shaped the stock market discourse in 2022 and 2023 are nevertheless still in play. Interest rates are still too high to be considered easy for business, and most investors expect that the first cuts will come in June - a percentage that increases for a July cut. The last week of February is also quite important because of the data that will become available. This will come in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index reading for January. The PCE is one of the most important data to judge the Fed's future actions since it is the central bank's preferred inflation metric. If officials believe that inflation is on a sufficiently downward trend to not raise its head again after an interest rate cut, then rates might start dropping before June. Should investors also read this conclusion, then the stock market should do well after the PCE data for January 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we move forward to our latest collection of the best hot stocks to buy though, a recent report from the famed investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) merits a mention. Goldman was one of the few voices on Wall Street that bucked the trend in late 2022 and argued that avoiding a recession might be avoidable despite rapid central bank interest rate hikes. Now, the bank shares that during the week that ended on February 2023, hedge funds sold technology stocks at some of the highest rates for the past five years. It believes that software stocks were among the biggest losers, while bullish bets such as call options for NVIDIA's shares remain in play and suggest a hesitancy to completely go against technology stocks.\n\nSo, with Q1 2024 shaping up to be quite interesting, we decided to take a look at some hot stocks to buy. A couple of these are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Uber Technologies, Inc.

        "title": "Nvidia Looks Primed for a Stock Split After $1 Trillion Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp’s scorching rally has added more than $1 trillion in value this year alone, sending it well above the level where it last split its shares. Some see the AI giant well placed to do so again.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Huawei Chip Breakthrough Used Tech From Two US Gear Suppliers How Trump’s Ex-Treasury Chief Landed 2024's Highest-Profile US Bank Deal Stocks Climb on Bets Fed, ECB Closer to Rate Cuts: Markets Wrap Biden Orders Military to Build Port to Ease Gaza’s Hunger Crisis\n\nThe company last announced a four-for-one stock split in May 2021, when it was trading at about $600 per share. Today, the stock is nearing the $1,000 level, extending last year’s 240% surge. While bulls argue that its valuation based on future earnings growth is relatively cheap, some potential investors may balk at the price.\n\n“Probably in the next year or so, I expect the stock to split and that would be able to get some small retail investors into the stock where they think it’s out of reach right now,” said Ken Mahoney, president and chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management.\n\nThe reasoning Nvidia gave for 2021 split was “to make stock ownership more accessible to investors and employees,” according to a press release. It rallied to about $750 per share by July 19 that year — the day before it started trading on a split adjusted basis. After a 2022 drop, the shares have since blasted past those levels.\n\nStock splits are a cosmetic move generally enacted to attract smaller investors. The action reduces share price by redistributing the amount of equity over a larger number of stock, but doesn’t change anything about underlying fundamentals or valuation.\n\n“I’m always of two minds,” said Mike Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management LLC, adding that on one hand, stock splits don’t matter much because they don’t change anything about a company’s value.\n\nStory continues\n\n“But, on the other hand, retail investors psychologically do like to buy things that are $30 instead of $300,” he said. “They tell themselves that it’s less expensive even though it’s absolutely not less expensive.”\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia hasn’t made any indication that it would split its shares anytime soon, and with its rally still marching higher, it doesn’t seem to be scaring away all retail investors. Its one of the most-traded stocks for the retail crowd, alongside Tesla Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc., according to data from Vanda Research.\n\nAnd, investors that aren’t ready to pony up Thursday’s closing price of about $927 could still buy fractional shares of Nvidia, or hold fewer units.\n\nIn addition, no companies in the Nasdaq 100 split their stocks last year amid a market-leading tech rally. That was a reversal from just a few years earlier during the pandemic, when technology stocks soared and spurred splits in some of the largest companies.\n\nRead more: Nasdaq 100 Heads for First Year Since 2010 Without a Stock Split\n\nBoth Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. split their shares in 2020 — with the move being the EV maker’s second in a two-years span. Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. both split their stocks in 2022. Microsoft, however, hasn’t split its own shares since 2003, when it traded at about $50.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Consider the \"Terrific Trio.\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have been market leaders since 2023 but are not quite an artificial intelligence (AI)-focused group. While many within the cohort have AI products, they aren't pure plays.\n\nInstead, I'm proposing a new group of three that informs investors on how strong AI demand is. That group, consisting of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is also a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), gives investors a look at the hardware side of AI.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a basket of stocks to track AI infrastructure buildout, this \"Terrific Trio\" is the way to go.\n\nThis trio has their hands in most AI products\n\nStarting at the base, computing hardware requires semiconductor chips, and Taiwan Semiconductor produces the vast majority of them. To produce more powerful chips, manufacturers place the conductive traces closer together, which allows more components to be packed onto a board. To describe these chips, chip manufacturers name them based on how far apart the traces are. Currently, the smallest TSMC can go is 3 nanometers (nm), but it's already working on its 2 nm technology as well.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes chips for some of the world's biggest companies and is one of Nvidia's key suppliers.\n\nNvidia gets the most attention of this trio, as its parabolic rise since early 2023 resulted in the stock increasing nearly 500%. This excitement is due to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are best-in-class for training AI models. GPUs are built to process complex calculations like training AI models.\n\nBut what benefits Nvidia is the number of GPUs purchased when a supercomputer is built. These devices require thousands of GPUs to provide users with top-end computing power, and with the rumored price of an H100 GPU coming in at around $30,000 a piece, that generates a lot of revenue for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly is Super Micro Computer. Haphazardly assembling a few hundred or thousand GPUs together without the networking or architecture experience is a recipe for disaster. Many companies without the experience necessary to get the most out of their GPUs go to Supermicro to build their servers.\n\nWith Super Micro Computer's highly modular system, it can spec in a server of just about any size and focus that a client could want.\n\nTogether, these three offer a great pulse on the AI movement, as their products are essential table stakes for getting into the AI game. But they've each had a strong 2024, so is this a good trio to buy right now?\n\nThe trio has had a strong 2024\n\nThis group has been a fantastic one to own in 2024. Supermicro's led the charge, rising more than 280%. NVDA Chart\n\nAfter those numbers, many investors may be worried about overpaying for any of the stocks in this group. However, that argument breaks down if you examine the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (which uses analyst projections over the next 12 months). NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe forward P/E ratio is important when the company you're assessing is going through a massive transformation, like these three are due to AI demand. Additionally, when comparing this metric to a more typical price-to-earnings ratio (which uses trailing earnings to value the company), it's best to take a few points off because these are only projections.\n\nWith that in mind, it's clear that Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are still within the realm of buying, although Supermicro has gotten quite expensive. However, Nvidia's stock also traded for more than 50 times forward earnings in 2023, so Supermicro could grow into its valuation through sustained outsize growth.\n\nSo, should you buy the \"Terrific Trio?\" I'd say yes if you want an absolute pulse on the AI market. But, if you're looking to maximize your portfolio returns, I'd only buy Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor, as Supermicro might be due for a pullback after its stellar run to start the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "At a New All-Time High, Is Nvidia Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "If there was a poster child for the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), there's a strong argument it should be Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock generated blistering gains of 239% in 2023 and was already up 72% so far this year (as of the market close on Monday), regularly notching new all-time highs.\n\nThe company, best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), has adapted its technology to run AI systems and has essentially cornered the market. Rivals are scrambling to invent a better mousetrap, but thus far, none has been forthcoming.\n\nThis has investors in a quandary. After clocking 483% gains in roughly 14 months, is Nvidia stock still a buy? Let's dig into the evidence to see what it reveals. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow Nvidia became the gold standard\n\nIt's easy to dismiss Nvidia's recent run as a delightful happenstance, but it was actually years in the making. More than a decade ago, CEO Jensen Huang focused on technology that wasn't discussed much outside academic circles -- AI.\n\nBack in 2009, researcher Geoffrey Hinton, widely acknowledged as the \"Godfather of AI,\" used Nvidia processors to train a deep learning neural network, laying the ground for much of the AI research that followed. After achieving astonishing results, Hinton sang the praises of Nvidia GPUs to his colleagues, who soon began using the processors for AI, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nSince then, Nvidia has become the gold standard for machine learning, an established branch of AI, controlling an estimated 95% of the market, according to market intelligence company CB Insights (via BBC). This extends to data centers, where much of the AI processing is done, as Nvidia controls a dominant 95% share of that market as well, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.\n\nBecause Nvidia was so entrenched in the existing AI market, this paved the way for a groundswell of GPU demand when generative AI broke out early last year.\n\nNvidia's growth is off the charts\n\nIt's this rapid and accelerating demand for AI that has supercharged Nvidia's growth. For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, ended Jan. 28, Nvidia generated record revenue of $22.1 billion, which soared 265% year over year. Profit was also robust, as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 surged 486%. This marked the third successive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf that wasn't enough, management expects the company's growth spurt to continue. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter, Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $24 billion, up 234% year over year and 9% sequentially. This illustrates that the adoption of generative AI continues to accelerate, and there could be more to come.\n\nIs Nvidia stock simply too expensive?\n\nI might as well address the elephant in the room, as it encapsulates the debate that rages on Wall Street: Is Nvidia stock simply too expensive? The answer to that question, quite frankly, is \"it depends.\" Investors have their preferences when it comes to valuation metrics, but truth be told, there isn't one that's the be-all and end-all -- and each has its limitations.\n\nFor example, based on its price-to-earnings ratio of 71, the stock appears wildly expensive, more than double the value of the S&P 500. Furthermore, at 35 times sales, the stock also appears ridiculously expensive, as a reasonable price-to-sales ratio is generally considered to be between 1 and 2. These are the two most commonly used valuation metrics, which would suggest the stock is too expensive.\n\nUnfortunately, neither of these backward-looking metrics factors in Nvidia's relentless and ongoing triple-digit growth. For that, we turn to the price/earnings-to-growth ratio, which values Nvidia at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nA vast and growing opportunity\n\nDespite its rapid adoption, it's important to remember that generative AI is still in its infancy. These next-generation AI systems appeared just over a year ago, and the number of use cases is growing exponentially.\n\nWhile estimates vary wildly regarding the potential size of the AI market, the generative AI market alone could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in economic value annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nIt's unlikely that Nvidia can keep up its relentless pace of growth indefinitely, and the days of easy comps are in the rearview mirror. Furthermore, a rival could create a processor that's better equipped to handle the rigors of AI -- and a host competitors are working to achieve that goal.\n\nThat said, given Nvidia's entrenched position, the breadth of the opportunity, and reasonable valuation, investors would do well to at least consider owning a piece of this runaway train.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500. To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Worst Performing Stocks in S&P 500.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index was up nearly 6.9% year-to-date, as of February 26, and continues its rally that started in late October. The rally was supported by investor optimism about potential interest rate cuts in 2024 as the Federal Reserve’s battle to control inflation seems to be bearing fruit. Recently, Goldman Sachs lifted its S&P 500 index year-end target to 5200 which represents further 4% growth for the Index based on current levels. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast from 4700 which was announced in its 2024 Outlook report in December.\n\nGoldman Sachs is forecasting an 8% profit increase for the companies in the S&P 500 index, led by strong mega-cap profit margins and improved macroeconomic outlook in the country. David Kostin, lead strategist at Goldman Sachs, expects the earnings strength of mega-cap stocks, especially those in the Magnificent 7, boosting aggregate S&P 500 profits in 2024. Kostin believes that strong global GDP and a “slightly weaker” dollar will lead to positive EPS.\n\nWall Street added several consecutive weeks of market recovery since the last few days of October. The “Magnificent Seven”, which includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, have played a significant role in this bull run. These stocks benefitted heavily from the significant breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence. For instance, GPU-maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up more than 430% since the beginning of 2023 and nearly 63% year-to-date, fueled by exponential growth in its revenue.\n\nOur list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500 includes companies from sectors that have been severely impacted by the recent adversity in the stock markets. The list includes companies from nine different sectors with a notable absence – the technology sector. In addition to suffering from macroeconomic and industry-wide market adversity, the stocks on our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500 have suffered from individual negative catalysts as well. For instance, Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), the second worst performing stock in S&P 500 year-to-date, is reeling from an accounting scandal as it put its CFO on an administrative leave in late January which saw its stock plummet 24% in a single day.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo recap, the Federal Reserve rapidly increased the interest rates beginning from near zero before March 2022 to the current 5.25%-5.50% range, the highest benchmark rate in the country in 22 years. This led to the failure of several banks in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with $209 billion assets, and Signature Bank with $110 billion assets, in March, and First Republic Bank with $229 billion assets in May 2023. https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-best-performing-stocks-in-the-last-12-months-1184205/\n\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list of 15 worst performing stocks in S&P 500, we first ranked the S&P 500 stocks based on their year-to-date performance. The stocks in this article have been ranked based on their year-to-date performance, with the worst performing stock ranked the highest. We have also provided hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks for reference.\n\nData from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.”\n\n7.

        "content": "You may be hearing the word “AI bubble” a lot these days, especially regarding the stock market. Since OpenAI released its artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT in Nov. 2022, it feels like every company in the world has been getting into the AI business.\n\nMachine learning is a type of AI that allows computers to learn and reproduce how humans learn and use that to replicate their behaviors. As you might imagine, machine learning has the potential to decrease the cost and time of human tasks and eliminate redundant work.\n\nCompanies are set to save billions of dollars by integrating machine learning tools and software in their businesses. As investors, not only is it important to look at which companies are successfully using machine learning, but also the companies that are providing these tools to be used. This article will discuss three of the top machine-learning stocks to buy while the AI industry remains red-hot.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the global leader when it comes to producing GPUs that can power machine-learning computers. The stock has been on a tear over the past year, returning north of 240% to shareholders, while surging up the list of the world’s most valuable companies. Despite such unprecedented growth, Yahoo Finance analysts still remain optimistic for with with a one-year target between an average of $852.10 to a high of $1,400.0.\n\nWhen it comes to machine-learning GPUs, NVIDIA is second to none in the semiconductor industry. NVIDIA has more demand for its chips than it has supply even at elevated prices, an its customers include some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nYou might think that a stock that has risen by more than 240% in one year is overinflated. The fact is, that NVIDIA’s revenue has grown so fast that its growth has kept pace with its stock valuation. Looking comparatively, NVIDIA’s forward P/E ratio of 34.25x is still lower than the likes of Amazon and Tesla. As long as AI and machine learning are being adopted, NVIDIA’s stock should continue to reap rewards for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a company that needs no introduction. It is the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in the world and single-handedly revolutionized the auto industry. While its stock has lagged behind its other Magnificient 7 counterparts in 2024 due to high-interest rate environments, its consensus one-year price target still aims for a high of $345.00.\n\nSo, how does an electric vehicle company operate in the machine-learning industry? Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, has long been trying to master self-driving technology. Tesla’s FSD or full self-driving software has had some roadblocks from regulatory agencies like the NHTSA in America, but Musk remains confident that it will be available to all Tesla users in the future.\n\nTesla’s stock still trades at a premium, especially since the company has reported declining operating margins and fairly stagnant revenue growth. The forward P/E ratio of the stock shows that TSLA is trading at about 65x forward earnings, which is nearly double that of NVIDIA. As mentioned, Tesla’s stock could continue to struggle until interest rates begin to decline. Savvy long-term investors might be taking this period of consolidation as a time to load up on the high-growth stock.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a data analytics and software company that has a very polarizing following on social media. At one time, Palantir was looked at as a meme stock, but the company has since proven to be profitable and has exhibited impressive growth.\n\nWhile the operations of Palantir have always been shrouded in mystery, the company has made clear progress in growing its customer base over the past few years. One of the ways it has done this is by introducing its AIP or Artificial Intelligence Platform. AIP uses machine learning to help large-scale enterprises unluck insights from large sets of data. From this analysis, companies can identify inefficiencies and operate at a higher level.\n\nWe did mention Palantir’s stock is trading at the high end of analyst estimates, right? Well, although it is a much smaller company, Palantir’s valuation currently dwarfs that of both NVIDIA and Tesla. At its current price, Palantir’s stock trades at about 25x sales and 79x future earnings. With the potential to be considered for S&P 500 inclusion later this year, and management guiding a FY2024 revenue of around $2.6 billion, Palantir is a worthy company to look into capitalizing off machine learning.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NVIDIA\n\nComing to Z by HP AI Studio, NVIDIA CUDA-X Data Processing Libraries Boost Python Pandas Software for Millions of Data Scientists\n\nLAS VEGAS, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HP Amplify — NVIDIA and HP Inc. today announced that NVIDIA CUDA-X™ data processing libraries will be integrated with HP AI workstation solutions to turbocharge the data preparation and processing work that forms the foundation of generative AI development.\n\nBuilt on the NVIDIA CUDA® compute platform, CUDA-X libraries speed data processing for a broad range of data types, including tables, text, images and video. They include the NVIDIA RAPIDS™ cuDF library, which accelerates the work of the nearly 10 million data scientists using pandas software by up to 110x using an NVIDIA RTX™ 6000 Ada Generation GPU instead of a CPU-only system, without requiring any code changes.\n\nRAPIDS cuDF and other NVIDIA software will be available as part of Z by HP AI Studio on HP AI workstations to provide a full-stack development solution that speeds data science workflows.\n\n“Pandas is the essential tool of millions of data scientists processing and preparing data for generative AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO at NVIDIA. “Accelerating pandas with zero code changes will be a massive step forward. Data scientists can process data in minutes rather than hours, and wrangle orders of magnitude more data to train generative AI models.”\n\n“Data science provides the foundation for AI, and developers need fast access to software and systems to power this critical work,” said Enrique Lores, president and CEO of HP Inc. “With the integration of NVIDIA AI software and accelerated GPU compute, HP AI workstations provide a powerful solution for our customers.”\n\nNVIDIA CUDA-X Speeds Data Science on HP Workstation Solutions\r\nPandas provides a powerful data structure, called DataFrames, which lets developers easily manipulate, clean and analyze tabular data.\n\nThe NVIDIA RAPIDS cuDF library accelerates pandas so that it can run on GPUs with zero code changes, rather than relying on CPUs, which can slow workloads as data size grows. RAPIDS cuDF is compatible with third-party libraries and unifies GPU and CPU workflows so data scientists can develop, test and run models in production seamlessly.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs datasets continue to grow, RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs provide 48GB of memory per GPU to process large data science and AI workloads on Z by HP workstations. With up to four RTX 6000 GPUs, the HP Z8 Fury is one of the world’s most powerful workstations for AI creation. The close collaboration between HP and NVIDIA allows data scientists to streamline development by working on local systems to process even large generative AI workloads.\n\nAvailability\r\nNVIDIA RAPIDS cuDF for accelerated pandas with zero code changes is expected to be available on HP AI workstation solutions with NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs this month and on HP AI Studio later this year.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

        "content": "By Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n\n(Reuters) - Investors have piled into Nvidia-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year on the frenzy around AI, with inflows into a bullish fund that tracks the shares of the chip designer hitting an all-time high on Wednesday.\n\nNet daily inflows into the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF hit a record of $197 million, according to LSEG Lipper data. The assets managed by the ETF have grown to $1.41 billion from $213.75 million at the start of the year.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nRisk-averse investors have largely stayed away from leveraged ETFs tracking single stocks that aim to provide returns over extremely short periods.\n\nThese ETFs, which made their U.S. debut in 2022, have become popular among speculators looking to bet on the most volatile shares based on earnings and other news.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nNvidia, which controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, has surged nearly 82% since the start of the year after a stellar forecast and amid renewed euphoria around AI.\n\nLeveraged single-stock ETFs seek to amplify the returns of an underlying stock for a single day, generally by two or three times, using financial derivatives and debt as leverage.\n\nKEY QUOTES\n\n\"Nvidia has been the hottest stock in 2024 and many investors are eager to seek out higher returns in exchange for added risk,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, chief ETF strategist at VettaFi.\n\n\"We expect to see continued demand for single stock leveraged ETFs as a new wave of must-own companies emerge.\"\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nNet monthly inflows into leveraged ETFs tracking Nvidia such as the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA ETF, the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 1.5X Shares ETF and the T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF hit a record in February.\n\nThe GraniteShares ETF has already crossed its net monthly flow record within the first six days of the month.\n\nAssets of the three Nvidia-linked ETFs jumped between five and 11 times since the start of 2024, while their prices are up between 143% and 218% year-to-date, outperforming other ETFs.\n\n(Reporting by Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 Biggest Countries with Elections in 2024. If you want to skip to our overview of the election campaigning industry, then you can take a look at our 10 Biggest Countries with Elections in 2024.\n\nThe year 2024 is on its way to setting the record for the largest global elections held in a single year. This report by Weforum shows that 2024 is a historic election year, with elections in 50 countries. More than 2 billion voters- which is around a quarter of the world's population- will head to the polls in countries including the United States, India, Mexico, and South Africa. Another article by The Guardian indicates that over 80 nations, including those of the richest and most powerful, the most populated, the most autocratic, and the most vulnerable, will be voting this year.\n\nCurrently, India occupies the first position according to the population sample. Among the 1.4 billion people living in India, around 900 million are registered voters, while the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, is running for a third five-year term in office. In the Weforum report, Chatham House explains that India is the biggest democracy in the world and a \"growingly significant geopolitical actor\" on a global scale.\n\nMeanwhile, in the global north, data from the US Government’s Census suggests that out of 341 million Americans, 160 million are registered to vote.  They will select the 60th President of the United States, who will assume office in January 2025. They will hold office for four years. Although former President Donald Trump is aiming for a second, non-consecutive term in office, incumbent President Joe Biden is seeking to achieve a second term.\n\nThe relection of either Trump or Biden could have significant impact on stock portfolios.\n\nPortfolio Wealth Advisors president Lee Munson is of the view that either of the two candidates, if elected, could be pose trouble for chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, they said that Trump could pose bigger trouble.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Biden has not been friendly to China, but Trump's going to be even worse,\" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. \"When you look at Trump, he's mercurial and could just cut off the tap... and tell Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) they can’t sell anything.\"\n\nA total ban could be a massive hit to major American chip players. China accounted for about one-third of the worldwide sales in the sector in 2023, with AI giants like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) generating close to 20% of their revenue from the country.\n\n\"Companies that rely on China for sales or for supply chains are going to have to adapt,\" Lee Munson added.\n\nUS Elections 2024 and the EV Industry\n\nIf the 2024 elections end up with a Republican-led white house, the new administration may review the Inflation Reducation Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. A reversal or reduction in subsidies for green technologies could hurt the EV industry, particulary when it comes to OEMs and battery companies. It could lead to these companies to source cheaper materials from outside of North America in the absense of federal credits. 25 Biggest Countries with Elections in 2024\n\nAlexandru Nika/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nGiven the wide variety of countries with elections coming up in 2024, it may be tricky to assess the top 25 countries with elections in 2024. However, it is necessary to keep track of what is going on in the world. New governments rise as old ones fall in their shadows. Even more, it is our responsibility to inform the general public of what is happening around them globally. Our article selects the 25 biggest countries with elections in 2024 by establishing a division by population in descending order. Data for country populations has been retrieved from The World Bank. For some countries, we have given additional descriptions of the fairness of these elections as ranked by Our World in Data through a ‘Freedom and Fairness Index”. This index contains metrics such as access to justice for women, and men, age of democracy, and others. This index gives countries a score from 0 to 1, where 0 means completely unfair on all metrics and 1 means completely fair. Lastly, the dates of elections are taken from Anchor Change and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n25 Biggest countries with elections in 2024\n\n25. Chad\n\nPopulation: 19.047 million\n\nDate: October (Expected)\n\nThere are strong signs that the presidential and parliamentary elections in Chad in November will be a well-planned ploy to keep General Mahamat Déby in office. Following the passing of his father, President Idriss Déby, who had also usurped power in a coup thirty years prior, Déby assumed control of the Chadian government in an April 2021 military coup.\n\n24. Romania\n\nPopulation: 19.047 million according to\n\nDate(s): November- December (Expected)\n\nAccording to EuroNews, with the next constitutional election in Romania, the far-right party AUR, which is gaining ground, may form a coalition administration.\n\n23. Syrian Arab Republic\n\nPopulation: 22.12 Million Date(s): To be decided\n\nAlthough the 2024 elections have been announced, due to the civil war taking place in the country, it is difficult to say for certain whether the elections will commence according to schedule.

        "title": "Should You Buy Red-Hot Stocks Now or Wait?",
        "content": "Welcome to Episode #393 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss the roaring stock market. If you haven’t bought some of the hottest stocks on the Street, should you still dive in or is it too late to buy?\n\nA friend of Tracey’s asked her over the weekend whether she should buy NVIDIA here. NVIDIA has been hitting new highs nearly every day. There is a fear of missing out, or “FOMO,” component to the stock now if you aren’t already in it. Waiting for a pullback seems useless as there hasn’t been one for weeks.\n\nNot Just Tech Hitting New Highs\n\nBut the question of whether to buy or not after this rally isn’t just about technology stocks. The drug companies with weight loss drugs are also red-hot as are some of the restaurant stocks. Many industries, outside of the banks, oil and natural gas, lithium and the fertilizers, just to name a few, have been up big this year.\n\nIf you’re not yet in these stocks, should you wait for a pullback or should you just dive in?\n\nTracey looked at her favorite stock chart, the Zacks’ Price and Consensus chart, to try and find answers. But maybe the key is NOT the actual technical chart, but in the earnings outlook.\n\nWhat do fundamentals look like?\n\n5 Red-Hot Stocks: Should You Buy or Wait?\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been one of the hottest stocks this year. It seemingly goes up almost every session. NVIDIA shares are up 80% year-to-date.\n\nBut earnings are expected to rise 79.2% in fiscal 2025 after jumping last year. NVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 37, which isn’t high for the company historically. NVIDIA also has a PEG ratio of just 1.25. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it too late to buy NVIDIA?\n\n2. Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL)\n\nDell Technologies recently surprised on earnings again and its shares have taken off. Dell is up 55% year-to-date and is at 5-year highs.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise just 0.7% in fiscal 2025 but 15.6% in fiscal 2026. Dell trades with a forward P/E of just 16.4 and a has a low PEG ratio of just 1.37.\n\nIs it too late to buy Dell Technologies?\n\n3. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY)\n\nEli Lilly is tracking NVIDIA in 2024. It seems like the stock hits a new high every day. Shares of Eli Lilly are up 33.8% year-to-date and 145% over the last year thanks to the demand for weight loss drugs.\n\nEarnings are expected to soar 96.8% in 2024. Eli Lilly now has a high forward P/E of 62.5 but it has a PEG ratio of just 1.7.\n\nIs it too late to buy Eli Lilly?\n\n4. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill continues to impress which is why it is often regarded as one of the top restaurant stocks. Shares of Chipotle are up 17.6% year-to-date but over the last year, they have soared 78.2% to new all-time highs.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise another 18.3% in 2024. Chipotle isn’t cheap on a P/E basis but it hasn’t been for over a decade. Chipotle trades with a forward P/E of 51. It has a PEG ratio of 2.3.\n\nIs it too late to buy Chipotle?\n\n5. CAVA Group, Inc. (CAVA)\n\nCAVA is one of the new up-and-coming restaurant chains. It only went IPO last year, in 2023. But shares of CAVA are up 38% year-to-date.\n\nEarnings are expected to rise 9.5% in 2024 as it continues its growth plan of opening up new locations. CAVA has a sky-high forward P/E of 246, however. And CAVA doesn’t have a PEG ratio on Zacks.com.\n\nIs it too late to buy CAVA?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Buying Stocks During a Big Rally?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Top 7 Under-$15 Stocks to Buy in March 2024",
        "content": "Fifteen bucks won’t go too far these days – unless you want to invest in these under-$15 stocks to buy.\n\nInflation growth may be falling, which obscures the real fact that pricing today for goods and services remains higher than just two years ago. That’s an obvious fact since inflation is measured as a function of continued growth rather than real pricing differences. This is one of the multiple reasons that consumer confidence remains low despite “good” inflation stats.\n\nAt the same time, high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are rapidly pricing retail traders out of the market. That’s where these under-$15 stocks step in. Cheap enough to accumulate a sizeable position, each stands ready to rapidly accelerate based on unique circumstances and bullish tailwinds, propelling them to success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) stands out among under-$15 stocks to buy, as it’s ready to leverage the ongoing semiconductor industry boom through its distinct approach.\n\nThe company’s operational model differentiates it from newcomers and established industry leaders by focusing on developing and providing test systems that guarantee semiconductor reliability and quality. As semiconductors grow smaller, more complex, and costlier, the demand for sophisticated testing systems is set to skyrocket. These demands and expectations, in turn, secure Aehr’s position for substantial growth as a small-cap, under-$15 stock.\n\nIn January, Aehr reported impressive financial results, with a 45% increase in revenue year over year and a 63% boost in GAAP net income. CEO Gayn Erickson has highlighted potential challenges, including a slowdown in the electric vehicle (EV) market growth rate, which might impact order timings from both existing and prospective clients.\n\nLuckily, Aehr’s expertise extends beyond the EV industry, encompassing semiconductor chips in 5G, AI, machine learning, and more. Even with potential EV market obstacles, Aehr is on track for a remarkable performance in 2024 and beyond, thanks to its specialized yet wide-ranging expertise.\n\nStory continues\n\nSteelcase Inc (SCS) Creative image of growing coin stacks and candlestick forex chart on blurry background. Trade, money and financial growth concept. Growth stocks. Double exposure\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nHigh-end office furniture Steelcase Inc (NYSE:SCS) isn’t just adapting to work-from-home trends – the company is thriving. That’s evident from the company’s recently announced $0.10 quarterly dividend, representing a 61% payout ratio and 2.88% yield.\n\nAfter a rocky pandemic period, Steelcase is rapidly regaining financial strength. The company’s most recent quarterly report marked $30.8 million in net income, more than double the prior year’s period. At the same time, sales remain steady right around $800 million over the past five quarters – meaning that Steelcase is improving margins without sacrificing quality.\n\nSteelcase is working to reorient itself within the work-from-home paradigm and projects 5-7% annual sales growth and 5% free cash flow (as a percentage of revenue) over the next five years. At the same time, the company aggressively cut down on debt in light of the higher-rate environment, improving liquidity and keeping interest costs low. This makes it one of those under-$15 stocks to buy.\n\nClearPoint Neuro (CLPT) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nClearPoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) is a small-cap healthcare stock trading well below $15, but that doesn’t make the company’s prospects any less attractive. Last month, the firm secured another win as its ClearPoint 2.2 software integrated with Maestro Brain Modeling locked FDA approval in a major move that improves surgical precision when it comes to brain and spinal navigation. ClearPoint expects the product to hit markers in 2024’s second half, providing a healthy boost to top and bottom-line financials. The approval comes on the heels of the FDA approving its SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System, which offers a non-invasive alternative to precise cancer targeting.\n\nCLPT shares slumped over the past few weeks after the company announced a dilutive share offering to raise cash. While not ideal, small-cap companies like ClearPoint need cash to expand, particularly in the tech-heavy sector ClearPoint operates within. The per-share pricing dip likely won’t last long, making the under-$15 stock destined to break into double-digit pricing soon. All in all, it’s one of those under-$15 stocks to buy for investors to consider.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Graphic of green and blue arrow against pale green background pointing up and to the right, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ex_artist\n\nWhen Warren Buffett buys an under-$15 stock, investors pay attention. That’s why satellite radio Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) stands out as a unique choice backed by the billionaire. In a period where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) sold more stocks than it bought, one purchase stood out – a $167 million investment in Sirius XM. That’s particularly noteworthy as many downplay the stock’s potential. In fact, SIRI remains one of the most shorted stocks as of this writing, with 25% short interest. So why is Buffett bullish on this under-$15 stock?\n\nWhile partially a merger arbitrage play, Buffett isn’t buying SIRI for a short-term trade opportunity. Instead, Sirius XM seems to be one of those classic Buffett value stocks, trading at low multiples with a bright future ahead. The company is also a cash cow, consistently hitting 30%+ EBITDA margins over the past four years while keeping free cash flow well north of $1 billion over the same period. Finally, SIRI offers a modest dividend yield of 4.15% with a payout ratio of 31% – showing that management knows how to manage cash to keep shareholders happy while growing market share.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Rocket launching into space\n\nSource: 3Dsculptor / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) isn’t just another under-$15 stock with potential for significant gains; it’s poised to tap into the burgeoning trillion-dollar space industry. The space stock made a splash last year with a historic number of launches and continues to strengthen its position as a top stock under $15, thanks to a government contract exceeding $500 million and a robust earnings report last week.\n\nThe company boasts a launch and contract backlog valued at approximately $1 billion. Although these orders are subject to cancellation, they provide a rough forecast of Rocket Lab’s future revenue potential. With fourth-quarter revenue reaching $60 million, this backlog hints at substantial future growth. Rocket Lab’s management anticipates first-quarter revenue to rise to between $92 and $98 million, reinforcing its growth trajectory.\n\nAs Rocket Lab is still in a phase of aggressive expansion and backlogs don’t immediately translate to cash flow, the company is expected to continue seeking funding, likely through equity or convertible debt offerings, as seen last month. Although such actions dilute shareholder value temporarily, they are strategic moves to broaden Rocket Lab’s operational scope – and set conditions for the under-$15 stock to skyrocket.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A person playing mobile games and PC games at the same time.\n\nSource: Dean Drobot/Shutterstock.com\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) is making big moves beyond basic gaming based on recent indicators, which could send the under-$15 stock soaring soon. This week, the company renewed licensing for haptic tech that could offer insight into Nintendo’s next move based on past rumors. You may recall that last year, a Nintendo leak alleged a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) partnership to develop a next-gen virtual reality headset. While the rumor remains just that – a rumor – adding haptic feedback tech to Nintendo’s suite of tools points to something big brewing below the surface.\n\nBeyond gaming, Nintendo is also capturing upside from its massive intellectual property catalog through movie licensing. Last year’s Super Mario Bros. Movie was a resounding success, bringing in more than $1.4 billion at the box office. Keeping the momentum going, Nintendo recently announced a Zeldaadaptation that will likely match or surpass Mario’s ticket sales. And, of course, Nintendo’s core products remain popular – even as hardware delays pushed its new console release to early 2025. This makes it one of those under-$15 stocks to buy.\n\nHanesbrands (HBI) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nHanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) is a top innerwear clothing seller, capturing 60% of the total addressable market in multiple countries – but share pricing remains low for the under-$15 stock. In fact, shares trade just north of $5 today, marking a shockingly low 0.34x price-to-sales ratio.\n\nBeaten up by supply chain struggles and slack consumer confidence, Hanes’ management is actively right-sizing operations and tightening its reach. Last month, the company solicited tentative bids for its Champion clothing line as it reorients its focus away from athletic wear and back toward core innerwear offerings. The starting bid is rumored to be $1.4 billion, a solid payout that simultaneously serves to help Hanes narrow its lens.\n\nLast year, activist investment firm Barington Capital Group issued an open letter (or challenge) to Hanes, demanding cost reductions, inventory cuts, and margin recovery. It seems likely that Hanes took Barington’s words as inspiration for the Champion deal – meaning we’re just starting the road to recovery for this under-$15 stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Like many other tech firms, customer relations management software specialist Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is making a move into the generative artificial intelligence market. Is this a smart move, or is Salesforce just a latecomer that’s desperately latching on to the gen-AI trend? This is a crucial question that you should seriously consider if you’re thinking about buying CRM stock.\n\nIn addition, prospective investors need to take a close look at Salesforce’s forward sales guidance. This, along with the company’s surprisingly high valuation, may dissuade you from taking a long position in Salesforce stock.\n\nSalesforce and Gen-AI: Jumping on the Bandwagon\n\nNot long ago, Salesforce announced a generative AI assistant called Einstein Copilot. As soon as I saw this, I immediately thought that Salesforce is late to the gen-AI trend and is jumping on an already crowded bandwagon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven the product’s name indicates Salesforce is a trend follower, not a leader. After all, Einstein Copilot sounds a lot like Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot gen-AI assistant.\n\nOne reporter described this phenomenon as tech firms having a “throw everything at the wall” gen-AI moment. The reporter didn’t mention Salesforce by name, but Einstein Copilot fits perfectly into the “throw everything” category.\n\nEinstein Copilot would have been a groundbreaking, market-moving product if it had come out two years ago, or even one year ago. Now, however, it feels like Salesforce isn’t breaking any new ground at all.\n\nIs CRM Stock Actually More Overvalued Than Nvidia Stock?\n\nAs you may already be aware, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently delighted the market with revenue guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations. The same cannot be said about Salesforce, however.\n\nIndeed, Salesforce most recently released quarterly financial report guided for fiscal 2025 revenue of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. This range falls short of Wall Street’s call for revenue of $38.62 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not a wide guidance shortfall, but it suggests that Salesforce might not post blockbuster sales numbers in the coming quarters. Yet, somehow the market has already assigned a highly elevated valuation to Salesforce.\n\nHow elevated? Put it this way: Salesforce’s GAAP-measured trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 73.53x. For comparison, the sector median P/E ratio is 29.5x, and Nvidia’s P/E ratio is 66.31x.\n\nThus, according to this commonly cited metric, Salesforce is more richly valued than Nvidia. Some of you probably didn’t expect this, but the numbers don’t lie.\n\nSalesforce Stock: Let It Fall Before You Make the Call\n\nDon’t get the wrong idea. Salesforce is a leader in CRM software. However, the company definitely isn’t a first mover in the gen-AI trend.\n\nInvestors should wonder whether Salesforce really ought to have a higher valuation than Nvidia. So, finally, it makes sense to let CRM stock come down to a more favorable price point – such as $275 – before considering a long share position.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia May Be the Bubble of the Century, and History Suggests It Won't End Well",
        "content": "Since this year began, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth-powered Nasdaq Composite have all put the 2022 bear market in the rearview mirror and catapulted to all-time closing highs. Although megacap stocks have done a lot of the heavy lifting, it's Wall Street's next-big-thing investment trend, artificial intelligence (AI), which is fueling this move.\n\nWhen talking about AI, I'm referring to the software and systems being used in place of humans to carry out tasks. The secret sauce for AI is machine learning, which allows software and systems to learn over time and become more efficient at their tasks and/or learn new tasks.\n\nThe reason AI stocks have soared is simple: AI has application in almost every sector and industry. Though estimates vary wildly, the analysts at PwC believe artificial intelligence can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has ridden its competitive advantages in AI to historic gains\n\nNo company has benefited more from the AI revolution than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWhen the curtain opened on 2023, Nvidia boasted a $360 billion market cap that had primarily been driven higher over the years by its dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming and cryptocurrency mining. As of the closing bell on March 4, 2024, Nvidia's market cap had swelled to $2.13 trillion. Only Apple and Microsoft stand in its way of becoming the largest publicly traded company.\n\nNvidia's skyrocketing stock is a reflection of its dominance as the infrastructure backbone of high-compute data centers. Its A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for the lion's share of GPUs deployed in enterprise-operated AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nWith demand absolutely overwhelming supply, Nvidia has enjoyed top-notch pricing power for its class-leading GPUs. Although production of its A100 and H100 GPUs is expected to increase this year as chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing expands its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, the bulk of Nvidia's data center sales growth has been driven by higher prices for the A100 and H100 supply it does have to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut if things have seemed a bit too good to be true for Nvidia, history says they probably are.\n\nHistory suggests AI and Nvidia are the latest in a string of next-big-thing bubbles\n\nOne of the few certainties Wall Street has to offer is that there's always a next-big-thing investment acting as a dangling carrot for opportunistic investors. Dating back 30 years, we've witnessed more than a half-dozen major investment trends that were expected to be game changers. While each and every one of these trends initially sent their respective stocks soaring, they all, eventually, came crashing back down.\n\nThe advent of the internet revolutionized business across the board. However, the anticipated adoption of e-commerce and business-to-business commerce caused many dot-com stocks to implode between 1999 and 2002. Genome decoding has been steadily transforming the drug-development and disease-detection/prevention process for decades. But the exceptionally high costs of genome decoding in the late 1990s burst this bubble. Housing was an unstoppable force in the mid-2000s, with property values increasing at well over twice the rate of inflation. Unfortunately, poor lending standards from financial institutions, coupled with risky derivative investments, sunk this ship. China stocks were also on fire in the late 2000s, with investors expecting the world's No. 2 economy by GDP to sustain its outsized growth rate. However, most China stocks succumbed to poor internal controls and eventually tumbled. 3D printing was expected to be the hottest thing since sliced bread at the consumer level. But by the mid-2010s, it became apparent that 3D printer hype was mostly a fad. Cannabis stocks have shared a similar fate. Although U.S. cannabis sales have the potential to grow by a double-digit rate throughout the decade, marijuana remaining illicit on Capitol Hill has stifled profitability for the industry. Electric vehicles (EVs) looked like a slam-dunk investment, given the desire of developed countries to reduce their carbon footprints and combat climate change. Yet, we've witnessed a lack of adequate supporting infrastructure holding the EV industry back. Blockchain technology was expected to be the next big thing in banking that would ultimately weed out fraud, expedite cross-border transaction validation, and reduce fees. But as we've seen, broad-based blockchain utility has been hit-and-miss. The concept of the metaverse sent augmented and virtual reality stocks soaring in 2021. However, the sizable investments needed to develop 3D virtual worlds mean little immediate impact (i.e., sales) to the businesses focused on metaverse projects.\n\nWhat all of these next-big-thing investments have in common is an overzealous investor base whose expectations for the uptake of a new innovation or trend simply didn't meet reality. Some investors might be tempted to proclaim that \"this time is different\" when it comes to artificial intelligence, but history suggests it's not.\n\nMost businesses are still figuring out how they'll utilize AI to improve sales and bolster profits. Without concrete game plans, this looks like a recipe for AI uptake to eventually disappoint, just like every other next-big-thing investment before it over the past three decades. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHeadwinds are mounting for the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement\n\nIn addition to history not being on Nvidia's side, there are a number of headwinds the company is set to contend with this year.\n\nOne of the more ironic challenges for the infrastructure kingpin of the AI revolution is that increasing production of its A100 and H100 GPUs may be detrimental to its gross margin. Relatively modest increases in cost of revenue demonstrate that GPU scarcity powered its gross margin higher last year. As Nvidia increases its production, it'll be cannibalizing its own pricing power by limiting GPU scarcity.\n\nCompetition will also be coming at Nvidia from every direction. Traditional competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are rolling out AI-GPUs that will directly compete with Nvidia's chips in high-compute data centers.\n\nBut the bigger concern is the competition Nvidia is facing from within. The company's four largest customers by revenue (in no particular order) -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- make up roughly 40% of Nvidia's sales on a combined basis. All four of these juggernauts are developing AI chips of their own, which could lessen or remove their respective reliance on Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs.\n\nU.S. regulators are doing Nvidia no favors, either. They've put their foot down on a couple of occasions and restricted exports of high-compute AI chips to China. Not being able to ship its top-of-the-line AI-GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy may cost Nvidia billions in lost revenue each quarter.\n\nLastly, the valuation doesn't make as much sense as some investors might think. While its price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) suggests the company is priced reasonably, Nvidia is currently valued at 38 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales. With the exception of the dot-com peaks for Amazon and Cisco Systems, which both lasted for mere days and topped out at around 40 and 38 times TTM sales, respectively, there hasn't been a market leader that's ever been valued at such a premium to sales.\n\nIt's possible Nvidia is the bubble stock of the century.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Board members at Nvidia— the AI company no one can stop talking about that is at the forefront of the tech evolution—are reaping the benefits of a runup in the company’s stock. Shares in the company traded at $887 today, up 26.5% this month alone.\n\nFour insiders sold holdings via multiple transactions in the past four weeks, SEC filings show. They joined a growing list of executives who have unloaded billions in company stock in recent months. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon logged his first-ever stock sale last month to the tune of $150 million, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold $8.5 billion in Amazon stock. Meta Platforms founder Mark Zuckerberg sold $1.2 billion and private equity founder Leon Black made his first-ever sale worth $172.8 million.\n\nOn the Nvidia board, Tench Coxe, former managing director at venture capital investment firm Sutter Hill Ventures, sold $170 million in company stock in three transactions yesterday. As a director, Coxe earns restricted stock valued at $255,000 annually and $85,000 in cash. Coxe has been an Nvidia board member since 1993.\n\nSimilarly, board member Mark Stevens offloaded 12,000 shares of stock worth $10.2 million this week after shedding 15,000 shares last month, worth about $12 million. Stevens is managing partner at private family office investment firm S-Cubed Capital and was previously a partner at VC investment company Sequoia Capital. Stevens was a director from 1993 to 2006 and rejoined the board in 2008. Stevens previously sold 36,000 shares in January when the stock was about $546 for about $19.7 million.\n\nAnother board member, Mark Perry, sold 15,000 shares for about $11.9 million on Feb. 23, just two days after the company reported earnings on Feb. 21. Perry has been a director for nearly a decade and is a consultant for nonprofits and former CEO at biopharmaceutical company Aerovance.\n\nHarvey Jones, a longtime director who also joined the board in 2003, carved off a portion of his stake in the company for about $53 million. Jones is managing partner of Square Wave Ventures.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite their sales, Coxe, Jones, Stevens and Perry still have significant stakes in the AI chip developer. Coxe holds around 4.1 million shares, Jones holds nearly a million shares, Perry holds 152,000 and Stevens holds 4.4 million shares. CEO Jensen Huang holds about 86 million shares in the company, a 3.5% stake.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy sold 50,000 shares in Amazon this week for about $9 million. His sale was made as part of a trading plan set up in advance.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "SK Hynix Investing $1 Billion to Widen Lead in AI Memory Chips",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- SK Hynix Inc. is ramping up its spending on advanced chip packaging, in hopes of capturing more of the burgeoning demand for a crucial component in artificial intelligence development: high-bandwidth memory.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Nikki Haley Ends 2024 Bid, Setting Up Trump-Biden Rematch New York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight Crime Stocks and Bonds Climb as Powell Sticks to Script: Markets Wrap Egypt’s Devaluation and Record Rate Hike Put IMF Deal in Reach\n\nThe Icheon-based firm is investing more than $1 billion in South Korea to expand and improve the final steps of its chip manufacture, said Lee Kang-Wook, a former Samsung Electronics Co. engineer who now heads up packaging development at SK Hynix. Innovation with that process is at the heart of HBM’s advantage as the most sought-after AI memory, and further advances will be key to reducing power consumption, driving performance and cementing the company’s lead in the HBM market.\n\nLee specializes in advanced ways of combining and connecting semiconductors, which has grown in importance with the advent of modern AI and its digestion of vast troves of data via parallel processing chains. While SK Hynix has not disclosed its capital expenditure budget for this year, the average analyst estimate puts the figure at 14 trillion won ($10.5 billion). That suggests advanced packaging, which could take up a 10th of that, is a major priority.\n\n“The first 50 years of the semiconductor industry has been about the front-end,” or the design and fabrication of the chips themselves, Lee said in an interview. “But the next 50 years is going to be all about the back-end,” or packaging.\n\nBeing first to achieve the next milestone in this race can now catapult companies into industry-leading positions. SK Hynix was chosen by Nvidia Corp. to provide the HBM for its standard-setting AI accelerators, pushing the Korean firm’s value up to 119 trillion won. Its stock has gained nearly 120% since the start of 2023, making it South Korea’s second most valuable company and outperforming Samsung and US rival Micron Technology Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nLee, now 55 years old, helped pioneer a novel method to packaging the third generation of the technology, HBM2E, which was quickly followed by the other two major makers. That innovation was central to SK Hynix winning Nvidia as a customer in late 2019.\n\nStacking chips to derive greater performance has long been Lee’s passion. In 2000, he earned his PhD on 3D integration technology for micro-systems from Japan’s Tohoku University, under Mitsumasa Koyanagi, who invented stacked capacitor DRAM used in mobile phones. In 2002, Lee joined as principal engineer at Samsung’s memory division, where he led the development of Through-Silicon Via (TSV)-based 3D packaging technologies.\n\nThat work would later become the foundation for developing HBM. HBM is a type of high-performance memory that stacks chips on top of one another and connects them with TSVs for faster and more energy-efficient data processing.\n\nBut back in the pre-smartphone era, Samsung was making bigger bets elsewhere. And the norm was for global chipmakers to outsource to smaller Asian nations the tasks of assembling, testing and packaging chips.\n\nSo when SK Hynix and US partner Advanced Micro Devices Inc. introduced HBM to the world in 2013, they remained unchallenged for two years before Samsung developed its HBM2 in late 2015. Lee joined SK Hynix three years later. They joked, with a measure of pride, that HBM stood for “Hynix’s Best Memory.”\n\n“SK Hynix’s management had better insights into where this industry is headed and they were well prepared,” said Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA Securities Korea. “When the opportunity came their way, they grabbed it with both hands.” As for Samsung, “they were caught napping.”\n\nChatGPT’s release in November 2022 was the moment Lee had been waiting for. By that time, his team had developed a new packaging method called mass reflow-molded underfill (MR-MUF), aided by his contacts in Japan. The process, which involves injecting and then hardening liquid material between layers of silicon, improved heat dissipation and production yields. SK Hynix teamed up with Namics Corp. in Japan for the material and a related patent, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nSK Hynix is pouring the bulk of its new investment into advancing MR-MUF and TSV technologies, Lee said.\n\nSamsung, which has for years been distracted by a succession saga at its very top, is now fighting back. Nvidia last year gave the nod to Samsung’s HBM chips, and the Suwon-based company said on Feb. 26 it has developed the fifth generation of the technology, HBM3E, with 12 layers of DRAM chips and the industry’s largest capacity of 36GB.\n\nOn the same day, Boise, Idaho-based Micron surprised industry watchers by saying it begun volume production of 24GB, eight-layer HBM3E, which will be part of Nvidia’s H200 Tensor Core units shipping in the second quarter.\n\nWith its big commitment to expanding and enhancing technology at home and a multibillion-dollar advanced packaging facility planned for the US, Lee remains bullish about SK Hynix’s prospects in the face of intensifying competition. He sees the present investment as laying the groundwork to meet more demand to come with future generations of HBM.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built Humanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers Elon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "The Q4 earnings cycle has primarily finished, with most S&P 500 companies already reporting. It’s been a positive period, underpinned by the Technology sector’s strong performance. On the other hand, the Energy sector has been weighing negatively on the earnings picture.\n\nSeveral companies stole the spotlight throughout the period – Meta Platforms META, NVIDIA NVDA, and Deckers Outdoor DECK – posting robust quarterly results. Shares jumped following the release of each, reflecting investors’ bullish reactions.\n\nIn addition to solid quarterly results, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, reflecting upward trending earnings estimate revisions among analysts. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nDeckers Outdoor\n\nDeckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities.\n\nThe revisions trend has been notably bullish for its current fiscal year, with the $26.85 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate 24% higher over the last year and suggesting 38% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning headline figures, DECK posted a 32% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 8.5% ahead of expectations, reflecting growth rates of 44% and 16%, respectively. Impressively, EPS of $15.11 and revenue of $1.6 million reflected quarterly records, driven by strength across its UGG and HOKA brands.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDeckers provided bright guidance following the release, now expecting current-year net sales of $4.15 billion and a gross margin of 54.5%.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nRegarding the report in focus, Meta Platforms generated $40.1 billion in sales, improving by a sizable 25% from the year-ago period. Top-line results reflect a considerable acceleration, with the 25% jump penciling in the highest year-over-year growth rate in eight quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and earnings expectations are rising across all timeframes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s platform also continues to expand, with Facebook daily and monthly active users growing by 6% and 3%, respectively. And its advertising business remains sound, with ad impressions delivered across its family of apps improving 21% year-over-year.\n\nMETA has consistently posted better-than-expected advertising revenue, exceeding our consensus expectations in six consecutive releases. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nOf course, Data Center was the real highlight of NVIDIA’s quarterly release, which included sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA’s Data Center raked in $18.4 billion (another quarterly record) throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nRobust quarterly results have led analysts to rapidly revise their earnings expectations higher over the last year, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s growth profile is remarkably bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 80% earnings growth on 70% higher sales. And the growth doesn’t stop, with FY26 expectations alluding to an additional 11% bump in earnings on 15% higher revenues.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings cycle is essentially over, with the vast majority of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The Technology sector has been a significant contributor, helping brighten the overall market landscape.\n\nAnd for those seeking post-earnings positivity, all three companies above – Meta Platforms META, NVIDIA NVDA, and Deckers Outdoor DECK – posted results that had investors impressed.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If picking the top tech stocks with potential was easy, we’d all have a portfolio full of surprising breakout stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy. But that doesn’t mean finding tech stocks with potential is hard, either.\n\nToday’s economic and interest rate climate means tech stocks with potential aren’t just prioritizing growth at all costs. Instead, tech stocks with potential leverage growth and market share while combining both with prudent financial management. At the same time, each of these three stocks offers unique, company-specific tailwinds set to propel them higher over the coming year.\n\nTrip.com Group (TCOM) Trip.com Group logo on a smartphone. TCOM stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nTourism plays a critical role in China’s economy, and Trip.com Group (NASDAQ:TCOM) is uniquely positioned among tech stocks with potential, benefiting from long-term growth in the sector. After a rough few years, Trip.com is poised to benefit significantly from the end of China’s Zero-Covid policies. Bottom line: 2023’s economic initiatives are expected to lead to a mild cyclical recovery in China in 2024, pushing tourism rates higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrip.com serves as a comprehensive platform for ticketing, hotel bookings and travel planning, catering to over half of China’s tourism market. Before the pandemic, China’s international tourism was on an upward trajectory, with 154.63 million international outbound tourists in 2019. That number plummeted to just 20.33 million in 2020 due to the pandemic. However, the sector has shown signs of recovery; by the first half of 2023, over 40 million tourists had ventured abroad from China. Although these numbers are still well below pre-pandemic figures, the quick rebound following the cessation of the Zero-Covid policy and an anticipated economic turnaround positions Trip.com as a leading contender for this year’s top international tech stock.\n\nFabrinet (FN) a picture concept of network cables\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN) is firmly within the tech stocks with potential arena, matching Nvidia in terms of AI-driven business focus and remarkable growth, boasting a surge of over 80% in the past year. It’s important to note that Fabrinet is a key supplier to Nvidia, the semiconductor behemoth, playing a crucial role in the competitive race for AI supremacy. While Nvidia and its rivals compete at the forefront of the AI “gold rush,” Fabrinet ensures its profitability by providing essential components needed in the industry, securing its success regardless of the market leader.\n\nThe company specializes in producing and supplying optical cables, which are critical for data transmission across various hardware platforms at unparalleled speeds exceeding 800GB per second. These cables are pivotal for the development of machine learning and AI technologies. Remarkably, this particular line of products contributes $500 million to Fabrinet’s revenue, underlining its significance to the company’s financial health. The outlook for Fabrinet’s growth is incredibly strong, with projections suggesting that its operational income could double shortly.\n\nMoreover, with a valuation of just 2.9x sales and 31x earnings, Fabrinet presents an attractive investment opportunity. The global economic environment is improving, and technology firms continue prioritizing AI development. To that end, Fabrinet stands ready to emerge as one of the standout tech stocks with potential in 2024.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading analysts from Citi (NYSE:C), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) are identifyingArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) as a standout stock with potential in the AI sector despite it flying under the radar compared to more high-profile tech stocks. That dynamic will likely change in 2024, as the company capitalizes on expanding cloud and AI opportunities. Citi’s Atif Malik particularly emphasized Arista’s potential to benefit from the generative AI megatrend and various early AI-related opportunities.\n\nArista’s stock experienced stagnation after an earnings report that delivered subdued guidance, causing a temporary dip before a modest recovery last month. The decrease might stem from analysts’ overly optimistic expectations, with a Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analysis suggesting that ANET needed to achieve “near perfect” earnings to justify an increase in its share price. Despite these challenges, ANET continues to hold promise, especially as investor interest shifts back towards “hard tech” in AI, moving focus away from software solutions and toward companies like Arista with tangible, innovative technologies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions (directly or indirectly) in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Nvidia ‘Bubble’ Talk Spreads to ESG Fund Managers Who Rode Highs",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Concerns that Nvidia Corp.’s stratospheric gains might be unsustainable have spread to ESG investment managers who beat the market last year by betting big on the stock.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChemical Linked to Cancer Found in Acne Creams Including Proactiv, Clearasil Nikki Haley Ends 2024 Bid, Setting Up Trump-Biden Rematch Egypt’s Devaluation and Record Rate Hike Put IMF Deal in Reach Olivia Rodrigo Is Not Kid-Friendly? Don't Act Surprised. New York to Deploy National Guard to NYC Subways to Fight Crime\n\n“I’m optimistic in the long run, but recognize that the valuation isn’t exactly attractive,” said Kristofer Barrett, who oversaw a decision to make Nvidia the biggest holding in Swedbank Robur Technology last year, transforming it into the top performer in a Bloomberg ranking of ESG funds. The Swedbank fund, which is registered as “promoting” environmental, social and governance metrics under European Union rules, returned 53% in 2023.\n\nBut there’s now some concern that Nvidia may end up a victim of its own success, according to Barrett.\n\nThere’s a “realization that this has become a retail stock,” he said. “And that portends a bubble, potentially.”\n\nOverall, the proportion of ESG funds holding Nvidia shares dropped to 15% of the total at the end of December from a high of 20% in the second quarter of 2023, according to fresh data provided by Morningstar Direct.\n\nThe figures, which cover equity-oriented open-end and exchange-traded funds that satisfy Morningstar’s ESG criteria, show that the value of those funds’ exposure to Nvidia was roughly $17.6 billion at the end of last year, down about 10% from the middle of 2023. In the same period, Nvidia’s market value rose 17%.\n\nNvidia enthusiasts point to its iron grip on the chips needed to develop artificial intelligence, after Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang managed to turn a niche maker of graphics cards for gamers into a $2 trillion technology colossus. And so far, warnings of a sudden downturn in Nvidia shares have generally been followed by eye-popping gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Nvidia’s market value soared almost 240%, and is already up almost 80% in 2024. Of the 66 analysts tracking Nvidia, none is advising clients to sell, while 60 say investors should continue to buy the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nESG funds betting big on Nvidia are delivering better returns than their peers. Among these is the Robecosam Net Zero 2050 Climate Equities fund, which is registered under the EU’s strictest ESG disclosure rules. Chris Berkouwer, who manages the Robeco fund, says Nvidia is treated as a “transition facilitator” in his portfolio, based on a view that its technology will help companies across industries cut their environmental footprints.\n\nThe $150 million fund, which counts Nvidia among its biggest holdings, is up about 7% in the past month, outperforming more than 90% of its peers, Bloomberg data show.\n\n“We’re still quite optimistic on Nvidia,” said Berkouwer. Nvidia’s latest quarterly results, which the company used to deliver a sales forecast that once again surpassed analyst estimates, has “kept the AI dream alive,” he said.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\nNvidia is significantly increasing supply to meet surging demand, which is expected to exceed all-time highs this fiscal year across revenue, Ebitda, net income, cash from operations and free cash flow. Upgrades from both Moody’s and S&P in 2023 highlight the company’s sustainable competitive advantages in the accelerated computing category.\n\nClick here to read the full Feb. 24 report by BI’s Robert Schiffman and Abigail Marshall.\n\nNvidia Ebitda Consensus F2025-2027:\n\n“Despite the price going up significantly, the earnings have risen even more,” said Berkouwer, who notes that Nvidia is part of a “balanced mix” in his portfolio. “That is really impressive and a testament to Nvidia being able to successfully meet that demand.”\n\nBut as Nvidia morphs into one of the world’s absolute biggest companies, there’s also a growing number of skeptics. Cathie Wood, despite being an outspoken proponent of the transformational potential of AI stocks early on in the cycle, actively trimmed her exposure to Nvidia last year and other big-name stocks tied to the AI boom.\n\nAnd hedge funds that piled into tech stocks before Nvidia’s latest set of results are now exiting at the fastest pace in seven months, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s prime-brokerage unit.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nBarrett, who’s leaving Swedbank for a role at another firm he can’t name until an official announcement has been made, was replaced as portfolio manager of the Swedbank Robur Technology fund in February.\n\nChristian Blink, who now runs the Swedbank fund, said Nvidia “might be a little bit stretched” in the short term, with the possibility of some investors seizing the moment to cash in.\n\nFurther out, the outlook is positive. “We believe that people tend to underestimate the long-term implications from generative AI and Nvidia is an enabler for that technology,” Blink said.\n\nAnd Nvidia remains the fund’s biggest holding, now accounting for almost 10% of the roughly $15 billion Swedbank portfolio, he said.\n\nA bubble is “always a worry,” Blink said. “I don’t think there is one, but many factors are there for generative AI to become one. We are monitoring that.”\n\n--With assistance from Nick Turner and Amy Thomson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Immigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers The Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office Chair Nvidia Is the Latest Shiny Object to Spur Stocks to New Heights Why Elon Musk Has It In for Sam Altman\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "When we talk about stocks that have been overlooked, it usually means that they haven’t been receiving a lot of buzz. It could also mean these stocks have underperformed their peers or the benchmark S&P 500, and likely have some catching up to do. When it comes to investing, it often pays to look at companies that others are overlooking.\n\nThe three stocks we’ve chosen for this article span a wide range of industries. We believe that despite how they have performed so far this year, there is a lot more upside to come. So whether it is a semiconductor titan, a growing crypto miner or an elevator manufacturer, it’s definitely worth looking at overlooked stocks and zig when others zag. Here are our top choices for overlooked stocks that should be on your radar for the rest of 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest chip fabrication company. What does that mean? It designs and manufactures semiconductors for other companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Currently, Wall Street analysts project a one-year target range of $125.77 to $160.00.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHow can one of the world’s largest companies be overlooked? Well, if you haven’t noticed, AI and chip stocks have completely taken over this market. Two of TSMC’s largest customers are NVIDIA and Arm Holding (NASDAQ:ARM). These stocks have returned 70.82% and 105.5% respectively to shareholders in 2024 so far. But without TSMC, none of these companies would be able to sell their high-powered chips. If demand for these chips is as high as these companies say it is, then TSMC has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nThere is also a bit of a dark cloud that hangs over this stock. Many investors have shied away from TSMC due to concerns over China. Nonetheless, with the stock trading at a friendly multiple of just 21x future earnings and a fairly reasonably 10x TTM sales, TSMC is a pick-and-shovel play for the hottest industry on the planet.\n\nStory continues\n\nCleanSpark Inc (CLSK) Bitcoin cryptocurrency with pile of coins, Vector illustrator\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) is a Bitcoin mining company that utilizes sustainable and renewable energy sources. It has risen as of late due to the rally in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but we believe that this bull run is just starting.\r\n\r\nBut, how can a stock that has already returned 64% in 2024 be considered under-the-radar? That’s because we believe there are exponentially more gains to be made this year. Bitcoin miners tend to rise as the price of Bitcoin does. In April, the Bitcoin halving will effectively cut that output in half for miners. But CleanSpark is already prepared for this. The company is purchasing four, fully-operational Bitcoin mining facilities to account for the drop in revenue. Compared to the industry average post-halving cost-to-mine price of $47,117 per BTC, CleanSpark’s average price is just $28,093.\n\nWith analyst targets of more than $100,000 by the end of 2024, CleanSpark is a company that not many have heard of which can provide exponential returns during this crypto bull run.\n\nOtis Worldwide Corporation (OTIS) momentum stocks: a smartphone screen displaying the Otis Worldwide (OTIS) logo\n\nSource: rafapress/shutterstock.com\n\nOtis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS) is the world’s largest elevator manufacturing and maintenance company. The odds are high that we have all ridden in one of its elevators at some point in our lives. This is exactly the type of boring stock that compounds gains year after year. As of March, Wall Street analysts are putting OTIS’s one-year target range between an average of $95.40 to a high of $105.00.\r\n\r\nWe’re not going to try and sugarcoat it, this is a boring stock. How many of you even knew that Otis was a publicly traded company? The company only went public in 2020 after it was spun off from United Technologies. Since then, it has returned more than 111% to shareholders and has raised its dividend by an average of 19.4% each year. With an amazing profit margin also set to continue increasing in 2024, Otis is definitely a company that will lift the returns of any portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been on a hot streak over the past year or so, and that trend shows little signs of slowing.\n\nIt isn't just average investors that are bullish on these developments. Billionaires, venture capital firms, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have AI fever -- and one start-up in particular is attracting a lot of attention. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSome of the biggest names in technology\n\nFigure AI is working on a humanoid robot -- dubbed Figure 01 -- that has attracted a lot of attention. It was founded by serial entrepreneur Brett Adcock, who also founded Archer Aviation -- an aerospace company working on an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft.\n\nMeet Figure 01 pic.twitter.com/mQa2b59Vju\n\n-- Figure (@Figure_robot) October 18, 2023\n\nIn its most recent funding round, the start-up attracted financing from billionaire Jeff Bezos and Ark Investment Management's Cathie Wood, as well as Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and AI wunderkind OpenAI -- the start-up that arguably kicked off the AI revolution. Figure AI raised roughly $675 million, which valued the start-up at roughly $2.6 billion.\n\nFigure AI developed an autonomous robot that can help alleviate labor shortages in warehouses, transportation, and retail. Just last week, Figure released a video to demonstrate its progress. It says these fields have 7 million unfilled jobs and not enough workers to fill them. Figure recently announced its first commercial agreement to supply BMW with general-purpose robots for automotive production.\n\nHow can investors get in on the action?\n\nIt might be difficult for investors to invest directly in Figure AI, as the start-up is privately held, but they can invest indirectly. For example, Microsoft is among the largest investors at $95 million, so buying shares of Microsoft will get you indirect exposure to Figure AI, though a very small amount.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there are plenty of other reasons to buy Microsoft to take part in the AI revolution.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Nvidia initiated, Target upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. \r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Target (TGT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $206, up from $149, post the Q4 report. The company's initial 2024 guidance appears reasonable, while leaving room for upside, the firm tells investors in a research note. HSBC also upgraded Target to Buy from Hold with a price target of $195, up from $140. Berenberg upgraded Honeywell (HON) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $240, up from $195. In the context of the stock's current valuation, the firm sees Honeywell's growth algorithm as attractive. Wolfe Research upgraded GitLab (GTLB) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $75 price target. Following GitLab's print, which sent shares down 21%, the firm sees a \"story of potentially being one of the fastest growers in software this year with multiple product catalysts and significant upside from pricing.\" Morgan Stanley upgraded Progressive (PGR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $227, up from $185. Progressive's \"strong culture\" of technology innovation, favorable competitive environment, and gradual business mix shift should give it the ability to outgrow the market, the firm argues. Leerink upgraded Regenxbio (RGNX) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $37, up from $24. With the Phase 1/2 AFFINITY DUCHENNE update, RGX-202 has accumulated enough data to suggest a path to a differentiated role in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, the firm says.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nBerenberg downgraded Rockwell Automation(ROK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $290, down from $330. Following a \"soft\" Q1, there is an unusually high second half bias to the company's earnings this year, implying near-term earnings risk is more skewed to the downside, the firm says. CLSA downgraded Nio (NIO) to Outperform from Buy with a price target of $6, down from $9.80. The firm says that while Nio has made steady progress on the construction of its battery swapping network, it sees slower growth, driving reduced estimates. RBC Capital downgraded ChargePoint (CHPT) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $3, down from $3.50. While the company's fiscal Q2 results slightly beat expectations, the Q1 guidance shows continued revenue pressure as a result of sluggish macro demand, the firm tells investors in a research note. Canaccord downgraded TTEC Holdings(TTEC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $13, down from $30. The firm says the macro environment remains tough and TTEC's clients remain reticent about committing to service volume levels more than a month or two out. BofA downgraded Old Dominion(ODFL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $446, up from $443. The firm sees limited upside given the stock's elevated multiple and the fact that volume growth has lagged BofA's forecast, the firm says.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nCICC initiated coverage of Nvidia (NVDA) with an Outperform rating and $870 price target. Nvidia is reaping benefits from its increasing cloud capex and the short supply of computing power for the training of large language models, or LLMs, in the market and the firm expects it to maintain its leading position in AI computing on technological strengths and ecosystem advantages. Evercore ISI initiated coverage of Casey's General Stores(CASY) with an Outperform rating and $345 price target. Casey's is well positioned to leverage its scale advantage and consolidate a \"large and fragmented\" convenient store market, the firm tells investors in a research note. Argus initiated coverage of Supermicro (SMCI) with a Buy rating and $1,350 price target. The firm is positive on the company's position as a leading computer and server provider for the age of generative AI, also noting that it provides GPU-based systems for deep learning, high performance computing, and other applications. Needham initiated coverage of Pure Storage(PSTG) with a Buy rating and $66 price target. Pure Storage has persistently gained market share from competitors with its \"differentiated\" direct-to-flash storage offering, the firm notes. Craig-Hallum initiated coverage of WisdomTree (WT) with a Buy rating and $12 price target. The firm believes significant growth potential in managed models remains and says the company's first-mover advantage in blockchain \"presents a practical, outsized risk/reward.\"",

        "content": "Itron Inc. ITRI recently announced the buyout of Elpis Squared to leverage energy utilization for its grid edge intelligence technology.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 30 countries with the highest GDP in 2023. If you want to skip the detailed analysis, click 5 Countries with the Highest GDP in 2023.\n\nEconomic Outlook for 2024\n\nThe global economy is experiencing a tough time following the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, the economy is heading toward recovery while facing severe threats including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Middle East crises amid the ongoing bomb shelling on Gaza, and rising climate change risks, among others. In 2023 Asian economies and markets have collectively performed well relative to the rest of the global economies despite inflation headwinds and China’s property market crisis. The property market crisis in China has started to impact the global markets. On February 9, Bloomberg reported that Chinese investors and their creditors are putting their real estate holdings ‘For Sale’ across the globe as they are in dire need of raising cash amid the escalating property crisis in China. The Chinese real estate market is on the verge of offloading into a falling market. In addition, more than $1 trillion has been wiped off of office property values due to massive borrowing cost hikes worldwide, as per Starwood Capital Group Chairman Barry Sternlicht. In 2023, global commercial property deals plunged to the lowest level in a decade, with owners unwilling to sell properties at massive discounts.\n\nAsia is considered the region with the highest growth potential for the 21st century. As we mentioned earlier in our article on the 25 fastest-growing economies in the world in 2023, the growth forecast for Asia is projected at 4.8% for 2024, while inflation in developing Asia is forecasted to drop to 3.5% in 2024 compared to 3.6% and 4.4% in 2022 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, the macro headwinds impacting Asian markets will likely subside. All eyes are on the US Fed making a final decision on easing its tightening policy. On February 26, CNBC reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon believes that the market’s odds for a soft landing are 70% to 80%. He added that the market expectations for the US economy to experience a soft landing are too high. During the JPMorgan High Yield and Leveraged Finance Conference in Miami, Jamie Dimon said:\n\nStory continues\n\n“It’s always a mistake to look at just the year. All these factors we talked about quantitative tightening, fiscal spending deficits, the geopolitics, those things may play out over multiple years. But they will play out and they will have an effect and in my mind, I’m just kind of cautious about everything.”\n\nChina remains a regional and global wild card for 2024 as its economy continues to find a way to sustain recovery following a serious crisis in the residential real estate market. The Euro area is expected to rebound slightly after a challenging 2023, facing high energy prices and tight monetary policy. Brazil and India have been among the top-performing economies with strong resilience. As we mentioned earlier in our article on the 50 richest countries in the world by GDP per capita in 2024, India is projected to grow at 6.5% in the financial year 2024. Africa follows Asia as the second fastest-growing region and it is projected to grow at an average rate of 3.8% in 2024 and 4.2% in 2025, which is above projected global averages.\n\nCompanies Driving the Largest Economies\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Li Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ:LI), and Reliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) are some of the largest companies based out of leading economies in the world. These large multinational corporations have a huge impact on the economies where they operate.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the largest tech companies based out of the United States and is one of the best long-term tech stocks to buy as well. On February 21, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The company posted a remarkable outcome, with earnings per share of $5.16, beating consensus estimates by $0.53. The revenue came in at $22.10 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.56 billion. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making record breakthroughs through its data center business as AI becomes the biggest tool for the chipmaker. Here are some of the comments from the Q4 2024 earnings call:\n\n“Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO, and energy efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose-built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases, and regions.”\n\nReliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) is one of the largest multinational companies based out of India. On February 28, the company announced that its media subsidiary, Viacom 18 Media Private Limited, and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have signed definitive agreements to merge Viacom18 and Star India. The Walt Disney Company’s (NYSE:DIS) merger of its Star India service with Viacom18 is worth $8.50 billion. In addition, Reliance Industries Limited (NSE:RELIANCE) will invest nearly $1.4 billion into the new joint venture as part of its growth strategy.\n\nLi Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the largest EV makers in China. On February 26, Li Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) announced its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company posted earnings per share of $0.59, beating estimates by $0.26. Li Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) reported $5.80 billion in revenue for Q4 2023, surpassing consensus estimates by $265 million. Li Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) has become the leading Chinese automotive company by market share. Here are some of the comments from the Q4 2023 earnings call:\n\n“2023 was a year of accelerated growth for Li Auto. We delivered a total of 376,000 vehicles for the entire year, exceeding our target setting at the beginning -- set at the beginning of 2023 and also making us the first emerging new energy automaker in China to exceed the 300,000 annual deliveries mark. Our total deliveries for the fourth quarter reached 131,805 vehicles, an increase of 184.6% year-over-year. In December, we reached another significant milestone of 50,000 monthly deliveries, setting a new record for Chinese premium car brands. According to China Automotive Technology and Research Centers insurance registration data in China's NEV market of RMB200,000 and higher, Li Auto's market share increased from 10.9% in Q1 2023 to 16.0% in Q4, making us a leading Chinese automotive brand by market share, the growth will continue in 2024.”\n\nThese were a few leading companies based out of some of the largest economies in the world.

        "title": "Will Broadcom Be the Next AI Stock To Explode on Friday?",
        "content": "If you thought 2023 was the year of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, 2024 has been a pleasant surprise.\n\nAI stocks have gone from hot to scorching this year, led by sector winners like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the AI chip superstar, and Super Micro Computer, a maker of AI servers and storage equipment. Nearly every AI stock has jumped on its earnings report so far this year, including Arm Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor, ACM Research, and just last week, Dell Technologies. The evidence in the sector continues to indicate that demand for AI hardware and components is ramping exponentially and exceeding Wall Street's expectations.\n\nOn Thursday, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) will be the latest AI stock to test this pattern, as it will report earnings after the market closes. Broadcom, a diversified semiconductor maker, has gained 21% so far this year, a sign it's also benefited from the rising AI tide.\n\nWill Broadcom stock continue the AI hit parade and jump on its earnings report on Friday? Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom and AI\n\nBroadcom has a market cap of more than $600 billion, and a number of Wall Street analysts have pinpointed it as the second-biggest AI chip stock winner after Nvidia. However, Broadcom plays a different role in artificial intelligence than Nvidia, which has a dominant market share of the GPUs (graphics processing units) and accelerators used in data centers to run massive AI models that make programs like ChatGPT run.\n\nBroadcom isn't known for GPUs or chips used for training and inference, which are the major computing demands of AI applications. Instead, Broadcom's strength is in the networking chips that allow AI components to work together. For example, last April, the company launched its new Jericho3-AI fabric designed for high-performance connectivity for a 32,000 GPU cluster, and CEO Hock Tan cited demand for \"network connectivity for AI by hyperscalers\" as a key driver in the company's growth last fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement also noted on the earnings call that generative AI revenue represented $1.5 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, which was 20% of its semiconductor revenue or 16% of total revenue. That's significant, and management expects robust networking growth in fiscal 2024, which began in November at 30%, driven in part by an expansion of AI accelerators at cloud infrastructure services. It also forecasts generative AI revenue improving from 15% of semiconductor revenue in 2023 to 25% in 2024.\n\nInvestors should be aware that Broadcom is not experiencing the kind of blowout growth that Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have seen, as it's sensitive to the industry cycle and is seeing headwinds in some of the end markets it serves, like telecoms. In the fourth quarter, Broadcom's revenue rose just 4% to $9.3 billion.\n\nHowever, investors have shown that immediate revenue growth isn't necessary for a stock to benefit from the AI boom. Dell Technologies shares, for example, jumped 32% on its earnings report last Friday, even though the company actually reported an 11% decline in Q4 revenue. Despite that, growing demand for its AI servers was enough to send the stock soaring. Similarly, Arm shares also surged on its earnings report in February even though revenue only rose 14%. In its case, increased guidance from AI-related business signaled the company is capitalizing on the AI boom and drove shares dramatically higher.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy?\n\nGoing into the fiscal first-quarter earnings report, analysts have modest expectations for Broadcom's results, which its recently closed acquisition of VMware will impact. The average estimate calls for revenue of $11.72 billion, up 31% from a year ago, but sees earnings per share falling slightly from $10.33 to $10.29, which is partly a reflection of integrating VMware.\n\nIf you're considering buying shares of Broadcom ahead of the earnings report, you're best off taking a long-term approach to the stock. Earnings movements are difficult to predict accurately, and even the best stocks will miss earnings on occasion.\n\nFor long-term investors, Broadcom looks like a good choice for several reasons. It has a long track record of beating the market. CEO Hock Tan is well-regarded for operating with ruthless efficiency and is expected to squeeze more profits out of VMware, and the company looks well-positioned to benefit from the growth of AI market, even though it's too diversified to see the kind of soaring growth that Nvidia has experienced. It also trades at a reasonable valuation.\n\nAs for the stock's response to the earnings report on Friday, the recent evidence from AI stock peers bodes well for Broadcom, and it wouldn't be surprising to see the company lift its guidance for AI-based growth based on what we've seen from its peers. Options traders are also betting on Broadcom to pop on Friday, indicating the odds may be in its favor. However, I think a huge surge in the stock like Dell and Arm recorded seems less likely given Broadcom's large size, diversification in businesses that are not directly exposed to AI, and investor attention on the VMware acquisition.\n\nNo matter the extent of a potential surge, I'm more confident in the company's long-term potential in AI and beyond, given its history of execution and strength in networking solutions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "'She's such a genius': RFK Jr. jokingly calls Nancy Pelosi 'an incredible investor' for making millions from well-timed stock trades — here are the Pelosis' 2 big bets right now\n\nThe debate over whether politicians should be permitted to trade stocks has been contentious. However, the position of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on this matter is unequivocally clear.\n\nDuring a recent cryptocurrency conference in Denver, an audience member asked RFK Jr. about his view on stock trading by politicians, specifically mentioning Democratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The former House Speaker has received attention lately for her major wins in the market.\n\nDon't miss\n\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation Can I collect my dead spouse's Social Security and my own at the same time?

It has seen a 34% increase over the last 12 months, beating the S&P 500's already impressive 25% return during the same timeframe.\n\nWhile past performance does not guarantee future results, those interested in emulating Pelosi’s investment strategy might want to pay attention to her two most recent trades, as reported by trading data platform Unusual Whales, which also serves as the data provider for the NANC ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia\n\nShortly before the holiday season, Pelosi disclosed through a filing that her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi, bought 50 call options on Nvidia (NVDA) with an expiry date of Dec. 20, 2024 and a strike price of $120. The reported transaction value was between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nA call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a specified price within a certain time period. Typically, the value of a call option tends to rise when the price of the underlying asset increases.\n\nIt appears that Pelosi’s bet was well-placed. Since the reported transaction date of Nov. 22, 2023, Nvidia shares have soared by 76%.\n\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a prominent trend in the tech sector. As a leading chipmaker, the tech giant is reaping significant rewards from investors’ insatiable appetite for AI. The stock has surged nearly 265% over the last 12 months and a staggering 2,180% in the last five years.\n\nBusiness is firing on all cylinders. Nvidia recently reported that its Q4 revenue grew by 265% year-over-year, while its earnings per share skyrocketed by 765%.\n\nRead more: Here's how much the average 60-year-old American holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare?\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is one of the largest cybersecurity companies in the world.\n\nIt also represents Pelosi’s latest investment interest.\n\nA new filing revealed that on Feb. 12, 2024, Paul Pelosi purchased 50 call options on Palo Alto Networks with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025 for a total value of between $500,001 and $1 million.\n\nBut that was not all. On Feb. 21, Paul Pelosi bought another 20 call options on Palo Alto Networks with the same strike price and expiration date for a total value of between $100,001 and $250,000.\n\nShares of Palo Alto Networks fell after the company lowered its full-year guidance in its latest earnings report. Management now expects full-year revenue to be between $7.95 billion to $8 billion, a decrease from the previous guidance of between $8.15 billion and $8.2 billion. Additionally, total billings are now guided at $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion for the year, compared with the previous projected range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.\n\nDespite this recent downturn, PANW stock is still up 55% over the past year.\n\nWhat to read next\n\n'The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' — here's what he likes for protection 'We're looking at a downsized America': Kevin O'Leary warns any new house, car and lifestyle you enjoy will be significantly 'smaller' — here's what he means and how you can prepare Bill Burr once complained to Joe Rogan that his bank took $28 every month 'for no reason' — now the government is taking action on these frustrating fees.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 6, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Coinbase Global Inc. COIN, CleanSpark Inc. CLSK, Block Inc. SQ and BlackRock Inc. BLK.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Top Crypto-Centric Stocks to Tap the Bitcoin Rally\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC), has resumed its northward journey after a brief pause last week. The cryptocurrency closed Mar 4, at 68,411.81, marking its highest level since November 2021. Bitcoin posted its all-time high at 68,982.20 in November 2021.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market started 2024 on a positive note after an impressive rally last year. The much-hyped reformation in the cryptocurrency space took place on Jan 10. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved rule changes to allow the creation of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in January.\n\nAfter soaring 157% in 2023, Bitcoin has rallied more than 21% year to date. Bitcoin continues to hold a lot of potential. The SEC’s latest decision is likely to turn out to be a landmark, positioning the entire crypto space as an integral component of mainstream finance.\n\nThe game-changing decision of the SEC will allow individuals, money managers and other financial institutions to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin halving will occur in April 2024. When this occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 79.2% (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 16.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. provides financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy in the United States and internationally. COIN offers the primary financial account in the crypto space for consumers, a marketplace with a pool of liquidity for transacting in crypto assets for institutions; and technology and services that enable developers to build crypto-based applications and securely accept crypto assets as payment.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Coinbase Global has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days.\n\nCleanSpark Inc. operates as a bitcoin miner in the Americas. CLSK owns and operates data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. CLSK’s infrastructure supports Bitcoin, a digital commodity and a tool for financial independence and inclusion.\n\nZacks Rank #2 CleanSpark has an expected earnings growth rate of 89.2% for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last seven days.\n\nBlock Inc. is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. In addition, SQ’s decentralized tbd platform allows developers to build decentralized finance applications to run on programmable blockchains. SQ is also one of the largest Bitcoin investors.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Block has an expected earnings growth rate of 62.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last 60 days.\n\nBlackRock Inc. is one of the world’s largest publicly owned investment managers. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race in June 2023. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has crossed $10 billion in assets under management in less than two months.\n\nZacks Rank #2 BlackRock has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in March, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "It's been another banner start to the year for Wall Street. After oscillating between bear and bull markets in successive years since this decade began, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have all climbed to record highs in 2024.\n\nThough there have been select pockets of strength fueling this surge in the broader market, Wall Street's gains primary fall on the shoulders of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have powered the broader market higher\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to seven of the largest and most-influential businesses that have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over an extended stretch. These seven stocks are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAs noted, these stocks have run circles around the S&P 500 for quite some time. MSFT Chart\n\nBut what they've really brought to the table for investors is sustained competitive advantages, if not outright impenetrable moats in various aspects of their operations.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the world's leading desktop operating system, while Azure accounts for a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spending, as of Sept. 30, 2023. Apple's ongoing innovation has given the iPhone a commanding market share lead among smartphones in the United States. The former largest company in the world also boasts the beefiest share repurchase program on the planet. Nvidia's has become the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for up to a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. Further, Amazon Web Services tops Microsoft's Azure as the leading global provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google is a practical monopoly, with almost a 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Meanwhile, Google Cloud is the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure provider, and YouTube is the second most-visited social site. Meta Platforms oversees the top social media assets, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Meta's family of apps attracted close to 4 billion monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the first automaker to build itself from the ground up to mass-production in over a half-century. It's also the only pure-play EV maker generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlooks for these seven companies could differ greatly. As we motor into March, one Magnificent Seven stock stands out as a bargain hiding in plain sight, while another highflier is liable to contend with mounting headwinds.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in March: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven long-term outperformers listed above, the most-attractive Magnificent Seven stock for opportunistic investors in March is Alphabet.\n\nIf Alphabet can be faulted for anything, it's being a cyclical company. Last year, 76% of the company's $86.3 billion in net sales were traced back to advertising. If the U.S. economy were to dip into a recession, it's practically a given that businesses would pare back their ad budgets. At the moment, a few money-based metrics and predictive indicators do signal a high likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHowever, economic cycles aren't even. Whereas no recession since the end of World War II has lasted longer than 18 months, there have been two periods of growth that sustained for longer than a decade. Advertising-driven businesses like Alphabet (and Meta, since we're discussing the Magnificent Seven) are primed for long-term upside as the U.S. economy expands.\n\nThere's no question that Alphabet's internet search segment Google is its foundation. A nearly 92% share of worldwide search makes Google the undisputed company businesses are going to seek out for ad placement in order to target consumers. More often than not, Alphabet should enjoy exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nBut as I've noted in the past, the Alphabet growth story is about far more than just its dominant internet search engine. Google Cloud has gobbled up about 10% of the global cloud infrastructure service market. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its relatively early stages, which suggests this segment can grow by a sustained double-digit pace.\n\nWhat's more, Google Cloud delivered its first year of operating profits in 2023 after multiple years of losses. Cloud services consistently boast higher margins than advertising, which suggests Alphabet's cash flow growth is set to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nYouTube is a beast, too. Daily views of Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds), which were introduced in 2021, have catapulted from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to more than 50 billion in early 2023. This should help the company draw in advertisers, as well as boost high-margin subscriptions to YouTube.\n\nLastly, Alphabet remains historically inexpensive. Since Alphabet reinvests a lot of what it generates from its operations, cash flow is the best metric to value the company. Investors can buy Alphabet shares right now for a little over 12 times forward-year cash flow estimates, which is a 31% discount to its trailing-five-year cash flow multiple. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in March: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not every Magnificent Seven stock is poised for continued glory. Among the seven most-influential companies driving Wall Street higher over the past year and change, it's semiconductor stock Nvidia that should be avoided like the plague.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has enjoyed ample competitive advantages in the AI arena. GPU scarcity has driven prices of its A100 and H100 chips to the moon, which in turn allowed the company to more than double its sales last year. While Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, the company is set to face headwinds galore.\n\nOne of Nvidia's biggest problems is itself. As supply chain issues ease and Nvidia expands production of its A100 and H100 GPUs to meet more demand, scarcity of GPUs will decline. Price-driven scarcity accounted for the bulk of Nvidia's sales gains last year, as evidenced by cost of revenue declining through the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). As Nvidia expands production, it'll likely cannibalize its own margins.\n\nNvidia will also have competition coming at it from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices is stepping up the rollout of its MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel is set to begin fulfilling orders for its Gaudi3 AI-GPU later this year.\n\nThe real concern is that many of Nvidia's biggest customers are also developing AI data center chips of their own. This includes Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, which account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's sales. Not only is it highly unlikely that these four companies will sustain recent purchase activity from Nvidia, but the AI chips they're developing will lessen future reliance on the current AI kingpin.\n\nRegulators aren't doing Nvidia any favors, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of high-powered AI chips to China. This includes AI GPUs that Nvidia had developed specifically for the world's No. 2 economy after regulators initially clamped down on exports. Regulators could be costing Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nFollowing the money of company insiders is another reason to avoid Nvidia like the plague. While there have been plenty of sales, there hasn't been a single insider purchase in more than three years. Insiders only buy for one reason: they believe the stock will head higher. If they aren't adding, why should you?\n\nBut maybe the biggest concern for Nvidia and its shareholders is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption of new technology and innovation; and it appears to be happening in real time, once again.\n\nNvidia is valued at close to 34 times its trailing-12-month sales, which is a valuation reminiscent of Cisco Systems during the height of the dot-com bubble. This makes Nvidia an interesting story stock, but one to avoid like the plague for investment purposes in March.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The AI-driven surge in stocks over the past year has raised questions about whether the market is in a bubble that is close to popping. For now, Wall Street strategists say the answer is no.\n\nMany see comparisons of the current market rally to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s or the meme stock mania in 2021 as premature.For starters, the current rally hasn't been as obscene as others that coincided with the late stages of previous bubbles.\n\nStocks have rallied about 31% over the past three years. This is largely in line with average returns over a three-year time period and a far cry from the 98% three-year return seen at the start of 2000 or the 90% return seen at the end of 2021.\n\n\"We are not yet close to those levels, even as the market sits at all-time highs,\" Baird investment strategy analyst Ross Mayfield wrote in a note to clients on Monday night. \"There’s room to run.\"\n\nThe underlying dynamics of the current rally don't indicate the market has reached levels of euphoria on par with past bubbles either.\n\nUsing an enterprise value-to-sales ratio, Goldman Sachs analyzed the percentage of US stocks that have what the firm considers to be high valuations. The results showed that highly valued stocks currently account for 24% of the US equity market, lower than the 28% seen in 2021 and the 35% during the tech bubble of the late 90s.\n\nNotably, there are also far fewer overvalued companies contributing to this recent run.\n\n\"If we look at the number of companies that are trading at very elevated multiples, that looks even less extreme relative to history,\" Goldman Sachs equity analyst Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance. \"So effectively, as we all know, there are a small number today of very large companies trading at elevated multiples, rather than what we saw in 2021, just a couple years ago, where there seemed to be widespread euphoria priced across the market.\"\n\nHe acknowledged the lack of breadth in the current rally resembles that of the dot-com bubble. ButSnider believes the crucial difference this time around is that moves higher in many of the large-cap tech stocks have been in line with earnings growth. Snider says that was not the case with market darlings like Nortel Networks in the dot-com bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, AI leader Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has soared more than 255% over the past year. But its earnings have also kept pace: In the past fiscal year, which the company just finished reporting in late February, earnings grew 288%.\n\nBy comparison, in 1999 Nortel stock rose more than 320%. Adjusted earnings per share grew about 94% that year, per Bloomberg data. Nortel eventually filed for bankruptcy and is no longer a publicly traded entity.\n\n\"Our view is that this is not a bubble and the simplest explanation is that prices and the valuations of these megacap stocks, whether you're calling them the Mag Seven or others, have really been driven by a combination of superior growth and strong balance sheets, and both of those qualities historically have warranted premium valuations,\" Snider said.\n\nCapital Economics market economist John Higgins has a slightly different view: He thinks the market is in a bubble, but just in the early stages of one. Higgins noted that there has yet to be a run-up in margin debt, or money investors borrowing to buy stocks, alongside equities' upward surge. A Capital Economics chart from Feb. 12 shows tech valuations haven't reached the stretched levels seen in the dot-com bubble. (Capital Economics)\n\nThis was the case in the moments of market exuberance seen in both the dot-com bubble and the 2021 rally, and often means the bubble can \"end in tears\" as leverage is quickly unwound by a drop in the market and ensuing spree of forced selling.\n\n\"The conclusion to draw simply from that alone would be we're not in the late stages of a bubble, at least not based on the way that rising margin debt has typically accompanied the next stages of prior bubbles,\" Higgins said.\n\nHiggins thinks the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will rise to 6,500 by the end of 2025 as tech valuations reach closer to levels seen during the dot-com bubble. But even that, Higgins notes, is merely an estimation based on how far investors were willing to stretch the bubble in the early 2000s. This time around could be different.\n\n\"Nobody knows how big a bubble will get before it bursts, how long it will take to inflate, or what, in fact, might cause it ultimately to burst,\" Higgins said.

        "content": "Investors looking to exceed the returns of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 may want to start their search with hypergrowth tech stocks. The tech sector is filled with corporations that have outperform the stock market over many years. Some of those stocks have matured but others can keep going.\n\nWhile mega-cap stocks have proven track records, smaller tech companies can also tap into hypergrowth and reward long-term investors. If you’re looking for promising hypergrowth tech stocks, you may want to take a closer look at these top picks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best hypergrowth tech stocks in the market and is a staple in many mutual funds and ETFs. The tech giant is up by 63% over the past year and surged by 276% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s main growth engine is still churning along at a nice pace. Microsoft Cloud revenue was up by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24. Overall revenue was up by 18% year-over-year while net income increased by 33% year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud makes up more than half of the company’s total revenue. However, the firm has exposure to other exciting verticals like gaming, business software, and artificial intelligence. Microsoft has made big investments in the latter and is positioning itself as one of the leaders in the industry.\n\nMicrosoft also offers a dividend yield which stands at 0.72%. The company has regularly increased its dividend by 10% or more each year.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a fintech company that has a large percentage of the credit and debit card market. The company earns revenue on every Visa credit or debit card transaction. And many investors use this stock as a bellwether to measure the economy’s strength.\n\nVisa’s latest financial report pointed to resilient consumer spending. Revenue increased by 9% year-over-year while net income was up by 17% year-over-year. Visa is a stable company that has delivered reliable returns and financial growth over the years. Shares have recorded a 1-year gain of 27% and a 5-year gain of 92%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also has a dividend yield hovering above 0.70%. The company recently hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.52 per share. That’s a 15.4% year-over-year increase. Visa should continue to perform well as consumer spending rises. Even if people have to cut back on purchases, most of them will still use credit cards due to the great reward programs.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has produced millionaires thanks to an AI-fueled rally. Shares are up by 244% over the past year and have gained more than 2,000% over the past five years\n\nUnlike most AI stocks, Nvidia is living up to the hype. The company posted another dominant quarter which featured 265% year-over-year revenue growth and 491% year-over-year net income growth. Those growth rates help support the recent stock price movement and give the rally a better foundation.\n\nNvidia only trades at 34x forward earnings. The company’s significant net income growth makes the valuation easier to justify and presents an opportunity. Despite massive gains already, Nvidia still has room to run.\n\nThe company’s rapid growth and excitement around the stock create the possibility of it becoming the largest publicly traded corporation. Nvidia shares have to gain an additional 50% from current levels to reach that milestone. It may not happen right away, but the string of “Buy” ratings suggest that Nvidia can eventually become a more valuable company than Microsoft.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s easy to forget how well-run Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) main revenue drivers are. The corporation is behind in the artificial intelligence race but is still the leading advertising giant. Alphabet has significantly increased net profit margins due to its cost-cutting measures, and the latest earnings report put those efforts on full display.\n\nAlphabet grew its revenue by 13% year-over-year and increased net income by 52% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company’s net profit margin rose to 24.0%.\n\nThe advertising network and Google Cloud continue to perform well. More advertisements related to the Olympic Games and the Election will help Alphabet report higher earnings. Net profits should grow at a faster rate than revenue and lead to higher profit margins.\n\nDespite having a strong business model, many investors are fixated on the company’s recent AI blunders. The stock offers a generous 25 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and has still outperformed the market. Shares are up by 47% over the past year and have gained 142% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the other leading advertising giant. After a strong resurgence in 2023 centered around cost-cutting and a return to revenue growth, the company continued its rally into 2024.\n\nResults from the fourth quarter of 2023 suggest the company can connote to reward investors. During that quarter, revenue increased by 25% year-over-year while net income surged by 201% year-over-year. Full year revenue was up by 16% year-over-year while full year net income increased by 69% year-over-year. Meta Platforms is accelerating its growth rates leading into a year that normally sees more demand for advertisements.\n\nThe company also achieved impressive growth rates for its social networks. Daily active users increased by 8% year-over-year while monthly active users were up by 6% year-over-year.\n\nFacebook drove impressive growth, but other social networks within the Meta Platforms umbrella performed even better. The company even announced a $0.50 dividend. Meta Platforms will likely have many years of 10%+ year-over-year dividend increases for its new program.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) has everything going for it except its valuation. Investors who are willing to wait a few years for the valuation to become more reasonable may benefit from adding a small position. Waiting for a dip is also a great choice.\n\nThe educational app has experienced high revenue growth for many years. The company continued with that trend by reporting 45% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Daily active users and monthly active users were also up by impressive numbers.\n\nThe big story for this stock was the dramatic surge in net income. Duolingo reported $12.1 million in net income which was a big turnaround from a $13.9 million net loss in the same period last year. Duolingo made the switch to profitability earlier in 2023, but this quarter demonstrates how quickly profit margins are expanding.\n\nHigher profit margins can result in a lower valuation and make sure look like a bargain in a few years for investors who accumulate positions now. However, the stock currently has a 141 forward P/E ratio. You’ll have to keep that in mind before buying this educational tech company.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a fintech company that has many software products under its umbrella. The corporation owns Turbotax, Quickbooks, Mailchimp, and other resources. The stock has consistently outperformed the market and has gained 171% over the past five years. The company is also up by 63% over the past year.\n\nIntuit once again reported revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company’s $3.4 billion in revenue was 11% higher than the same period last year. However, investors got more excited about the company more than doubling its revenue year-over-year. The significant growth brought the stock’s forward P/E ratio to 41.\n\nIntuit is still growing at a respectable pace and offers vital tools with monthly subscription plans. Many taxpayers use the company’s tools to make the tax season less stressful. In addition, many companies rely on Mailchimp to communicate with their audiences.\n\nAnalysts are also feeling optimistic about the stock. The fintech company has a “Strong Buy” rating from 22 analysts and an average price target that indicates more upside from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, NVDA, and GOOG.

        "title": "VUG vs. VGT: Which Tech-Heavy ETF Is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "ETFs allow investors to diversify their capital without much effort. Fund managers either take an active approach and carefully monitor individual positions or align their funds with established benchmarks. Vanguard is one of the leading firms that specializes in these types of funds. This article will dive into two popular Vanguard funds, one of which is tech-heavy, while the other is tech-exclusive: the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).\n\nI am bullish on both of these funds, but it’s important to know the nuances of each fund before getting started. This article will examine their similarities and differences so you can decide which one makes sense for you.\n\nBoth Funds Have Performed Well in the Long Term\n\nBoth of these funds have been neck-and-neck over the past year. VGT is up by 48.2%, while VUG has gained 47.8%. There is a larger gap between the funds when looking at five-year performances. While VGT gained 166.1% during that time, VUG was only up by 121.6%.\n\nEven though VGT has been the clear winner over the past five years, it’s hard to complain about the performance of either of these funds.\n\nInvestors don’t even have to worry much about these funds’ expense ratios eating away the returns. Vanguard is well-known for having low expense ratios for its funds, and the brokerage firm certainly delivers for these picks. VUG has a 0.04% expense ratio, while VGT has a 0.10% expense ratio.\n\nHow Much Do You Like Microsoft and Apple?\n\nThere’s more to VUG and VGT than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, these two stocks are the largest positions in both funds by wide margins.\n\nVUG offers more portfolio diversification for assets outside of these two tech giants. Microsoft makes up 13.2% of the fund’s total holdings, while Apple consists of 12.2% of the fund’s total assets. More than a quarter of VUG’s total holdings are in those two stocks.\n\nVGT is even more lopsided toward those tech conglomerates. The fund has 20.5% of its total assets in Microsoft and puts 20.2% of its capital into Apple. Those two stocks make up more than 40% of VGT’s total holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nVUG has the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven within its top 10 holdings. However, VGT deviates from this trend. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the only other Magnificent Seven stock within the fund’s top 10 holdings, as you can see below.\n\nVUG Has Been Catching Up\n\nWhile the five-year returns imply VGT is the better pick, this is a classic case of past results not guaranteeing future success. Although VGT has a big lead for that time horizon, VUG has outperformed it over the past six months. VUG is also the year-to-date winner, with a 10.5% return compared to VGT’s 8.6% return.\n\nI believe this trend will continue for a few reasons. The first reason is Apple stock. Although shares are up by 320% over the past five years, they are only up by 14.4% over the past year. Apple stock is actually down by 4% over the past six months.\n\nMore than 20% of VGT’s portfolio is down by 4% over the past six months. That distinction only applies to roughly 12% of VUG’s total portfolio. Now, Apple can turn things around if the Vision Pro becomes the next big product, and I believe that product has the potential to deliver great returns. However, the rest of the company’s growth slowed down significantly and offers very limited upside other than the Vision Pro.\n\nAnother big reason VUG looks more enticing is the portfolio composition. With Apple’s growth slowing, investors have to pay more attention to the other stocks in these funds’ portfolios. While both funds have Nvidia as their third largest holding, the funds deviate from there.\n\nVUG takes the expected approach of loading up on the Magnificent Seven stocks. That’s proven to be a good long-term decision, and those corporations have plenty of runway, excluding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) for now.\n\nI also have an issue with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) being VGT’s 9th largest holding. That stock makes up 1.56% of the fund’s total assets but hasn’t budged by much over the years.\n\nCisco stock is down by 6% over the past five years. While its dividend puts the investment in the positive, that’s not the pick you want to see in a growth fund’s portfolio. VGT has better five-year returns, but I believe VUG is poised to perform better over the next five years.\n\nIs VUG Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nVUG is rated as a Strong Buy based on 172 Buys, 35 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average VUG stock price target of $378.47 implies 12.5% upside potential.\n\nIs VGT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nMeanwhile, VGT is rated as a Moderate Buy, with 231 Buys, 76 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VGT stock price target of $575.87 implies 11.5% upside potential. Nonetheless, analysts’ ratings suggest VUG will continue to extend its recent lead.\n\nThe Bottom Line on VUG vs. VGT\n\nComparing stock charts doesn’t always yield the correct answer of which fund is the better pick. That seems to be the case with these funds. VGT has the better five-year returns but was more reliant on Apple’s ascent. VUG still has significant exposure to Apple but is better prepared for a slowdown in that stock.\n\nIf Apple’s Vision Pro turns the stock into a winner again, VGT will outperform VUG, but that’s not guaranteed to happen. Both of these funds are heavily dependent on Microsoft and Apple, but it looks like VUG has better top 10 holdings than VGT.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today",
        "content": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Are Getting Obliterated Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell 6.8% in the afternoon session after stocks declined, with investors likely taking profits. The Nasdaq fell 1.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.9%. Some of the big tech names felt the heat, with Tesla, Netflix, and Microsoft all declining by more than 2%. Notably, iPhone manufacturer Apple was also down nearly 3% following a research report by Counterpoint that suggested a decline in iPhone sales in China in the first six weeks of the year. The weak demand report could signal that the purchasing power of consumers in the region is weakening. Otherwise, we have found no other fundamental or rate-related reasons explaining the broad market decline.\n\nIt is a week packed with information for investors to digest. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will give updates to Congress on March 6th and 7th, 2024, about the current monetary outlook, recent policy actions, and progress toward bringing inflation back down. Finally, on March 8th, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payrolls for the month of February. The insight gleaned from the economic data and updates during the week could inform the market's outlook on equities and other assets for better or worse. Investors expect the Fed to begin cutting rates this year, with the expectation of the first rate cut as early as the first half of the year.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 16 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 12 days ago, when the company gained 5.8% as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results.\n\nDuring its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications. Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 18.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $291.93 per share it is still trading 12.7% below its 52-week high of $334.55 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,034.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "content": "The stock market offers many opportunities for people who want to become millionaires. Investments in corporations can grow much faster than the funds in a savings account. Some stocks can soar quickly to the point where you can retire off of them.\n\nInvestors have seen this happen firsthand with several stocks. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are two successful stocks that come to mind. These stocks have exceptional 5-year gains, but some investors may believe they have missed out on those opportunities.\n\nHowever, if you expand your time horizons and focus on reliable companies, it’s possible to become a 401k millionaire. Let’s examine three retirement stocks that can help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) makes money every time its customers use their credit and debit cards. The company has established a robust business model and is poised to become a $1 trillion company within a few years. Currently, the stock has a $570 billion market cap and is up by more than 90% over the past five years.\n\nTruly, Visa benefits from rising consumer spending. If the economy is healthy, Visa will continue to deliver good results as it did in Q1 2024. During that quarter, revenue increased by 9% year over year (YOY) while net income jumped by 17% YOY.\n\nThose growth rates help support a dividend program that exhibits meaningful dividend hikes each year. While the 0.73% yield is low, Visa raised its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.52 per share in 2023. The company has regularly maintained a double-digit growth rate each year and has more than doubled its dividend from 2019 to 2023.\n\nInvestors planning for retirement don’t have to focus on current yields. The high cash flow is likely to be there by the time you need to use this stock to fund your living expenses. In the meantime, Visa’s stock price stands to grow in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers great value for investors as a company that seems as if it’s doing everything right for its business. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot sector, and Microsoft recently doubled down by introducing Copilot for Finance. It’s part of the company’s continued efforts to become an AI leader within the industry.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft is far more than an AI stock. The corporation has exposure to many verticals, but none of them are as important as Microsoft Cloud. This business segment made up $33.7 billion of the company’s $62.0 billion in Q2 FY24 revenue. Also, Microsoft Cloud revenue was up by 24% YOY and helped the company grow by 18% YOY.\n\nThat’s an impressive growth rate for a large tech company. Net income followed with a 33% YOY improvement. Microsoft will be around for many years and continually expanding into additional industries as opportunities arise. The company is well-run, and just like Visa, it offers a low dividend yield with a high annual growth rate.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) isn’t going anywhere. The retailer offers affordable products, and lower prices will always be a big draw. Investors pouring money into their 401k plans want stability and the confidence that their money will grow. Walmart checks off both requirements.\n\nRecently, the company posted 5.7% YOY revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. In a show of confidence, Walmart also hiked its annual dividend by 9%. While most people know the company for its retail, a few segments stand out.\n\nAnd, e-commerce sales increased by 23% YOY which will help the company take some market share from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Furthermore, the company’s global advertising business grew by an impressive 33% YOY. Finally, Walmart’s recent acquisition of Vizio will help its ad segment.\n\nCurrently, WMT trades at a 31 P/E ratio. Shares have gained 25% over the past year and are up by 81% over the past five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "title": "Seize the Surge: Why Investors Can’t Ignore Small Caps, AI and Consumer Confidence Right Now",
        "content": "In a previous column, published on Feb. 28, I predicted that medium-cap and small-cap stocks would surge, powered by their “favorable fundamentals and low valuations.” Last week, the latter process did indeed occur to a very large extent. Meanwhile, boding well for the tech sector. the artificial intelligence boom is spreading to many more stocks. And in a phenomenon that’s lifting many consumer discretionary equities, investors’ confidence in the economy appears to be rapidly improving. All in all, it does appear that investors are becoming much more optimistic, in line with the view that the well-known stock picker, Ken Fisher, has shared about the market’s current status.\n\nFinally but importantly, it appears that the Federal Reserve remains open to cutting interest rates later this year. This is an important consideration for investors who invest in small-cap stocks.\n\nSmall-Cap and Medium-Cap Stocks Rallied\n\nThe Russell 2000, which is made up of small and medium names, jumped by an impressive total of nearly 3% last week. The huge increase shows that my thesis about those names is indeed playing out. The surge also indicates that many more investors, per my long-held thesis, are realizing that elevated interest rates do not constitute certain for the vast majority of small and medium companies. Indeed, even the most currently unprofitable firms with powerful competitive advantages can overcome high rates. That’s because, as former FDIC head Sheila Bair has said, “Truly promising innovations will (always) attract capital,” even when interest rates are relatively high.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs more investors internalize the latter points, the demand for the shares of medium and small companies will surge, causing many of the bears who believed in the ill-fated “rates are everything for these companies” thesis to cover their positions. Consequently, I continue to believe that a high proportion of these stocks will indeed undergo huge short-covering rallies in the medium-to-long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Tech Sector Is Getting Big Boosts\n\nMany investors are starting to realize that the positive AI boom will not be limited to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and a few other chip makers.\n\nFurthering this revelation, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), previously seen as an unexciting tech “dinosaur,” delivered much better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on March 1. The firm’s strong report was driven by “high demand for its artificial intelligence-optimized servers,” Seeking Alpha explained. In the wake of Dell’s strong numbers, its shares catapulted a huge 31.6% higher on March 1.\n\nFollowing Dell’s results, other, old-time tech hardware makers rose meaningfully, with HP (NYSE:HPQ) advancing 3.8%, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) climbing 3.5% (including after-hours action), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) advancing 8%.\n\nAlso causing investors to look more positively on hardware makers was S&P Global’s decision, announced after the market closed on March 1, to invite another server maker, Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI), to join the S&P 500. After jumping 4.5% during the regular session, SMCI stock climbed another 12.5% on the news of its accession to the index.\n\nFinally, Nvidia’s investments in two startups that utilize AI in healthcare should boost the share prices of many other start-ups that are using AI in major fields. And NVDA’s investment in SoundHoundAI (NASDAQ:SOUN), a relatively small company whose technology allows AI systems to more quickly respond to human voices, should increase investors’ faith in small firms developing AI technology. This bodes well for small-cap stocks.\n\nConsumer Discretionary Names, the State of the Market, and the Fed’s Outlook\n\nWith the labor market and consumer spending staying strong, fears of a recession are rapidly dissipating among investors while most consumer discretionary firms have been reporting strong quarterly results. The latter trends, in turn, are benefiting many stocks within the sector. As evidence of that assertion, consider that the Vanguard Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA:VCR) rose nearly 10% between Jan 31 and March 1. As investors’ attitudes about the economy continue to improve, consumer discretionary stocks should keep performing very well going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market as a whole keeps delivering outstanding returns. Over the month that ended in March, for example, the S&P 500 rose 3.6%, while the index advanced 11.8% in the three months that terminated on the same data. As a result, I continue to agree with Ken Fisher’s recent assertion that we’re in the early stages of the “optimism” part of John Templeton’s famous description of the progression of bull markets. Specifically, Templeton said, “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die of euphoria.”\n\nFinally, the Fed looks poised to feed that optimism, as two Fed members, Tom Barkin and Austan Goolsbee, remained open to cutting rates later this year. Barkin said “I’m still hopeful inflation is going to come down and if inflation normalizes then it makes the case for why you want to normalize rates.”\n\nGoolsbee was more optimistic, stating that inflation looks poised to fall further, while “rates are pretty restrictive” already. Given these comments, it’s clear that Goolsbee expects to support considerable rate cuts later this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in SMCI.

        "title": "Qualcomm CEO touts company's generative AI opportunity during annual shareholder meeting",
        "content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon took the virtual stage during his company’s annual shareholder’s meeting on Tuesday to tout the chip giant’s AI efforts. Qualcomm’s processors are found in millions of Android-powered smartphones around the world, and its latest, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, is meant to power on-device generative AI apps.\n\n“We are bringing Gen AI capabilities to smartphone users worldwide,” Amon said in his prepared remarks. “Our leadership in premium- and high-tier Android devices continues with our latest Snapdragon mobile platforms, which now feature significantly enhanced AI processing performance,” he added.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is found in Samsung’s latest Galaxy S24 line of smartphones and helps process some of its on-board generative AI features including photo editing tools like Samsung’s Generative Edit, which allows you to quickly erase or move subjects in your shots.\n\nThe company is also aiming to take on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI PC space. All four chip companies aspire to be the go-to company for on-device generative AI applications for laptops and desktops. Intel’s Core Ultra chips are already on the market and available in high-end laptops from the likes of HP, Dell, and others, while Nvidia says computers with its graphics chips can be considered AI PCs. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon speaks during a presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Feb. 25, 2024. (PAU BARRENA/AFP via Getty Images) (PAU BARRENA via Getty Images)\n\nQualcomm will release its Snapdragon X Elite chip in the coming months, but the company already claims that the processor outmatches Intel’s offering in AI workloads.\n\n“The Snapdragon X Elite — our first implementation of the custom Qualcomm Oryon CPU — features industry-leading AI performance and significant improvements in performance and battery life,” Amon said. “It is poised to set the industry benchmark for on-device Gen AI and Copilot experiences.”\n\nThe majority of the generative AI experiences most people use are still processed in the cloud including ChatGPT, Microsoft’s various Copilots, and Google’s Gemini platform. But as generative AI models become more specialized for certain tasks, the thinking goes, on-device processing will become the go-to means of interacting with the technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nChip companies also say on-device generative AI applications will be more secure because you won’t have to send out your data over the web. But so far, there aren’t many onboard generative AI apps for the average consumer.\n\nGenerative AI is seen as a potential means of boosting smartphone and PC sales at a time when the markets for both devices are trying to return to solid growth following a major slowdown after a huge sales increase in the early days of the pandemic. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, while shares of Nvidia and AMD have benefited handsomely from the generative AI boom, Qualcomm hasn’t seen the same outsized reaction. Shares of the company are up 33% over the last 12 months, which is impressive, but nowhere near AMD’s 107% or Nvidia’s incredible 226%. Even Intel shares have outperformed Qualcomm’s, rising 48% during the same period.\n\nThat said, the market for on-device generative AI is still in its early stages, and if apps do begin to take off, Qualcomm could find itself in an especially strong position given its reach.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "This Phenomenal Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Turned $100,000 Into More Than $600,000. Could It Do It Again?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a hot investment area, and investors are betting on tomorrow's winners. This has driven shares of technology companies active in this space to double- and triple-digit gains -- and helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 recently reach record highs.\n\nWhy so much excitement? AI has the potential to save companies time and money -- and lead to major progress in game-changing areas like personalized medicine or autonomous vehicle technology. In fact, some analysts predict the AI market will surpass $1 trillion by the end of this decade. That means investors who bet on tomorrow's AI leaders today could win big.\n\nSome early investors in AI stocks already have benefited, and that brings me to the subject of one of today's most exciting AI players: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Investors who put $100,000 into that stock just three years ago have seen the value of that investment soar to more than $600,000. But the question now is whether this exciting AI stock could do this again -- or are Nvidia's biggest gains a thing of the past? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's 500% gain\n\nNvidia clearly has been a profitable investment recently, gaining more than 500% over the past three years. Seeing the momentum in everything related to AI, this is no surprise. After all, Nvidia is the leading maker of chips that power one of the most important actions in the field of AI, and that's \"deep learning.\" This involves the pouring of enormous amounts of data into AI models so that they then can solve complex problems and carry out a broad range of tasks.\n\nTo drive this learning process, speed is crucial, and that's where Nvidia's chips come in. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the fastest on the market by far, making them a top choice of the world's major technology companies that are building AI models -- for example, Meta Platforms recently said it aims to have 350,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs on board by the end of the year. And server giant Super Micro Computer works hand in hand with Nvidia, following its product development so that Supermicro can adapt its own products to include Nvidia's latest releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are just a couple of examples, but they illustrate the strength of Nvidia in the AI market.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia doesn't only design chips -- but it also offers a broad range of products and services, such as its software platform, which supports its clients in the development and deployment of AI systems. All this should help Nvidia keep its leading spot in the AI market and power more growth down the road.\n\nNow, let's get back to our question: Could Nvidia stock once again advance in the triple digits over the coming years and drive major gains for investors? A triple-digit gain would bring Nvidia to about $2,000 a share from today's level of a little more than $800, which would bring the company's market value to $5 trillion. That's up from a market cap of about $2 trillion today and would surpass today's biggest company, Microsoft, which is valued at $3 trillion.\n\nTriple-digit earnings growth\n\nAll of this is possible from a mathematical angle -- if Nvidia keeps up the tremendous pace of earnings growth we've seen in recent quarters. In the fourth quarter, revenue and net income advanced in the triple digits, thanks to AI-related demand.\n\nNvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang says the industry transition to accelerated computing from general computing and the use of generative AI are making \"conditions excellent for continued growth.\"\n\nGrowth drivers lie ahead, too: Nvidia is in the early days of its revenue growth story in the software business, and the company's increasing research and development spending could cement leadership in GPUs and beyond.\n\nOf course, placing a $100,000 bet on any one company is highly risky, so if you have this amount to invest, you're better off spreading it across a selection of quality companies. This will limit your losses if one particular stock doesn't perform as well as you'd hoped.\n\nBut within your investing budget, whether it's small or large, Nvidia still makes a great investment today -- thanks to its market leadership, broad range of products and services, and investment in R&D, this tech giant could keep on growing, and even deliver another triple-digit gain down the road.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Palantir or SoundHound AI?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) took the investing world by storm. Let's be real. Is there a lot of hype? Sure. Will many of the current hot names end up in the dustbin of history? Probably. But will AI have a huge impact on productivity and the economy and create long-term winning stocks? Absolutely! The key is not to put every egg in one basket and choose investments intelligently. As Peter Lynch (one of the most successful investors ever) said, \"Know what you own and why you own it.\"\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) and SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) are two hugely popular names. SoundHound stock exploded on the news that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has a small stake. Palantir proved many skeptics wrong by posting five straight quarters of net income in accord with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). I'll explore both companies below.\n\nIs Palantir a good stock to buy?\n\nPalantir is one of the original AI names. The stock is also a lighting rod for investors after its 2021 rise and 2022 fall, as shown below.\n\nIt has surged again as the AI wave and the company's performance heats up. Palantir helps businesses and governments (defense departments) manage the massive amounts of data they generate. It's one thing to have tons of data, but it's of little use if the organization cannot visualize, analyze, and act on it. This is where Palantir's platforms come in.\n\nFor instance, one of its platforms, Gotham, harnesses AI to analyze information in real time for defense and intelligence agencies. Palantir Foundry provides deep insights and analysis for the private sector. Palantir's newest product, aptly named the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), is deployable commercially and for defense. Check out this article for a real-world example of how AIP is used.\n\nPalantir is putting to bed two criticisms. First, the company is entrenched in the defense industry but was slower to be commercially adopted. The commercial marketplace is enormous and crucial to growth. As shown below, commercial sales are taking off.\n\nStory continues Source: Palantir.\n\nThe U.S. commercial customer count rose 55% year-over-year as well. Total sales in the fourth quarter grew 20% to $608 million.\n\nThe second challenge for Palantir was becoming GAAP profitable. The company was widely criticized for its liberal use of stock-based compensation, which kept the bottom line in the red for years and diluted shareholders. Q4 was the fifth straight profitable quarter and the largest profit in Palantir's history at $93 million.\n\nThe stock trades for 25 times sales at the moment -- not cheap, but few stocks are in this market. Accumulating shares slowly allows investors to take advantage of dips. Palantir is a larger, more stable, and more profitable company than SoundHound, so it is more appropriate for investors with medium risk tolerance.\n\nIs SoundHound a good investment?\n\nSoundHound AI is a much smaller company than Palantir ($17 million in sales in Q4 compared to $608 million), which means more potential for massive gains but significantly more risk and volatility.\n\nYou may have noticed more and more AI voice recognition software taking your order at drive-thru and fast-casual restaurants. The voice assistants in vehicles are also becoming more \"intelligent.\" Many of these use SoundHound technology. Then SoundHound makes revenue from licensing and subscriptions. The addressable market is vast, with additional opportunities in retail, customer service, appointment scheduling, etc. The advantages for businesses in terms of efficiency are huge, and this will drive sales and adoption.\n\nSoundHound's Q4 sales were up 80% year-over-year, and its operating leverage improved significantly, although the company is still unprofitable and not quite cash-flow-positive. Still, market penetration is more critical to its success than profit at this stage. The company reported a cumulative order backlog of $661 million. If achieved, this is revenue that will be recognized over several years.\n\nEven since Nvidia's investment was reported (here's my take on that), the stock has been on a tear, as shown below. SOUN Chart\n\nAs you can see above, it trades at 42 times sales, but that changes quickly with this dynamic stock.\n\nWhich company is the better investment? It depends on the investor. Palantir is profitable, growing, and solid but less likely to go parabolic than SoundHound. SoundHound has tremendous potential but could falter as it is just beginning its journey.\n\nOf course, there's no rule that says you have to own just one (or either).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 5 Stock Recommendations.\n\nJim Cramer yet again grilled market naysayers in his latest program on CNBC, calling them “non-believers” who he believes only got encouraged by the recent market declines. Cramer said first the bears warned everyone about the inflationary cycle after the pandemic, then they “hated” the market amid the regional banking crisis, upping their calls for a hard landing following the Fed’s rate hikes.\n\nJim Cramer's Message to the \"Nonbelievers\"\n\nJim Cramer said all along these bears “failed to celebrate the market’s incredible victories” and they “ignored” the “end of high inflation.”\n\nJim Cramer also said that initially the market bears complained about the concentration of market gains in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, which include companies like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), but later ignored when the gains started to “bifurcate” to the broader market including small-cap and mid-cap stocks which Cramer believes are still “cheap.”\n\n“What the heck is wrong with these people,” Cramer said about market skeptics.\n\nIs AI a Bubble? Cramer's Take\n\nJim Cramer also said that while market doubters called AI a bubble, they ignored crypto which Cramer believes was an “obvious bubble.” Cramer said many believe crypto is a hedge against inflation but when inflation was very high crypto performed “horribly.”\n\nNonetheless Cramer admitted that crypto’s “relative worth” against the US dollar is “palpable” and it “makes sense” that people are investing in crypto ETFs to hedge against inflation.\n\nJim Cramer also talked about AI and how some people are calling it a bubble. Cramer said while there are some companies in the industry that are “over inflated” not all AI companies are bubbles. Cramer reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said the stock is undervalued. Cramer said you have to have a historical context to understand and analyze Nvidia. He said that last year NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was apparently overvalued based on the Wall Street’s earnings estimates. Cramer said the company’s 2024 earnings estimates set by Wall Street analysts are still low and that’s why he believes the stock has more room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It is undisputed that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the king of AI,” Cramer said.\n\nIn the end, Cramer recommended investors to build up their cash piles and be ready to buy when there’s a pullback. Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Stock Recommendations\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched the latest 'Lightning Round' segments of Jim Cramer's recent programs and picked 11 stocks he recommended investors. For each stock we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, courtesy of Insider Monkey's database of 933 funds and their holdings. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nJim Cramer has been bullish on Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) in the past but recently he called the huge runup in the stock price of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) a sign of market “froth.” However, during his latest Lightning Round program on CNBC Cramer recommended investors to buy “some” Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) stock right now and wait for the lockup expiration period to buy some more. Cramer thinks Softbank would sell Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares on lockup expiration and said that would the “best” time to buy the stock.\n\n10. Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nIT consulting company Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) ranks 10th in our list of Jim Cramer’s latest stock recommendations. Cramer called Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) a “smart consulting company.” Cramer said he “discovered” Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) and found that they are based in India and realized that Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) is a “great way to do business.” Cramer said he “likes” the stock.\n\nA total of 22 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds had stakes in Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) as of the end of 2023.\n\nLike Infosys, Cramer also loves Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n9. Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nJim Cramer recently said during his program that Signet Jewelers Ltd's (NYSE:SIG) CEO Virginia C. Drosos has been doing a “remarkable job.” Cramer said she is just changing the stores “radically.” Cramer said the stock’s multiple is way too low as people are “well behind.”\n\n“You’ve got a winner here,” Cramer said of Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 25 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG). The most significant stake in Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) is owned by Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group which owns a $798 million stake in Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG).\n\n8. TransMedics Group, Inc (NASDAQ:TMDX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nOrgan transplant solutions company TransMedics Group, Inc (NASDAQ:TMDX) received positive comments from Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC. Cramer said this organic transplant company is “very important” and TransMedics Group, Inc (NASDAQ:TMDX) “did have good numbers.” Cramer also said that “these guys are doing well.”\n\nLast month TransMedics Group, Inc (NASDAQ:TMDX) posted fourth quarter results. GAAP EPS in the fourth quarter came in at $0.12, beating estimates by $0.16. Revenue in the quarter jumped 158.6% year over year to $81.2 million, surpassing estimates by $12.7 million.\n\n7. Amkor Technology (NYSE:AMKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nSemiconductor company Amkor Technology (NYSE:AMKR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bullish on in 2024. Cramer said “you’ve got a winner” about Amkor Technology (NYSE:AMKR) and said that Amkor Technology (NYSE:AMKR) is “into growth.”\n\nIn its latest earnings call Amkor management talked about how AI is affecting demand:\n\n\"To support the strong demand for AI devices we doubled capacity exiting 2023 and with our planned investments coming online in the second quarter of 2024, we will have more than tripled our capacity compared to the second quarter of 2023. We expect the 2.5D demand will continue to increase in 2024, and we plan to support our customers in line with market growth. The consumer end-market declined 38% for the full year. Multiple headwinds including reduced consumer spending, excess inventory, and product changeovers in the IoT wearable market and drove the decline. Within consumer, we support a broad portfolio of solutions for IoT wearables, as well as the traditional consumer products. We are engaged in the next-generation products with our lead customers that will ramp production in the course of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, our manufacturing organization focused on optimizing capacity for 2.5D technology in Korea, and on qualifying advanced SiP and memory technology in Vietnam.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer called Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) a “winner” in one of his latest programs like it was a no-brainer. Cramer said the reason why Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) does not receive a lot of attention is because it’s a “very boring company.” Cramer said this is an inexpensive stock and reiterated that he thinks the stock is a “winner.”\n\nCommercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) shares have gained about 5% in 2024 so far through March 5.\n\nDuring its latest earnings call the company talked about guidance:\n\n\"We expect shipment volumes within our North America Steel Group to decline sequentially due to normal seasonality during the winter months. Margins on steel products are likely to experience some further compression during the second quarter. However, recent price announcements on rebar, merchant bar, and wire rod should support an inflection point in the coming months. Downstream product margins should exhibit good stability sequentially. Conditions in Europe are expected to remain challenging, but adjusted EBITDA excluding energy rebates should improve from the levels of the past two quarters. Financial results for our Emerging Businesses Group are anticipated to follow a typical seasonal pattern with some slowing of activity in Q2.\n\nLooking beyond the second quarter, which is CMC’s seasonally slowest period, we expect robust spring and summer construction activity driven by the increased impact of rising infrastructure investment, which should support an already healthy demand backdrop. Both the North America Steel Group and the Emerging Businesses Group should benefit from anticipated strong activity levels. Regarding the Europe Steel Group, supply-side adjustments and the impact of increasing levels of residential and infrastructure construction should drive sequential improvement in financial results beginning with the spring construction season.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nIn addition to Commercial Metals, Jim Cramer is also bullish on  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 5 Stock Recommendations.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "5 Crypto Stocks to Gain From as Bitcoin Soars Past $65,000",
        "content": "On Mar 4, Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $65,000, hitting a two-year high and nearing its all-time high achieved in 2021. The world’s largest cryptocurrency had hit a record high of $68,999.99 in November 2021.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market witnessed a solid 2023. The rally has continued into this year and chances are that Bitcoin may hit a new record high in the coming days. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has surged more than 54.5% year to date and 21% in the past week.\n\nThe recent surge in cryptocurrency prices follows the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early January.\n\nThe green light for 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs opened doors for larger investors, sparking renewed enthusiasm and momentum among them.\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF was given to integrate cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, offering sustained support to the crypto space in the long term.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency prices experienced a decline in the days following the SEC approval, it appears that the intended impact is now manifesting.\n\nAccording to data from LSEG, in the week ending Mar 1, net flows into the 10 largest U.S. spot bitcoin funds reached $2.17 billion, with more than 50% of the total allocated to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nAlso, the upcoming halving event for Bitcoin in April will reduce the mining reward for new blocks by half. Historically, this event has heightened scarcity, making it challenging for miners to achieve a net increase in Bitcoins. Typically, Bitcoin's value experiences an upward surge due to the constrained supply during such periods.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 79.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 17.5% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. BLK is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the last 60 days. BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 132.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 42.9% over the last 60 days. Robinhood Markets currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nCME Group Inc.’s CME options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 2.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% over the last 60 days. CME presently has a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nVisa Inc. V is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain. This expansion of V includes collaboration with prominent merchant acquirers Worldpay and Nuvei, marking a pivotal development in the world of digital payments.\n\nVisa Inc.’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12.9%.

        "title": "1 Top AI Stock to Buy Before 2025 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "No company has seen a greater benefit from the artificial intelligence boom than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Training massive large-language models and running them requires gargantuan computing capacity. Nvidia's data center GPUs are the gold standard in the AI industry, and they're being scooped up by cloud giants and AI start-ups alike.\n\nNvidia's revenue more than tripled in its most recent quarter thanks to incredible demand for its AI-centric GPUs, while adjusted earnings per share rose by nearly a factor of six. Nvidia's market capitalization has surged to over $2 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nWhy Nvidia stock may not be the best AI bet\n\nWhile Nvidia is riding high right now, competition is almost guaranteed to eat away at the company's AI market share. Advanced Micro Devices is now putting up a fight with its own high-powered AI chips, and major tech and cloud computing companies are increasingly designing custom AI chips optimized for their data centers.\n\nAmazon has developed multiple AI chips: Inferentia for AI inference and Trainium for AI training. Alphabet's Google is on the fifth generation of its tensor processing unit, or TPU, with the company rolling out a version optimized for AI large models late last year. Meta is reportedly working on a custom AI chip to help power its massive AI ambitions. Microsoft unveiled its custom Maia 100 AI chip for its Azure cloud platform last year. It will initially be used to power the company's AI services, including Copilot and the OpenAI services running on Azure.\n\nWhile these mega-companies are still buying plenty of Nvidia's GPUs, options for training and running AI models are expanding. Nvidia's utter dominance of the AI chip market is almost certain to erode as time goes on.\n\nSomeone has to manufacture and package all those AI chips\n\nDesigning an AI chip is something that any large tech company with a big budget is capable of doing. Manufacturing those chips is another story. Today, there's only one viable option for manufacturing AI chips using the most advanced process. TSMC is the foundry market leader, and it has a significant technological lead over its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis situation is set to change in 2025 as Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) enters the foundry market in earnest. The chip giant has been executing its plan to roll out five new process nodes in four years, with the final node expected to overtake TSMC technologically. The Intel 18A process should be ready for volume production next year, and Intel has already snagged some important customers.\n\nIntel has secured $15 billion of orders for its foundry business so far, spanning not only Intel 18A but also other nodes as well as advanced packaging services. Nvidia is reportedly planning to use Intel for some of its advanced packaging needs, although that rumor hasn't been confirmed. A deal with Microsoft to use Intel 18A for an undisclosed future chip has been confirmed, representing a massive win for Intel's fledgling foundry business.\n\nBeyond Intel 18A, Intel has two additional processes on its roadmap meant to cement its manufacturing lead. Intel 14A is set to arrive in 2026, and Intel 10A will follow in 2027. Volume production of both processes will take time to ramp up following their introductions.\n\nA $230+ billion opportunity\n\nThe foundry market is expected to more than double by 2032 to surpass $230 billion. Intel's market share rounds down to zero today, but if it succeeds in regaining its manufacturing edge and ramping up the capacity of its leading nodes, the company can rapidly grow that market share over the next decade.\n\nIntel is valued at less than $200 billion today, with the stock still down significantly from its pandemic-era high. While Intel's core PC and server CPU businesses will remain key parts of the company, the foundry business has by far the best long-term growth potential.\n\nImportantly, Intel's foundry can succeed regardless of how the semiconductor and AI industries evolve. Do GPUs remain the dominant method to train and run AI models? Intel could potentially manufacture them. Do custom AI chips proliferate? Intel could manufacture those as well. What if demand for AI chips falls short of forecasts? Intel can manufacture other types of chips destined for the data center, smartphones, PCs, and other devices.\n\nWhile Nvidia is the AI darling today, it faces an onslaught of looming competition. That onslaught is good news for the foundry industry, and it's particularly good news for Intel as it aims to grow into the world's second-largest foundry by 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 4 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Are Brilliant Buys in March",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been some of the top performers in the market in recent years. This group consists of some of the largest companies listed in the U.S. markets. They are:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOf the seven, I think only four are great buys right now. So, where does the split occur?\n\nI'm not a buyer of these three right now\n\nMicrosoft and Apple are at the top of the list of those I'm passing on. Microsoft is excelling as a business, but the stock has gotten a bit pricey. Tipping the scales at 35 times forward earnings, Microsoft is one of the most expensive of the group that is optimized for profits.\n\nApple has struggled recently as its revenue shrank for four straight quarters before growing again in its latest quarter, but only by 2%.Apple's woes are expected to continue, as Wall Street analysts project 1.3% sales growth this fiscal year and 6.5% next year.\n\nThese two are at the bottom of my list, but the next stock is teetering on a buy.\n\nNvidia has been the best performer by far of the group, and there is a lot of hype built up in the stock. But that's for good reason. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, as highlighted by Nvidia's 265% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The stock is actually cheaper than Microsoft (33 times forward earnings), making it a potential buy.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't as tantalizing as the other four.\n\nThese four are much more attractive\n\nThat leaves Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms remaining as buys. All of these have different reasons to buy. For Amazon, its margins have been increasing thanks to the rise of its service divisions. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis has allowed its profits to climb dramatically alongside its rising revenue. Despite this success, it trades at its lowest price-to-sales ratio since 2020. This makes me confident that the best days are still ahead of Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has had its fair share of stumbles in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout, which hasn't helped the stock. But it's still a dominant power in advertising and cloud computing, which helped it grow its revenue by 13% in Q4. However, Alphabet is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at 20.3 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's cheaper than the 20.4 times forward earnings the S&P 500 trades at, making Alphabet a cheaper stock than the broader market. That's an absolute bargain, making it a fantastic buy.\n\nMeta Platforms has turned its business around after struggling in late 2022. Like Alphabet, its advertising wing has turned itself around, driving revenue growth of 25% in Q4. Wall Street analysts project another strong 2024, projecting 17% revenue growth. With the stock trading at 25 times forward earnings, it's not the cheapest, but it's still a solid buy at that price point.\n\nLastly is Tesla, which I may consider swapping with Nvidia. Tesla has been whacked since 2024 began, falling nearly 20%.\n\nSome of this concern comes from falling margins and slowing revenue growth. While this is a fair assessment, it also ignores some of the interest rate headwinds buyers are experiencing. Still, management was clear in the conference call that they're between growth waves, so this year may be tough.\n\nBut if you take the long-term view, Tesla's stock is the cheapest it has been in a year, although, at 63 times forward earnings, it's still pricey. If you've missed the Tesla boat, now might be a good time to hop in.\n\nWhile the Magnificent Seven stocks won't have the same performance they had in 2023 going forward, some are still strong buys and have market-beating potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Invested in This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company. Hint: It's Not SoundHound AI",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking the world by storm. The myriad applications the technology presents seem to evolve by the day. At the forefront of the AI revolution is semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) -- specialized chips used in accelerated computing and generative AI applications, such as machine learning and natural language processing.\n\nNvidia's products have been in high demand over the last year as AI became a more prominent fixture in IT budgets. For the 12 months ended Jan. 28, Nvidia generated $27 billion in free cash flow -- a more than sevenfold increase compared to the prior year.\n\nThe company is aggressively deploying its capital, and a new investment in robotics start-up Figure AI is Nvidia's latest move in its calculated chess game to outmaneuver the competition. Let's break down what Figure AI does and why Nvidia may be so keen to get involved in the emerging robotics market.\n\nWhat is Figure AI?\n\nFigure AI is a start-up that is developing humanoid robots. The company believes robotics will play a crucial role in automating everyday life. For example, robotics has the potential not only to disrupt the labor market but also to assist people in their homes with mundane tasks.\n\nLast week, reports broke that Figure AI raised $675 million in venture capital (VC) funding at a $2.6 billion valuation. If achieving unicorn status wasn't impressive enough, the company's backers are equally impressive. Participants in the fundraising included Microsoft, Jeff Bezos, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, OpenAI, and Nvidia.\n\nJeff Bezos, Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft, & Amazon are backing 'Figure AI', a start-up developing human-like robots, is raising $675M, valuing the company at ~$2B \r\n\r\nBezos contributes $100M, Microsoft $95M, with Nvidia and Amazon each investing $50M. @elonmuskpic.twitter.com/udATNvaQvS\n\n-- Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) February 23, 2024\n\n38 billion reasons to pay attention\n\nI'll concede that the idea of humanoid robots sits somewhere between The Jetsons and a sci-fi horror movie. But all jokes aside, Wall Street sees massive potential for this pocket of the AI market.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that the total addressable market for humanoid robots could be $38 billion by 2035. To put this into context, just a year ago, the bank estimated that the market size was $6 billion. Goldman cited faster-than-anticipated progress in large language models (LLM) and accelerated investments in AI as reasoning for the more bullish forecast.\n\nBut Goldman isn't the only one that sees multibillion-dollar potential here. On Figure AI's website, the company outlines that robots could disrupt the labor force in a meaningful way -- from industries including manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and retail. As robots help mitigate labor shortages, it could result in an enormous paradigm shift in the workforce by lowering the cost of goods and services.\n\nWhy might Nvidia be interested in robotics?\n\nI see a few reasons Nvidia may be interested in partnering with Figure AI. First, Nvidia's chips and its under-the-radar software business could play a crucial role in the further development of Figure AI bots.\n\nBut a more subtle reason for Nvidia's participation in the fundraise could be to simply acquire some exposure to an already established market. Humanoid robots are being developed by a host of companies -- you might just not realize it.\n\nMost prominently, Tesla has been teasing investors with a robot called Optimus, which it plans to use across its gigafactories and sell to consumers and businesses more broadly in the long term. And right behind Tesla is Boston Dynamics, the developer of the canine robot BigDog and humanoid bot Atlas.\n\nLastly, while Amazon and Alibaba currently leverage less-humanlike robots for their warehouses, the broader idea is that this technology has led to incredible efficiencies as it relates to shipping and labor costs. As investment in AI continues to build momentum, I would not be surprised to see companies in all different industries worldwide begin to integrate humanoid robotics into everyday operations.\n\nThe investment in Figure AI comes at the heels of another investment by Nvidia, this one in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI. While news of these deals is not a reason alone to buy Nvidia stock, it is fun to speculate what they could represent in the long run. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nI see the investment in Nvidia as an important move for the company as it seeks to move beyond GPUs. While its chip business will likely remain the bread and butter for the next few years, eventually, the competitive landscape will heat up, and Nvidia will need to demonstrate that it has other products and services it can market.\n\nI am excited to see where Nvidia can go in the long run, given the potential of humanoid robotics, the many different industries it could disrupt globally, and the company's potential to act as one of the primary engines powering this new technology.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Many investors wonder when a sell-off might occur with the market continually notching new highs. While I don't think it's in the cards just yet, it's good to be prepared if there is one.\n\nThis makes it easy to act when the market is falling, allowing you to quickly make decisions instead of needing to analyze. If there's a market sell-off, I'm buying these three stocks first.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFirst off is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), one of the hottest stocks in the market. Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are best in class for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, which has caused the company to grow dramatically over the past year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ending Jan. 28) alone, its revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion.\n\nBut the stock is pricey, trading at around 33 times forward earnings. So, if there's a market sell-off, there's a good chance this premium comes down. That would open the door for me to purchase the stock, as I've missed out on most of its performance.\n\nNvidia is operating in a massive market, with the global GPU market opportunity expected to reach $400 billion by 2032. So, while Nvidia would likely get hit hard in a sell-off, it will be fine over the long term.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) is not only my favorite cybersecurity stock, but it's the market's favorite as well. This has caused CrowdStrike's stock to become inflated, trading at 27 times sales. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nIf CrowdStrike could snap its fingers and become instantly profitable with a 30% profit margin, it would trade at 90 times earnings. That's more expensive than Nvidia, even from a hypothetical standpoint.\n\nCrowdStrike also has a massive market opportunity estimated at about $225 billion by 2028. With its annual recurring revenue rate rising 35% to $3.15 billion in Q3 FY 2024 (ending Oct. 31), it has a long way to go before saturating its market.\n\nI'm a huge fan of CrowdStrike as a business, but it's not a great buy at this price, so I'll wait until a sell-off occurs.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Costco\n\nSticking with the trend of great companies at expensive prices, Costco (NASDAQ: COST) fits this category. It's also a completely different investment style than the other two, being a commerce store.\n\nCostco has been a market-crushing investment for some time, thanks to its strong execution. Costco isn't going to light the world on fire with amazing growth, but it will consistently grow its earnings at a pace greater than 10% over the long term. COST EPS Basic (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nBy growing its earnings faster than the 10% threshold, Costco is well positioned to beat the market. But at 51 times trailing earning and 48 times forward earnings, it's unbelievably expensive and trades far above where it normally does. COST PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nIf Costco comes back down in a market pullback, I'll be sure to add more shares to my portfolio. Until then, I'll hold off because it's just too expensive to consider buying now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Mind-Blowing Quote That Shows Why This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock is a No-Brainer Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Signs of the new AI boom are suddenly everywhere again.\n\nAI stocks are soaring again this year as recent results from companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer have blown past analyst estimates as cloud infrastructure companies and AI start-ups dramatically ramp up spending on AI hardware. The fervor for AI stocks has gotten so heated that even stocks that Nvidia has invested in, like Soundhound AI, have surged when the news of Nvidia's stake broke.\n\nThose soaring stock prices have led some to fear that an AI bubble is forming. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel said that a speculative bubble could be starting in stocks like Nvidia, and other respected investors like Jeremy Grantham and Jeffery Gundlach have made similar proclamations.\n\nHowever, if you're questioning the magnitude and sustainability of the current wave of demand for AI infrastructure, this quote from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) founder Morris Chang should help convince you otherwise. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFabs and fabs and fabs\n\nAt a recent conference in Japan, Chang described the demand his company is seeing from customers for AI computing power, saying: \"They're not talking about tens of thousands of wafers. They are talking about fabs, [saying] 'We need so many fabs. We need three fabs, five fabs, 10 fabs.' Well, I can hardly believe that one.\"\n\nThe report, which was originally in Nikkei, said that Chang also said he believed demand was somewhere between tens of thousands of wafers and 10 fabs.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, you should know that it's the world's biggest contract manufacturer of semiconductors with more than 50% market share, and it has about 90% market share of advanced contract chip manufacturing, which has become even more in demand in the AI era. Taiwan Semi handles production for companies including Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and many others as most chip designers now outsource their manufacturing to foundries like Taiwan Semi.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven its tremendous market power, it's worth paying attention when its founder makes statements like the aforementioned one. Those sentiments also echo ones from other tech titans, including Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison, who has said that generative AI may be the most important new technology ever and said demand for AI computing power from Oracle was \"over the moon.\"\n\nThe meta picks-and-shovels AI play\n\nThe biggest winners in the AI boom so far are the picks-and-shovels plays like Nvidia. These are the companies supplying the key infrastructure needed to run AI applications and high-powered models like ChatGPT.\n\nIn many ways, this development is reminiscent of the early days of the internet and the dot-com boom, when the biggest winners were companies such as America Online and Netscape, which offered access to the internet and were the key building blocks of that era. Huge success stories such has Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms would come later.\n\nTaking that thinking one step further presents Taiwan Semi as something of a meta picks-and-shovels option in the AI boom, as it's as vital to the AI chipmakers like Nvidia as Nvidia is to the companies that need its GPUs and accelerators. That means that TSMC's competitive advantages are likely to expand as demand for AI chips builds.\n\nThe enormous demand that Taiwan Semi is seeing for new fabs won't be easy to fill. For example, building a state-of-the-art 3-nanometer fab, such as the ones in demand for AI chips, costs an estimated $20 billion, and plans for both TSMC and Intel to build new plants in the U.S. have run into snags. This shows that there are logistical and regulatory barriers standing in the way of expanding chip manufacturing capacity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis could be the easiest AI stock to own\n\nAs demand for AI chip manufacturing grows, TSMC occupies an increasingly enviable position, as it is by far the biggest manufacturing partner for industry suppliers like Nvidia. In some ways, it's the only game in town.\n\nTSMC's dominant market share at a crucial position in the AI supply chain also gives it significant market power, and it should be a winner no matter what happens in the AI revolution. The company only needs demand for chips to grow, and it's clear now that running generative AI applications comes with massive computing needs.\n\nTSMC won't have the kind of triple-digit breakout growth that Nvidia has experienced, as most of its demand is still for non-AI chips. But TSMC seems almost guaranteed to be a winner as AI demand grows, and the stock deserves a place in nearly any AI stock portfolio.\n\nShares of TSMC have already gained 29% this year after climbing 39% last year, and it's well positioned for further gains as it trades at a reasonable valuation and has a huge profit margin.\n\nAs that quote from Chang shows, TSMC's services are in demand as never before. If you're looking for an AI stock to buy right now, Taiwan Semi is a great place to start.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Every investor wants to find the next Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). For value-conscious investors, however, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) might actually be better than Nvidia in some ways. After all, QCOM stock allows you to participate in the artificial intelligence hardware market’s growth, but without chasing a stock that already went parabolic.\n\nWith Qualcomm stock you’ll get a decent dividend and exposure to a consistent earnings winner. So, consider adding a few Qualcomm shares to your portfolio before they explode higher like NVDA stock did.\n\nGo Global in 2024 With QCOM Stock\n\nTruly, Qualcomm’s presence has no boundaries. For example, Qualcomm is on the leading edge of emerging-market innovation with tech-ecosystem development initiatives in Vietnam, Taiwan and Africa.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm is partnering with logistics startup Airspace Technologies to expand its operations in Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore. Qualcomm is collaborating with German telecommunications firm Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS:DTEGY) to develop a “futuristic smartphone concept that relies on artificial intelligence rather than applications to handle users’ specific needs.”\n\nThe team-up with Deutsche Telekom should remind investors that Qualcomm is, indeed, immersed in the AI-hardware trend. Also on that topic, Qualcomm recently showcased new chips and AI models at a tech expo, the 2024 Mobile World Congress, in Spain.\n\nSure, Nvidia stock offers AI-technology exposure, but so does Qualcomm stock. In a recent interview, Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala strongly emphasized that the company’s chips will be “at the forefront” of AI and large language model deployment.\n\nQualcomm: An Earnings Winner That’s Not Overvalued\n\nPeople like to talk about Nvidia’s outstanding earnings results. What about Qualcomm, though? Qualcomm has a terrific track record of beating Wall Street’s quarterly EPS forecasts. Plus, the company’s results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 beat analysts’ consensustop-line and bottom-line estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it’s fine to allocate some of your capital toward Nvidia stock, you can also get into the AI-component industry with QCOM stock. Investing in Qualcomm is actually a better deal, in some ways. For example, while Nvidia offers a paltry forward annual dividend yield of 0.02%, Qualcomm’s yearly dividend yield is nearly 2%.\n\nThat’s great for passive-income investors, but what about value seekers? Qualcomm has something for just about everyone, as Qualcomm’s GAAP-measured trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 22.51x. For comparison, the sector median P/E ratio is 29.5x, and Nvidia’s P/E ratio is an eyebrow-raising 66.31x.\n\nQCOM Stock: Pair This Up With NVDA Stock\n\nThe point here isn’t to pit one stock against another stock. It’s actually not a terrible idea to own equal amounts of Nvidia stock and Qualcomm stock. Both companies are earnings winners in the AI-hardware sector.\n\nQualcomm is expanding its global footprint and offers an enticing value-and-yield combo. Investors should think about enhancing their NVDA stock holdings with a equal-sized allocation in QCOM stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Considerably Cheaper and Not in a Bubble",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, Wall Street has enjoyed no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Innovations and high-interest trends such as the advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, China stocks, 3-D printing, cannabis, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, have captivated the attention, and wallets, of professional and retail investors.\n\nAt the moment, nothing is garnering more hoopla than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say \"AI,\" I'm referring to the use of software and systems to handle tasks that humans would typically undertake. The secret sauce to AI is machine learning, which allows these software and system to evolve over time and become more efficient at their tasks. Given that AI has application in virtually every sector and industry, it's not really a surprise that the analysts at PwC anticipate it could add a staggering $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.\n\nAlthough dozens of AI stocks have benefited from the early stages of the AI revolution, it's semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) that's truly become the face of the movement.\n\nDespite the early success of the AI revolution, Nvidia may be in a giant bubble\n\nThe way I regularly describe Nvidia's role is as the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are used by businesses in high-compute data centers. Nvidia's GPUs are the foundation that allows for the split-second decision-making required of AI software and systems. The analysts at Citigroup have suggested that Nvidia could account for a 90% share of GPU's deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nWhat's been particularly beneficial for Nvidia is that demand for its high-powered AI chips has overwhelmed supply. It's enjoyed exceptional pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs, which is largely responsible for its skyrocketing data center sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, there are also reasons to believe Nvidia -- and potentially even the AI movement as a whole -- is in a sizable bubble. For instance, every next-big-thing trend over the past three decades has endured an early stage bubble. Investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nMore specific to Nvidia, it's set to face a monumental increase in external and internal competition. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have AI-focused GPUs they're rolling out this year to directly compete with Nvidia in high-compute data centers. Additionally, some of Nvidia's largest customers are developing AI chips of their own, which could lessen their future reliance on the current king of AI.\n\nNvidia also anticipates production for its A100 and H100 chips will increase, which would be expected to lessen AI-GPU scarcity. Since scarcity has been the company's core catalyst on the pricing front, it's quite possible Nvidia will cannibalize its own margins as its data center segment scales.\n\nInstead of putting your money to work in an AI stock that may very well be in a bubble at a multiple of 34 times last year's sales, consider investing in the following two AI stocks that aren't at risk of a collapse if history rhymes, once more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first AI stock that offers a considerably better value proposition than Nvidia and isn't at risk of a collapse if the AI bubble bursts is social media titan Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nMeta is using Ai in a variety of ways. It's monitoring comments on its various social sites for noncompliance, and giving businesses access to generative AI solutions that can help tailor their messages to individual users to (ideally) improve sales.\n\nWhile Meta's stock has undeniably enjoyed a hearty boost because of the AI revolution, many of the company's investments are geared at moving the needle years from now. It's why CEO Mark Zuckerburg has been perfectly content with Reality Labs losing more than $10 billion annually to further Meta's virtual/augmented reality and metaverse ambitions.\n\nWhat would ultimately protect Meta from an AI collapse is the company's top-notch social media real estate, which includes the most-popular social media platform on the planet, Facebook, along with Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. Collectively, Meta's family of apps attracted almost 4 billion monthly active users to its sites during the December-ended quarter. Businesses realize that Meta's social sites reach the broadest audience, which is what typically affords the company exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nAnother reason investors don't have to worry about Meta being in a bubble is the company's cash flow and balance sheet. It closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and ultimately generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities for the year. Meta has the luxury of taking chances since its foundational business is a cash-printing machine.\n\nDespite crossing above the $500-per-share mark to end last week, Meta stock remains considerably cheaper than Nvidia. Shares can be picked up right now for 22 times forward-year earnings and roughly 13 times forecast cash flow in 2025. By comparison, Nvidia trades at nearly 28 times Wall Street's consensus cash flow for the following year.\n\nBaidu\n\nA second AI stock that's demonstrably cheaper than Nvidia and not at risk of collapse if the AI bubble were to burst is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\n\nSimilar to Meta, Baidu has quite a few applications for artificial intelligence. The company's AI Cloud held the fourth-highest share of cloud infrastructure service spending in China, as of March 2023, based on estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. Meanwhile, Apollo Go is the most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service in the world, with more than 5 million accumulated rides since inception.\n\nDespite making aggressive investments in AI, Baidu's bread-and-butter operating segment continues to be its internet search engine. In January, Baidu accounted for approximately 60% of internet search within China, which was 44 percentage points higher than its next-closest competitor. With few exceptions, Baidu's search engine has sustained a 60% to 85% share of internet search for the world's No. 2 economy dating back nine years. This makes Baidu the logical go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s).\n\nBaidu should also benefit from the reopening of the Chinese economy following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three years of stringent and unpredictable lockdowns that attempted to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have led to sizable supply chain kinks in China's economy. These are steadily being worked out, which is good news for Baidu's revenue and profit trajectory.\n\nThe company also has a veritable treasure chest of cash to cushion any potential bubble-popping event in AI. Baidu closed out 2023 with more than $28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, which is more than enough capital to fuel innovation in all facets of its operations.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Baidu is historically cheap. Shares closed out the previous week at just 8 times forward-year consensus earnings and a little north of 7 times estimated cash flow in 2025. It makes for a smarter buy than Nvidia considering the history of bubbles associated with next-big-thing investment trends.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Dell Just Gave Nvidia and AMD Investors Something to Cheer -- and Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Investors Something to Perhaps Fear",
        "content": "You don't have to read tea leaves to try to learn about companies' prospects. However, it's not a bad idea to read the transcripts from other companies that operate in the same industry. Sometimes, executives from a competitor, customer, or vendor share things in quarterly updates that provide insight you can't get anywhere else.\n\nDell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) just might have done just that last week. On Feb. 29, the technology company held its quarterly conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter results. During that call, Dell gave Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Computers(NASDAQ: AMD) investors something to cheer. And it perhaps gave Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors something to fear.\n\nSomething to cheer\n\nLike many companies, Dell is enjoying strong tailwinds from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). COO Jeff Clark said in the Q4 conference call that his company saw robust demand for its AI-optimized servers. Clark added that Dell's flagship PowerEdge XE9680 is \"the fastest-ramping solution in company history.\" Overall, orders in Q4 for the company's AI-optimized servers soared by nearly 40% from the previous quarter.\n\nWhy is this something for Nvidia and AMD investors to cheer? Dell's AI-optimized servers use graphics processing units (GPUs) from both Nvidia and AMD. Clark said that the high demand \"was spread across the H100, H800, the H200, and the MI300X.\" The first three of those GPUs are made by Nvidia, while the last one is made by AMD.\n\nClark noted that \"demand continues to outpace GPU supply.\" He stated that there's \"strong interest\" from customers in servers with next-generation AI GPUs such as Nvidia's H200 and AMD's MI300X. Importantly, Clark observed that \"most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of the comments from Dell's COO should bring smiles to Nvidia and AMD investors. The picture painted by Clark is one of tremendous current demand for the two chipmaker's GPUs that doesn't appear to be waning.\n\nFew will find any of what Clark said surprising, of course. However, it's good to hear confirmation from an industry leader who isn't associated with Nvidia or AMD. And his comments seem to help justify the massive gains both stocks have delivered so far this year.\n\nSomething to fear?\n\nBut Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet investors might not like some of Clark's other statements. He seemed to take a deliberate dig at predictions that the cloud is where the future of AI lies.\n\nClark said, \"We believe the long-term AI action is on-prem [on-premises], where customers can keep their data and intellectual property safe and secure.\" He pointed out that around 83% of all data is currently stored on-premises.\n\nAccording to Clark's view, more data will be generated at the edge of networks outside of data centers going forward than inside data centers. Because of this, he argued that \"AI will ultimately get deployed next to where the data is created, driven by latency.\"\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his company's Q3 call in October 2023: \"[C]ustomers want to bring the [AI] models to their data, not the other way around.\" That might sound as if he and Clark are on the same page. However, Jassy also stated in Amazon's 2023 Q1 call that he believes that the heavy concentration of IT spending that's currently on-premises will move to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) benefiting from this transition.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella proclaimed in January 2023, \"The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it.\" He made this statement in the context of discussing Microsoft's cloud platform, boasting that his company had \"the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud.\"\n\nWhat does Alphabet think? CEO Sundar Pichai said in his company's latest quarterly update that AI is \"driving interest and early adoption\" of Google Cloud. This AI boom has been the primary tailwind driving Alphabet stock higher over the last 12 months.\n\nBut if Clark is right that the future of AI is on-premises and not in the cloud, the growth prospects for Amazon, Microsoft, and Google perhaps won't be as strong as their CEOs and investors anticipate. In Dell's vision of what's on the way, local devices could be more important than cloud platforms.\n\nCheers all around\n\nShould Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet investors be worried? I don't think so. The underlying reasons why organizations continue to move their apps and data to the cloud won't go away. Cloud platforms help lower total costs and provide more flexibility and scalability than on-premises data centers.\n\nThat said, I do think that Clark is probably right that the use of AI on local devices will increase. He's also absolutely correct that customers are only in the early innings of AI deployment.\n\nThere's good news for all of these companies, in my view. Nvidia and AMD should win as the demand for GPUs soars. Dell should win as the demand for AI-optimized servers grows. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet should win as more customers build AI apps on the cloud. Everyone has something to cheer about.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "AMD Hits US Roadblock in Selling AI Chip Tailored for China",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. hit a US government roadblock in attempting to sell an artificial intelligence chip tailored for the Chinese market, according to people familiar with the matter, part of Washington’s crackdown on the export of advanced technologies to the country.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Rules Trump Can Appear on Presidential Ballots America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop. Wall Street’s DEI Retreat Has Officially Begun China Scraps Premier Li's Briefing, Breaking Years of Convention Wall Street Holds Back on Big Bets Before Key Data: Markets Wrap\n\nAMD had hoped to gain a green light from the Commerce Department to sell the AI processor to Chinese customers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The chip has lower performance than what AMD sells outside of China and was designed to meet US export restrictions, they said.\n\nBut US officials told AMD that the chip was still too powerful and that the company must obtain a license from Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security in order to sell it, the people said. AMD didn’t have an immediate comment, while the Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. It’s not yet clear whether AMD is applying for a license.\n\nThe US has been working to limit Chinese access to cutting-edge semiconductors that can develop AI models — and the tools used to manufacture those chips — out of fear that Beijing will gain a military edge. President Joe Biden’s administration unveiled an initial set of export controls in 2022 and strengthened them last October to include more technology and curb sales to intermediary nations that might undermine the ban.\n\nRead More: Nvidia Warns of Product Snags From Tightening US Chip Rules\n\nThe tighter controls restricted the sale of a processor that leading AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. had designed specifically for China — in compliance with the initial 2022 version of the export rules. The company has since developed new customized, less-powerful products for the Chinese market to align with the 2023 restrictions, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said that she is looking into the specifics of those components.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 2022 US ban prevented both Nvidia and AMD from selling their most powerful AI chips to China, forcing them to find workarounds. Nvidia immediately responded with a reduced-performance modified model, whereas AMD hasn’t publicly discussed its efforts to develop a new AI processor for the country.\n\nAMD had less of a foothold in the Chinese AI chip industry than Nvidia, which had a large share of that market prior to the ban. When the restrictions took effect in 2022, AMD said it didn’t expect to be materially affected by the rules.\n\nBut AMD is now going after the AI chip market more aggressively. In December, it launched a new MI300 lineup that will challenge processors from Nvidia. The China-tailored product has been referred to as MI309, according to the people. It’s not clear which Chinese customer was trying to buy the AMD AI chips. That factor could influence whether the company is able to secure a license, should the chipmaker choose to move forward.\n\nLeading Chinese tech firms, including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc., have said they have stockpiled enough powerful chips from Nvidia — the types that are now subject to US controls — to advance their chatbots’ capabilities for another year or two.\n\nMeanwhile, Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co. is developing its own AI semiconductors and chipmaking capability that could eventually help Chinese companies fill the gap created by the US ban.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Could Trigger a Natural Gas Boom in Europe",
        "content": "When the use of seismic surveys became common place, Oil and gas drillers used to drill only in spots the human eye could detect from seismic and other data, but that’s all changing now. The next round of onshore discoveries is being aided by new Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning software that sees what we can’t, forever disrupting the exploration game.\n\nNowhere is this more urgent than in Europe—a continent starved for domestic resources since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the weaponization of Russian natural gas.\n\nMachine Learning software capable of sampling large volumes of 3D seismic, breaking down wave forms to identify unique patterns, and revealing new targets for the drill bit that the human eye has never seen …\n\nThat completely changes exploration.\n\nIt’s been used around the world, and now, it’s being deployed in Austria and Germany by junior explorer MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), the North American company that is the first to offer investors exposure to European natural gas since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nMCF saw the value of this technology early on and has used it extensively wherever possible in their search for gas in Europe, according to its CEO, James Hill.\n\nAnd for Germany, in particular, the timing is critical. Critical enough, in fact, that the EU has reclassified natural gas as “Green” and sustainable.\n\nIf Germany fails to sustainably make up for its winding down of Russian natural gas domestically, high-priced LNG imports, delayed nuclear power phaseout and even restarting of dormant coal plants will be the outcome. Renewables cannot yet bridge the gap in the energy transition, and resorting to coal would set things back drastically for the climate.\n\nNatural Gas Paradise Beyond the Human Eye\n\nIn the past, humans only picked prospects to drill visually from the 3D seismic aided by visual hydrocarbon indicators in the data. Now, thanks to new software, they can drill in places they never would have before. AI and Machine Learning sees what we can’t.\n\nStory continues\n\nMCF Energy has both—the power of AI to see beyond the human eye, and prospects with a previously drilled  well that produced gas in Austria, along with two previous discoveries in Germany. MCF has just started drilling at its Welchau prospect in Austria. Welchau is a geologic structure you can see from space and covers about 100 sq km.  An independent evaluation estimated potentially recoverable resources of some 100 million barrels of oil equivalent in an evaluation last year.  A well drilled in the 80’s found producible gas and condensate just south of the location being drilled, confirming the presence of gas in the area.\n\nWhen this 40-day drill is complete, MCF is planning to move the drill rig to Germany, where it will re-open an oil and gas play of over 110 square kilometers in the Lech and East Lech concessions, which have already seen two historical discoveries and three previously drilled wells at Lech.\n\nThey’re not drilling blind, or with limitations of the human eye.\n\n\"The Machine Learning technology that MCF Energy is using allows for the computer to ‘see’ information within seismic data which the human eye cannot. This technology is a game changer and is only now being discovered by other operators,” MCF Energy’s Hill told Oilprice.com recently. Using Paradise software, MCF Energy’s key AI analyst, advisor Deborah Sacrey, has a prediction success rate of over 80% for drilling in areas that are not visual to humans on the data. She has 9 discoveries of this nature to her name, according to the company.\n\nSacrey, a geologist and geophysicist with 45 years of oil and gas exploration experience in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of the U.S., specializes in 2D and 3D seismic interpretation. She’s the only one using Paradise for her clientele, and that’s because she was one of its developers.\n\nParadise software isn’t proprietary, but only a small field of experts have the ability to effectively use it, and MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF) has the advantage of having one of its developers on its advisory board.\n\nThe power of supercomputing has now reached the point of being able to sample data within a 3D seismic volume and break down the wave forms into over 50 “neurons” that each have different attributes of waves. Those “neurons” are then matched up to well information in both dry and producing wells. And comparing this treasure trove of data then yields a unique set of “neurons” that identify gas, oil, porosity and many other factors that control production.\n\nSource: Geoinsights.com\n\nAI scans the entire data set for those unique sets of “neurons” and identifies them on the map.\n\nParadise software, according to Sacrey, analyzes seismic data 15 times more densely than other existing software, and that allows it to distinguish very thin beds of deposition in the subsurface and see thin streaks of porosity that the human eye cannot.\n\nParadise’s Fault Detection uses deep learning and machine learning to automatically detect faults, and generates attributes to extract meaningful geological information.\n\nState-of-the-art color-blending highlights geologic features, such as faults or stratigraphic features, in 3D.\n\nParadise software applies Self-Organizing Map (SOM) unsupervised machine learning to reveal stratigraphic facies and their distributions, and captures facies based on distinctive seismic patterns using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning technology.\n\nEstimating volumes of reserves, resources and geologic features, and comparing machine learning classification results and other seismic attributes to traditional well logs should help explorers like MCF get the drill bit in the right place faster, cheaper and much more efficiently.\n\nThis potentially gives MCF Energy a “leg up” when it comes to analyzing the areas to drill and helps to reduce risk in understanding the subsurface.\n\nHow AI Is Changing Exploration & Discovery\n\nThe oil and gas industry is AI’s and Machine Learning’s biggest cheerleader.\n\nThat’s because the disruption these technologies creates and opens opportunities, which could turn into major upside. Forbes calls the changes “profound”, noting that the world’s top 20 oil and gas producers all have major AI strategies for every point along the chain.\n\nMordor Intelligence projected oil and gas spending on AI to close out 2023 at $2.38 billion, and to reach $4.21 billion by the end of 2028.\n\nNew AI announcements come on a near-daily basis.\n\nShell—the biggest producer in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico--will use AI-based technology from big-data analytics company SparkCognition for deep sea exploration and production—both to pinpoint where to drill and boost offshore production.\n\nAI could shorten exploration to less than nine days from nine months, the two companies said in a statement, with SparkCognition’s Bruce Porter noting that “generative AI for seismic imaging can positively disrupt the exploration process and has broad and far-reaching implications\".\n\nBack in Europe, MCF is doing the same—onshore, and on a continent that desperately needs to secure energy independence from Russia, without creating a secondary dependence on expensive American LNG.\n\nNow, as MCF Energy (TSXV:MCF; OTC:MCFNF), prepares for its first drill in Germany, it’s armed with a significant AI and Machine Learning advantage for targeting drills in plays abandoned by supermajors decades ago, before Europe realized it couldn’t survive on cheap Russian gas anymore.\n\nMCF’s Lech prospect in Germany came with a modern 3D seismic survey of over 160 square kilometers of 3D seismic data to apply new Paradise Machine Learning technology to. “Using this,” said Hill, “we were able to identify the gas-bearing zones precisely and compare them to the rest of the area. We compared the known gas-bearing area in Lech with the rest of the survey covering Lech East and identified multiple prospects with great potential.”\n\nParadise’s AI – Machine Learning Workbench distinguishes thin beds and Direct Hydrocarbon indicators while identifying and calibrating detailed stratigraphy and automatically detecting faults and revealing fracture trends. It also classifies seismic facies, isolates geobodies and calculates potential oil and gas volumes .\n\nMachine learning allows for the concise ability to reveal the natural gas targets and handle well placement to key zones with porosity and hydrocarbon potential identical to the proven areas, and MCF was one of the first companies to apply it to the entire exploration and development program, according to Hill.\n\n“This proven technique greatly reduces the risk in drilling and helps target the best possible places and depths to drill these wells,” Hill said, adding that it has had a prediction success rate of over 80% when it comes to predicting the geology to identify previously unseen discoveries.\n\nBig Tech is Turning the Oil and Gas Sector on Its Head\n\nGoogle Cloud, a product of Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Was Popping Again Today",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were climbing again today even though there was no company-specific news on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock juggernaut. However, AI stocks have a tendency to move in unison, and good news from fellow traveler Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) seemed to lift Nvidia stock as well.\n\nSuper Micro shares jumped after the S&P Global said that the maker of servers and storage equipment that are especially valued for AI applications would join the S&P 500 on March 18. The news acts as a broader stamp of approval for Super Micro and the rest of the AI sector and seemed to spark a new round of euphoria as investors piled into these stocks again.\n\nNvidia closed at 3.6% after trading up as high as 6.6% earlier in the session, while Super Micro Computer had gained 25.3%. Among the other winners in the AI space were Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which both finished up more than 3%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA rising AI tide lifts all boats\n\nAfter having a banner year in 2023, Nvidia has gotten out to a breakneck start in 2024 as the stock is now up roughly 75% year to date.\n\nNvidia's own strong fourth-quarter results have helped drive those gains, but it's also surged nearly every time there's been good news out on a peer. For example, last Friday the stock gained when Dell Technologies said it was seeing surging demand for AI servers, and earlier in February, it rose on strong quarterly results from Arm Holdings, a close partner in chip design.\n\nBoth Super Micro and Nvidia are experiencing massive revenue growth from AI-related demand, and they have been two of the biggest winners from the AI boom. Therefore, it's not surprising to see Nvidia responding to good news for Super Micro.\n\nWhat's next for Nvidia\n\nUpdates from companies in recent weeks have shown that the AI boom is only picking up steam as cloud-computing companies and others build out their AI infrastructure and products like Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) remain in high demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nLater this week, we'll get an update from Broadcom, known for its strength in networking chips which are expected to play a role in AI, and next week Arm Holdings' initial public offering (IPO) lock-up period will expire, which could lead to volatility in that stock.\n\nEither of those events could move Nvidia stock as well. Expect Nvidia to continue to be volatile on broader AI news, though the surge in demand for AI products makes the stock more likely to go up than down.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Over the past decade, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE:ANF) has undergone a significant transformation, bouncing back from its lowest point to reestablishing itself as a dominant player in the retail landscape.\n\nIn 2023, Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a 285% increase in its stock price, followed by more than 50% uptick so far in 2024. While other fashion retailers like American Eagle Outfitters Inc., Levi Strauss & Co. and Macy’s have also seen growth in their stock prices in 2024, none have matched the rise of Abercrombie & Fitch.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nFortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series. This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch even outpaced artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia Corp. in 2023, a feat that caught many by surprise given Nvidia’s formidable reputation in the technology sector. Nvidia saw a 238% stock price growth in 2023.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch is seeing constantly growing sales. Revenue was up 20% compared with the previous year, according to its third-quarter report.\n\nA key factor in Abercrombie & Fitch's success has been its strategic use of platforms like TikTok to engage with customers and build a stronger, more relevant brand in today’s fashion landscape. By listening to customer feedback and leveraging the authenticity of TikTok’s community, Abercrombie & Fitch has humanized its brand and better connected with its target audience.\n\n\"Over the past few years, we've been laser-focused on listening to our customers and TikTok has been the perfect platform for fostering that communication,\" Abercrombie Brands’ Senior Vice President and Head of Marketing Carey Collins Krug told Teen Vogue. \"We watch the reviews and hauls of our products. We take notes of how people describe the quality and fit. There's an authenticity innate to TikTok and its entire community that has allowed us to humanize Abercrombie.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This startup coined “eBay for gamers” with a breaktaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\n\nAdditionally, Abercrombie & Fitch has integrated AI technology into its product design process, allowing it to quickly iterate and refine its offerings based on historical data and customer preferences. This strategic integration of technology has enabled Abercrombie & Fitch to stay ahead of the curve and continuously innovate in a rapidly evolving retail environment.\n\nSamir Desai, the company's executive vice president and chief digital and technology officer, elaborated on this approach, stating, “We feed [the tech] historical images of products that have sold really well and use prompts to iterate and refine and base a new line off of that. It's driving inspiration, it's driving velocity and how quickly [the team] can produce product images.”\n\nIt’s important to acknowledge Abercrombie & Fitch's past challenges, including controversies surrounding its lack of plus-size options in 2013, which led to a boycott and accusations of discrimination. The company has since taken steps to address these issues and broaden its inclusivity, reflecting a commitment to adaptability and growth.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch’s resurgence serves as a testament to the enduring power of strategic vision, adaptability and innovation in the face of change. As the company continues to evolve and innovate, its trajectory highlights the importance of staying agile and responsive to shifting consumer preferences and technological advancements in the retail industry.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. could soon be dethroned as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 by another artificial intelligence-linked firm with staggering returns in the past year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSupreme Court Rules Trump Can Appear on Presidential Ballots Wall Street’s DEI Retreat Has Officially Begun China Scraps Premier Li's Briefing, Breaking Years of Convention America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop. What to Remember If the Stock Market Takes a Dive\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer Inc. are up as much as 28% in intraday trading Monday and on track to close at an all-time high following news that the company is set to be added to the S&P 500 Index later this month. The move extended gains for the server and software provider to more than 1,000% in the past twelve months, dwarfing Nvidia’s nearly 260% rally during the same period.\n\nThe gain this year alone has added about $48 billion to Super Micro’s market capitalization, pushing its total value to nearly $64 billion.\n\n“It makes sense for it to be included in the S&P,” said Shana Sissel, CEO at Banrion Capital Management LLC. “It could actually drive the S&P higher, because now you have a name other than Nvidia that will be driving returns.”\n\nSuper Micro’s addition to the S&P 500 Index means that the benchmark will have even more AI representation outside of the top technology companies that have lead the broader market higher this year. Deckers Outdoor Corp. will also be added to the index, replacing Whirlpool Corp. and Zions Bancorp.\n\nThe San Jose, California-based company’s surge received an additional boost in January when it reported preliminary results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and signaled strong demand for AI.\n\n“In just over a year, its stock price soared from around $102 to over $1,000, attributed to increased demand for AI—related products and positive growth forecasts,” Rosenblatt Securities Inc. analyst Hans Mosesmann wrote in a note dated March 4. Mosesmann has a buy rating and the Street-high price target of $1,300 for shares of Super Micro.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be sure, the stock has experienced some volatility in recent weeks. At the end of February, short sellers betting on declines in the stock notched paper gains of $1.2 billion when shares tumbled 20% in one day. Since then, the shares have traded even higher, putting year-to-date paper losses for the group at more than $3.2 billion, according to data from S3 Partners LLC.\n\nRead more: Super Micro Short Sellers Notch $1.2 Billion as Shares Fall (1)\n\nAnd, while stocks generally leap on the news that they’ll be joining the S&P 500 Index, gains are usually muted once they’re added, Sissel said.\n\n“For people who think this means that all of a sudden this pushes Super Micro Computer up even more, I’d temper that,” she said. “Following the completion of the inclusion, you usually see the stock sell off a little bit.”\n\nStill, Wall Street is overall bullish on the company. Super Micro has 11 buy ratings, four holds and only one sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The current average price target of $819 implies a roughly 28% downside for shares, but analyst targets often lag rallies like the one that Super Micro has seen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace Private Equity’s Green Star Started It All With a Database The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "The Art of Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Taxes in a World of AI",
        "content": "The AI Wave\n\nThe weather may be cold during winter, but stocks were scorching hot last month, fueled in part by the surge in performance from AI (Artificial Intelligence) stocks. More specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up +2.2% to 38,996. The S&P 500 surged +5.2% to 5,096. And the AI-heavy Nasdaq index climbed the most by +6.1% to 16,092.\n\nLeading the bull market brigade higher was NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which saw its stock launch higher by +29% for the month after reporting eye-popping quarterly revenues of $22 billion, more than tripling versus last year's comparable quarter. Customers of NVIDIA, like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are also benefiting from the rising tide of investor sentiment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nTo put this AI wave into perspective, you need look no further than to the comments made by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who stated by the end of 2024, the company should have 350,000 of NVIDIA's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) as part of the company's AI infrastructure. At roughly $25,000 to $30,000 per GPU, the total cost is likely approaching $10 billion for just this one NVIDIA customer. Also, Dell Technologies' (NYSE:DELL) stock price opened more than +30% higher today after reporting quarterly financial results that exceeded forecasts due to robust demand for AI servers, which led to their backlog almost doubling in three months to $2.9 billion.\n\nWhen you have corporate America in addition to the large cloud data center providers (think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud) all battling to secure NVIDIA chips for their generative AI, machine learning initiatives, you can understand why NVIDIA's stock is up +250% in one year to a company value of $2 trillion. The Art of Maximizing Gains and Minimizing Taxes in a World of AI\n\nJapan's Nikkei & Dow Both Break 39,000 Record Concurrently\n\nNot only did the Dow hit an all-time record high of 39,000 last month, but a stunning coincidence also occurred in Japan. The Nikkei 225, which is like the Japanese equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also hit a record high of 39,000 last month. What's the big difference between these two indexes simultaneously surpassing a record 39,000 in the same month?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt took the Nikkei over 34 years to surpass its previous record peak, which was last achieved in 1989 when Japan experienced a massive bursting of an asset bubble. On the other hand, it merely took the Dow just one month to break its previous recordnot four decades. Worth noting, so far in 2024, the Nikkei has been the world's best-performing major index surging 19%, almost triple the gain of the S&P 500 index.\n\nTax Time\n\nApril is fast approaching, which means it's that time of the year when Uncle Sam will come knocking on your door with your tax bill. Perhaps your taxes have already been prepaid and a refund is coming your way. Regardless, the goal of long-term investing is to master the art of maximizing returns and limiting taxes subject to your risk tolerance.\n\nHow does one create an investment masterpiece? One way to maximize return is to lower costs, including lower management fees, fund fees, and transaction costs. You can think of these investment costs as a leaky faucet. In the short-run, most people do not care about or are unaware of a leak.\n\nThe same principle applies to investment fees/costs. Investors can ignore these fees in the short-term, but over months or years, these costs can become enormous and destructive. I experienced this firsthand. Recently, normal monthly water bill was $40, but one leaky toilet resulted in an $800 monthly billouch! Just imagine what unknown leaky costs on your investments could mean for your retirement. Do you want high or unknown investment fees to delay your retirement by years? I think not. Focus on lower costs because quite simply, the less you pay, the more you keep, and the earlier you can retire.\n\nAnother way to maximize your investment performance is to benefit from the power of compounding. This phenomenon can only be achieved via the snowball-effect of long-term investing. This is why Albert Einstein called compounding the 8th Wonder of the World. At Sidoxia Capital Management, we have experienced this marvel on many of our investments, including our exponential gains in Amazon.com, which we first purchased in 2008 at s split-adjusted price of about $2.95 per share. The stock price recently closed at $177, a 60-fold increase from our initial purchase.\n\nThe risk-adjusted aspect of your nest-egg is also important because most people should consider decreasing risk as you more closely approach retirement age, especially if you are planning to tap your investments for liquidity. If risk wasn't a consideration, going to the Las Vegas roulette table and betting your life savings on black might be a good idea. Sure, you might have a chance of doubling your money instantly, but you could also lose it all in a blink of an eye.\n\nAnother way of thinking about risk, since we are in the heart of ski season, is to contemplate a ski instructor's advice for an 80-year-old beginner vs. an experienced Olympic downhill gold medalist. It wouldn't make sense for the 80-year-old beginner to train on the steep, advanced black diamond runs. Similarly, it wouldn't make sense for the gold-medalist Olympian to train on the flat beginner runs. The same concept holds true for investing. Young investors generally can take on more risk, while retirees often should be more conservative in their asset allocation, especially if they need liquidity from their investments to fund their living expenses and lifestyle.\n\nAlthough it would be nice to have ChatGPT create a luxurious retirement for you with a click of a button, unfortunately life is not that simple. You certainly can, and should, take advantage of the AI revolution in your investment portfolio to support your retirement goals, but successful investing requires more than that. With over 30 years of investment experience under my belt, at Sidoxia, we understand there are multiple facets to successful investing. In a diversified portfolio that that takes account of your risk tolerance, we strongly believe low-cost, tax-efficient, long-term investing is the best way to create your retirement masterpiece.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks, including NVDA, META, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, and certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), but at the time of publishing had no direct position in DELL or any other security referenced in this article.

        "content": "On Thursday, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL) surpassed both top and bottom-line analyst expectations with fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results. Upon results, Dell shares popped almost 20% as through its ongoing partnerships with AI leaders including Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), AI tech advances enabled Dell to report significant gains.\n\nFourth fiscal quarter highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on February 2nd, Dell reported revenue dropped 11% YoY to $25.04 billion. But net income increased 89% YoY to $1.16 billion.\n\nRevenue segmentation\n\nInfrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) brought in 9.3 billion to the revenue table and although it was a 6% YoY drop, the figure is a 10% increase from the previous, third, quarter. Servers and networking were the main revenue fuels with $4.9 billion of revenue being driven by AI-optimized servers.\n\nStorage revenue observed a 16% sequential increase as it brought in $4.5 billion.\n\nClient Solutions Group (CSG) observed a 12% YoY drop to $11.7 billion, including $9.6 billion in commercial client revenue that reported a 11% YoY rise and $2.2 billion in consumer revenue that tanked 19% YoY.\n\nFiscal year highlights\n\nFiscal year revenue dropped 14% YoY to $88.4 billion, but still topped estimates. Dell made a net income of $7.7 billion, smashing the consensus estimate of $4.9 billion.\n\nFull-year ISG revenue tanked contracted 12% YoY to $33.9 billion. Full-year CSG revenue also contracted 16% YoY to $48.9 billion.\n\nChief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke spoke of the company’s strong AI-optimized server momentum with orders expanding nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, ending the fiscal year with $2.9 billion.\n\nOutlook built on AI potential and the power of joined forces\n\nFor its first quarter, Dell guided for revenue between $21 billion and $22 billion. Encouraged by AI momentum around AI, Dell expects to return to growth during fiscal 2025. However, Dell acknowledged the pressure of the macroeconomic environment due to which some customers are approaching infrastructure investments cautiously.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite macroeconomic pressures, Dell is hoping for a brigther future built on AI  strategic investments. Last year, Dell announced a joint initative with Nvidia. Through project Helix, Dell and Nvidia embarked on a journey to make it easier for businesses to quickly develop and use generative AI models to securely deliver quality customer service, along with a range of capabilities. With this project, Dell and Nvidia will support the complete lifecycle of generative AI.\n\nDell also ended 2023 by expanding its partnership with AMD. Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 server will support the AMD Instinct™ MI300X accelertor, a CPU-GPU design for AI workloads. With its latest chip, AMD is promising to challenge the AI chip dominance that Nvidia enjoyed. AMD claims that the MI300X chip offers superior memory capacity and bandwith compared to Nvidia-made chips. Undoubtedly, AMD’s Instinct MI300 series marked a pivotal moment, bringing a promise of a potential power shift in the AI chip landscape.\n\nDell is betting its recovery on strategtic AI investments. As a testament to its business self-confidence, it announced it will increasing its annual dividend by 20% to $1.78 per share.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "This Billionaire Investor Has 21% of His Portfolio Invested in These 2 Artificial Intelligence Growth Stocks",
        "content": "After decades of success, legendary money manager Stanley Druckenmiller \"retired\" to manage the Duquesne Family Office. The firm's portfolio currently has approximately $3.3 billion in assets under management.\n\nOf that total, a whopping 21% is in two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). These two AI stalwarts have clobbered the broader stock market over the years.\n\nBut does that make them suitable for your portfolio today? Here is what you need to know.\n\n1. OpenAI is a long-term boost for Microsoft's cloud business\n\nTech giant Microsoft has been part of the Duquesne Family portfolio for a decade. Druckenmiller bought his first shares back in 2014. The company had already been a multi-decade winner, and the rise of AI has only added more juice to Microsoft's growth, catapulting the company to an eye-popping $3 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft built an empire on personal computer software but has expanded to enterprise software, gaming, and cloud computing.\n\nMicrosoft's genius move was to see the beginning of AI begin to take shape and partnering with software developer OpenAI back in 2016. The company furthered that partnership in 2019 and again in early 2023, as OpenAI's generative AI model ChatGPT launched and changed the entire technology industry.\n\nToday, Microsoft and OpenAI are deeply intertwined, including cloud exclusivity for Azure on all OpenAI compute workloads. That exposure is helping grow Azure as it works to close the market share gap with the current leading platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Recent data suggests Azure has an estimated 24% of global cloud business as of the fourth quarter of 2023, an all-time high for the company.\n\nThese developing trends, along with Microsoft's position as an all-around tech juggernaut, make the stock an easy buy-and-hold for any investor.\n\n2. Nvidia's head start in AI chips is a potential moat\n\nDruckenmiller had dabbled in Nvidia a couple of times but leaned into the company in late 2022, just as the first ripples of AI were beginning. The Duquesne Family fund bought 583,000 shares in late 2022 and added along the way in what has been a home run. The stock has appreciated over 400% since the start of 2023. In recent quarters, Druckenmiller has taken some profits, but Nvidia remains the fund's third-largest holding.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has become the runaway leader in AI chips. How? Nvidia realized that AI computing would potentially work better on GPU chips, like what it specializes in, versus traditional processor chips. Nvidia began focusing on data centers in the late 2010s, and the explosion of AI has launched Nvidia into a leadership position rather quickly. Analysts estimate that as much as 90% of the AI chip market belongs to Nvidia, and that market could grow to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next several years.\n\nThanks to AI, the data center business has become the majority of revenue for a company that was once known for gaming chips. It's a monumental shift that has lucratively rewarded shareholders. Competition will push back on Nvidia's dominance, including some big customers working to build alternatives. Nonetheless, Nvidia plays a massive role in creating the computing foundation needed to utilize AI throughout the modern economy. It's hard to see that dramatically changing.\n\nHow investors should approach each stock\n\nIt's hard to call stocks cheap when they've appreciated as much as Microsoft and Nvidia have, but these stocks aren't as eye-poppingly expensive as you would think. If you look at each stock's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio to compare their earnings multiple to their expected growth rate, Microsoft is a little steep at a PEG ratio of 2, but there are far worse deals on Wall Street. At a PEG of 1, Nvidia is arguably a bargain if it can meet the long-term expectations analysts have set forth. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nInvestors should remember that Druckenmiller is already sitting on massive gains, so it's not necessarily suitable to run out and buy these companies because some billionaire owns them. But if you believe that Microsoft or Nvidia can continue delivering over the coming years, buying a little at a time to build an investment slowly would be an excellent way to add these stocks to your portfolio.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 tech stocks to sell according to Cathie Wood. If you want to skip our discussion on Cathie Wood’s latest investment plays, head over to 5 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood.\n\nARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is adapting her investment strategy to navigate an anticipated deflationary period in 2024, focusing on innovation and technological advancements. She discussed this approach on CNBC's \"The Exchange\", emphasizing its relevance in the 2024 market landscape. Wood anticipates an aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, creating an economic environment where companies adept at deflation and dedicated to innovation can experience significant expansion. Wood's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF, witnessed a noteworthy 70% year-to-date increase in 2023. As the market stabilizes, ARK is diversifying its portfolio, considering the potential reopening of the IPO market and reintroducing previously sold names with improving outlooks.\n\nWood's strategy shift includes an increased focus on companies leading in AI and technology, exemplified by her renewed interest in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). She highlighted Meta's alignment with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's use of open-source AI. Wood also emphasized the transformative potential of gene editing technologies, particularly mentioning CRISPR Therapeutics, following the FDA approval of the first gene therapy using CRISPR CAS 9 for sickle cell disease. Despite early-stage pricing inefficiencies and cash-burn issues, Wood sees the gene editing sector as an attractive investment opportunity. In another noteworthy development, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) surpassed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and became ARK's top holding in Q4 2023.\n\nAccording to Cathie Wood, the hype around electric vehicles is just beginning. In the firm's recent \"Big Ideas\" report, Wood predicts that sales of new battery-powered cars could increase by a third each year, reaching 74 million in 2030, with autonomous driving capabilities. Despite approximately 10 million EVs delivered in 2023, the forecast suggests substantial growth. At an average selling price of $20,000 per EV, this could result in over $1.4 trillion in annual revenue potential for EV manufacturers. Wood believes these companies may capture a tenth of that as profit before interest and tax. The downside is a potential decline in demand for internal combustion engine cars, as global new vehicle sales are projected to be around 100 million in 2030. This shift may lead to a \"death spiral for incumbent auto manufacturers,\" warned ARK Invest. Wood gained prominence for her successful bets on Tesla, forecasting a target share price of $2,000 in 2027, primarily driven by Elon Musk solving autonomous driving challenges. Looking ahead to 2040, ARK Invest envisions a \"Cambrian explosion\" in battery technology applications, leading to the transformation of urban landscapes with the advent of flying taxis.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in January 2024, Cathie Wood raised her bullish estimate for Bitcoin's price to $1,500,000 by 2030, a 50% increase from her previous prediction of $1 million. Wood attributed the increased likelihood of this optimistic scenario to the recent SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. According to her, this approval serves as a green light for the cryptocurrency. In a bear case, Wood anticipates a price of $258,500, while the base case is set at $682,800. ARK Invest supported its projections by pointing to factors such as a higher hashrate, long-term holder supply, and addresses with a non-zero balance.\n\nWhile Cathie Wood is bullish on innovation and disruptive technologies, some of the stocks to sell according to the ARK CEO include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Cathie Wood’s ARK portfolio for Q4 2023 and selected the technology stocks where she discarded her stake by at least 20% or more in the last quarter of 2023. We have arranged the list in the ascending order of the percentage of stake discarded. We have also assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). 12 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Investment Management\n\nTech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood\n\n12.

We expect the firm to consistently repurchase shares with the substantial free cash flow it generates each year.”\n\n11. L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 37\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 20%\n\nL3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) ranks 11th on the list of stocks to sell according to Cathie Wood.

(NYSE:LHX), down from 44 funds in the last quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) is a defense contractor focused primarily on communications, surveillance and electronic warfare. We anticipate the US’s defense budget will be better than expected over the next few years as the Defense Department focuses on preparing for peer-level threats — an area in which LHX’s capabilities fit nicely. We believe there is room for improvement in recent execution — particularly at recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne — and we think LHX’s new management team is well-qualified to improve results. We accordingly capitalized on a recent share-price decline to initiate a position at what we consider a compelling valuation.”\n\n10. Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 21%\n\nXerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:XRX) is a global workplace technology company that integrates hardware, services, and software for enterprises worldwide.

Mark Coe’s Intrinsic Edge Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company.\n\n9. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 22%\n\nCyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) is one of the stocks to sell according to Cathie Wood. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) develops and sells software-based security solutions and services.

(NASDAQ:CYBR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n“IT accounted for several of the greatest detractors from strategy performance during the fourth quarter. Among these were Paylocity Holding Corp. (PCTY), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) and Q2 Holdings, Inc. (QTWO).\n\nA cybersecurity company that operates globally, CyberArk specializes in products and services to protect and safeguard customers’ IT networks and devices. A recent flurry of buyouts by private equity firms has fostered an active rumor mill that’s at times produced rapid gyrations in the prices of cybersecurity stocks. We suspect CyberArk may have been the target of some of this speculation during the third quarter. Moreover, the growing slate of security products offered by cloud-computing giants Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google may have bruised investor sentiment toward the group.”\n\n8. Taboola.com Ltd. (NASDAQ:TBLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nPercentage of Stake Discarded: 23%\n\nTaboola.com Ltd.

(NASDAQ:ADSK) has an attractive business model, indicating a recommendation for investors to continue buying shares into fiscal years 2025 and 2026.

(NASDAQ:ADSK) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK): Autodesk was our next top detractor despite quarterly results reported in late May that were in line with expectations. For 1Q, revenue grew 12%, Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) grew 15%, and the company generated $714 million of FCF, which increased 69% year over year. Profitability for the company was strong, with a 32% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter, and management reiterated its outlook for the year.\n\nAutodesk has a near monopoly on software for designing, building, and managing buildings, as well as software for infrastructure and manufacturing plants, prototyping software for manufacturers of products (including autos, machinery, and consumer products) and document sharing. As a result, we believe ADSK’s business is very sticky. The company expects to grow revenue mid-teens annually over the next several years, and, as we have seen in similar SaaS businesses, as revenue scales, operating margins are expected to expand significantly from their current 32% to more than 40%, more in-line with peers. We believe that ADSK shares can grow along with its mid-teens free cash flow growth over the next several years.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n14 Social Security Spousal Benefits and Loopholes You Need to Know 25 Countries with Most Gold Reserves in 2024 13 Biggest 401(k) Mistakes to Avoid\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Tech Stocks To Sell Right Now According To Cathie Wood is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Nvidia's CEO Says AI Is at a \"Tipping Point.\" Is the Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- garner the most attention from Wall Street.\n\nEach of these companies is playing a major role in rapid changes across e-commerce, cloud computing, consumer electronics, robotics, advertising, and more. But among the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia may be playing the most important role. The company's graphics processing units (GPU) are fueling applications across the generative AI spectrum -- from machine learning and quantum computing to data centers.\n\nDuring its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" With Nvidia stock up over 230% in the last year, some investors may be wondering what Huang meant, and if it's too late to buy shares.\n\nLet's dig into Nvidia's earnings report and assess the secular trends fueling demand for generative AI GPUs. While Nvidia stock is certainly enjoying the moment, investors may still come away inspired to buy shares now.\n\nNvidia's business is soaring\n\nOftentimes when a company is experiencing unprecedented demand, it will see soaring revenue -- and that's it. In other words, companies sometimes have to reinvest heavily into manufacturing in order to meet that higher demand. This can put a strain on operating margins and profits, even during times of accelerated sales growth.\n\nBut Nvidia is a rare breed, make no mistake about it. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nThe chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, net income, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last 10 years. Just look at how steep the slope of each line has become. Not only is the company generating robust top-line growth, but its profits and cash flows are growing in lockstep.\n\nTaking this a step further, Nvidia is not resting on its laurels. While demand for its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs remains strong, the company is investing its profits relentlessly into product innovation. The company is on track to begin shipments of next-generation chips, including the H200 in the second quarter. Moreover, reports suggest that Nvidia plans to release its most powerful chip to date, the B100, later in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe above trends underscore the fact that Nvidia's chips are in high demand. And with newer, improved models expected to reach customers soon, Nvidia's ride could just be getting started. Image Source: Getty Images\n\nThe AI revolution is just getting started\n\nAs use cases for AI continue to evolve, so do estimates about the total market size for the technology. A top Nvidia manager recently forecast that the market for AI-powered chips and software would grow to be worth $600 billion. The jury is still out on whether that prediction will prove accurate. However, what analysts are calling for in terms of growth can shed some light on Nvidia's potential. NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nWhile Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue of $61 billion is impressive, perhaps even more encouraging are its long-term growth prospects as estimated by Wall Street analysts. Given Nvidia's status as a market leader in AI GPUs, many clearly believe that the current demand trends can be sustained over the next few years.\n\nIs it too late to buy Nvidia stock?\n\nTo me, the biggest risk associated with Nvidia is not its valuation. Rather, I think the competitive landscape is going to become increasingly intense. Nvidia's top rival at the moment is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). However, both Amazon and Microsoft are already developing their own inference and training chips for generative AI models. While Nvidia may have a head start, investors should not turn their backs on its big tech cohorts. While I suspect it'll take a few years for other chips to acquire meaningful market share, Nvidia investors should be considering what other growth drivers the company has beyond AI GPUs.\n\nOne area that investors may be overlooking at the moment is Nvidia's opportunity in software. While the company is still primarily a hardware developer, Nvidia's software and services business reached a $1 billion revenue run rate during the fourth quarter.\n\nThis is a big deal for a couple of reasons. First, software tends to come with high margins. Should Nvidia begin to eventually lose share in the chip market, it's likely that its margins will take a hit. However, this could be more than offset if Nvidia continues to see success in software. Additionally, since software services are typically more predictable in terms of demand, I wouldn't be surprised to see investors apply even more of a premium to Nvidia stock in the future.\n\nAt a price-to-sales ratio of 32, Nvidia stock is trading much higher than its historical levels. However, the company's soaring revenue and profits, coupled with its steadfast reinvestment into new products and its budding software business, could warrant the premium. Given its differentiated business model, full-spectrum platform, and the secular tailwinds fueling AI, I think now is as good a time as ever to scoop up shares of Nvidia and hold them for the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Qualcomm Stock Is No Nvidia, But It’s Still a Buy",
        "content": "There’s no denying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the premier artificial intelligence (AI) stock. Trading just under $2 trillion, NVDA stock is worth more than the next five chipmakers combined. Over the past decade, an investment in the graphics processing units (GPU) maker returned almost 10 times more than the S&P 500. It doesn’t appear there is any letup in Nvidia’s growth either. Shares are up 60% in 2024 and we’re only two months into the year. The funny thing is, as recently as 2019 industry peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was worth more than its rival. QCOM stock had a $93 billion market capitalization compared to $86 billion for Nvidia. Of course, today the tables are reversed and QCOM stock hasn’t even doubled in value whereas NVDA is up 23-fold.\n\nThe divergence can be laid at the business choices they made. Qualcomm focused primarily on chips for smartphones while Nvidia, well, history shows where it went. Gaming GPUs turned into bitcoin mining and then to data centers and today into artificial intelligence. At each phase, the complex and demanding needs of the sector were met by Nvidia’s advanced chips.\n\nWhile Qualcomm may be a good investment (it is), can it ever hope to catch up to its rival ever again?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTough comparisons\n\nQualcomm reported strong fiscal first quarter results last month. Revenue rose 5% to $9.9 billion primarily due to 16% growth in its handset chip business. Sales there hit $6.7 billion. Computer chips for automobiles grew nearly twice as fast but it is Qualcomm’s smallest business with just $598 million in sales. The Internet of Things business suffered a 32% decline in sales to $1.1 billion.\n\nA few weeks later, Nvidia reported its own earnings and it’s a tough comparison for Qualcomm. For example, Nvidia’s data center business alone doubled Qualcomm’s entire sales effort as segment revenue surged 409% year over year. You can’t call Nvidia’s gaming revenue de minimis at $2.9 billion but it pales in comparison to data centers. Qualcomm’s operating earnings were a hefty $3 billion but they still fell well short of its rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is already clear the smartphone chipmaker has little chance of ever catching up to Nvidia. Unless there is some cataclysmic event that causes data centers and AI to crash and burn, Nvidia’s lead atop the chip market is fully sealed.\n\nBetter value but not a better opportunity\n\nYet don’t ignore the opportunity that QCOM stock represents. It has a somewhat better valuation profile than its rival. Qualcomm trades for just 14 times next year’s earnings estimates and 17 times the free cash flow (FCF) it produces versus 27 and 73 times, respectively, for Nvidia. Qualcomm is not sporting bargain-basement valuations but they are more attractive.\n\nYet that could be because Nvidia is expected to grow earnings at a 36% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) while Qualcomm’s earnings CAGR is just 8%. Solid but not earth-shaking. That’s because the market believes this AI boom is going to go on for an extended period while the smartphone upgrade cycle tends to be cyclical.\n\nThe winding down of Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 ramp weighed on Qualcomm’s performance but that is expected to change soon. Samsung with its Galaxy S24 smartphone should provide the next large ramp higher for the smartphone chipmaker as well as the ongoing recovery in China’s Android market. The automotive market is also picking up while its licensing business is supremely profitable.\n\nStill a good stock\n\nQualcomm won’t — and can’t — replace Nvidia though as a more reasonably priced stock it still represents a good, long-term investment. There are many paths to a profit and not everyone will be the whirlwind adventure Nvidia is. But you shouldn’t compare such singular events to the wider universe of stocks. QCOM stock is a solid company in its own right and should be seen on its own merits.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is far from over.\n\nThe most recent quarterly earnings results from AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are a testament to that. The chipmaker not only exceeded already astronomical revenue and earnings expectations, but its guidance beat Wall Street analysts' best guess, too.\n\nBut the competition is coming for Nvidia -- not only from other chipmakers but from some of its biggest customers. All the big tech companies buying Nvidia chips are also developing their own chip designs for AI. That makes an investment in Nvidia, especially at its current price, riskier than average. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's more, we'll eventually see a shift in the types of chips needed for AI. While companies are currently spending heavily to train AI models, eventually we'll need chips capable of running AI applications on the devices we use every day, like phones, laptops, and (just maybe) augmented reality headsets. And that's a whole different animal than the kinds of chips Nvidia is making.\n\nBut there's one company that can benefit from growing demand for all types of semiconductors from just about every chipmaker in the world. Its stock trades at a very attractive price compared to some soaring names in the AI semiconductor industry. That makes it a no-brainer buy in my book.\n\nThe one AI semiconductor stock to buy right now\n\nIf I could own just one semiconductor stock right now, it would be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). TSMC is the largest contract chip manufacturer in the world, and it boasts big clients including Nvidia and Apple.\n\nWhat makes TSMC an attractive company to own is that it has a sustainable competitive advantage. It's developed processes that only one other chip manufacturer can compete with, and it currently sits years ahead of the rest of the pack. That makes it the partner of choice for almost every chip designer developing leading-edge semiconductors.\n\nTSMC's advantage creates a virtuous cycle. Because it's able to manufacture chips for big companies like Nvidia and Apple at scale, it wins an outsize portion of contracts. That gives it the capital necessary to reinvest in the next-generation processes to win the next group of chip designs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, developing leading-edge chip manufacturing methods isn't just a matter of throwing more money at the challenge. There are numerous technical hurdles involved, and that requires management to prioritize the various areas where its processes could be improved. TSMC's longtime CEO, C.C. Wei, has done an exceptional job of that.\n\nAI will drive results in 2024 and beyond\n\nThe growing use of AI can only be sustainably supported by more powerful and energy-efficient chip designs. That requires leading-edge chips like the ones only TSMC is capable of producing. As a result, management believes \"the value of TSMC technology position is increasing, and we are all well positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI,\" as noted on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nThat's already playing out in the interest levels it's seeing for its next-generation N2 designs. Management said customer interest and engagement for N2 is much higher than it was for N3 (the current generation) at a similar stage of development. TSMC expects to start volume production for N2 in 2025, ramping up in 2026.\n\nExecutives see AI-related applications driving substantial growth for the business through 2027, going from a single-digit percentage of revenue today to the high teens. That guidance is an increase from previous comments that AI would account for a percentage of revenue in the low teens. When asked to confirm that high-teens guidance, Wei responded, \"Or higher.\"\n\nCompared to high-flying semiconductor stocks, TSMC is relatively cheap. Shares trade for 22.5 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 earnings. That's in line with the S&P 500. While the stock has produced exceptional returns at the start of the year thanks in part to its strong earnings results and favorable outlook, there's still room for the shares to climb higher as AI propels TSMC's growth long-term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon.com, NVIDIA, Energy Transfer, The Progressive and Synopsys",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 4, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Energy Transfer LP ET, The Progressive Corp. PGR and Synopsys Inc. SNPS.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop 5 Momentum Stocks for March After an Impressive February\n\nWall Street ended an impressive February, marking the fourth consecutive positive month for all three major stock indexes. Last month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – rallied 6.1%, 5.2% and 2.2%, respectively. In fact, the Dow posted its first four-month winning streak since May 2021.\n\nU.S. stock markets have maintained their northward journey in 2024 after witnessing an astonishing 2023. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – have advanced 3.4%, 7.5% and 9%, respectively.\n\nMomentum Likely to Continue\n\nThe Department of Commerce reported that the U.S. economy grew at a clip of 3.2% in fourth-quarter 2023, well above the initial consensus estimate of 2%. The U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Feb 29, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 3% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession.\n\nThe headline personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index rose 0.3% month over month in January and 2.4% annually. The December numbers were a rise of 0.1% month over month and 2.6% year over year.\n\nThe core PCE price index (excluding volatile food and energy items) rose 0.4% month over month and 2.8% annually in January, while the respective December numbers were 0.1% and 2.9%. Notably, the core PCE price index is the Fed’s most favored inflation gauge. The annual increase of the core PCE inflation rate in January was the lowest since February 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, personal income increased unexpectedly by 1% in January compared with the consensus estimate as well as December’s reading of 0.3%. Personal consumption expenditure increased 0.2% in January in line with the consensus estimate. However, the reading of January reflects a sharp decline from a 0.7% rise in December. The personal savings rate in January came in at 3.8%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently shows a 66.3% probability of the first cut of the existing Fed funds rate in the June FOMC meeting. The interest rate derivative tool also shows two more rate cuts by the end of 2024.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nAt this stage, it will be prudent to invest in momentum stocks. We have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital >$45 billion) that have strong momentum for February. These companies have strong potential for 2024 too.\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A or B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has benefited from the momentum in Prime and AWS. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips to China for security reasons.\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, suggesting an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current fiscal year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nEnergy Transfer LP owns and operates diversified portfolios of energy assets primarily in the United States. ET is a publicly traded limited partnership whose core operations include complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets, crude oil, natural gas liquids and refined product transportation and terminalling assets, NGL fractionation and various acquisition and marketing assets.\n\nEnergy Transfer has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 18.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe Progressive Corp. continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for PGR’s growth.\n\nPolicies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.\n\nPGR’s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $2.96 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38. The bottom line improved 97.3% year over year. Operating revenues of $16.6 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3% and increased 23.2% year over year.\n\nThe Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.7% and 45.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nSynopsys Inc. is benefiting from solid design wins due to a robust product portfolio. Growth in the hybrid working trend is driving demand for bandwidth. Strong traction for SNPS’ Fusion Compiler product is boosting its top line.\n\nThe growing demand for advanced technology, design, IP and security solutions is also creating solid prospects for SNPS. Moreover, the rising impact of artificial intelligence, 5G, the Internet of Things and big data is driving investments in new computer and machine-learning architectures.\n\nSynopsys has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.2% and 21.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Bought 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks, but This 1 Is Soaring the Most",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's largest semiconductor company, and considering it just surpassed a $2 trillion valuation, it's also one of America's most valuable companies overall as measured by market cap. Only Microsoft and Apple are more valuable.\n\nMost of Nvidia's market capitalization has been added in the last 12 months alone, thanks entirely to its data center chips designed to process artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. CEO Jensen Huang is often referred to as the \"Godfather of AI\" by Wall Street analysts, and now he's spreading his company's good fortune by investing in other AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe five AI stocks Nvidia owns shares in\n\nIn its first-ever 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, Nvidia revealed it purchased five AI stocks in the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31):\n\nArm Holdings, which helps the world's largest semiconductor companies design and develop their advanced computing chips. Nano-X Imaging, which uses AI to improve the efficiency of medical imaging to help patients achieve better outcomes. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which is using AI to reshape drug discovery. Tusimple Holdings, which develops advanced autonomous self-driving technologies for the trucking industry. SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI technologies.\n\nArm Holdings attracted the largest investment, with Nvidia's position worth over $147.3 million at the end of last year. However, Arm is only second-best in the group of five stocks when it comes to stock price performance in 2024, with a 104% gain so far.\n\nSoundHound AI is winning that race. Its stock is up an eye-watering 180% year-to-date, valuing the company at $1.5 billion. Nvidia's stake is relatively small with a value of just $10.1 million at SoundHound's current stock price ($5.83), but it hasn't stopped the buying frenzy among investors. So is it too late to follow Nvidia's lead?\n\nStory continues\n\nConversational AI is a game changer for businesses\n\nWhile many popular generative AI applications focus on ingesting text prompts to create text, image, and video content, SoundHound has developed conversational AI that understands voice and responds in kind.\n\nSoundHound's customer list includes some of the largest companies in the hospitality and automotive industries. Restaurant chains use conversational AI to take customer orders -- both in-store and in the drive-thru -- and also handle incoming phone queries, which reduces the workload on employees. Krispy Kreme and Jersey Mike's are just two of many SoundHound customers in that space.\n\nCar giants like Mercedes Benz and Stellantis (home to Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and other brands) use SoundHound's technology to create in-car virtual assistants capable of understanding each vehicle's functionality and answering a wide range of general queries.\n\nIn early February, SoundHound took those products to the next level with its \"Dynamic Interaction With Generative AI\" technology. It's a brand-new interface that responds to voice and touch prompts with audiovisual content, rather than just voice. It can decide when it's appropriate to include maps, internet search results, images, and videos in its responses to enhance the user experience.\n\nSoundHound AI experienced a surge in demand in 2023\n\nSoundHound only generated $45.9 million in revenue in 2023, although it was an impressive 47% increase compared to 2022.\n\nThe real story is the company's order backlog, which hit $661 million by the end of the year. That was double the backlog it had at the same time in 2022. Therefore, even though SoundHound's revenue is still relatively light, that backlog could translate to substantial growth in the years ahead.\n\nThere are signs of that in SoundHound's 2024 forecast. It expects to deliver $70 million in revenue for the year, which would see growth accelerate to 49%.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one negative factor investors need to be wary of. SoundHound lost $88.9 million on the bottom line in 2023, and while it isn't unusual for small tech enterprises to lose money while they scale up, this company only has $99.5 million in cash on hand, so it can't afford a repeat of last year.\n\nSoundHound will most likely need a cash infusion within the next couple of years. If it completes an equity offering, that will dilute existing investors and potentially dent its stock price.\n\nIs it too late to follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock?\n\nSoundHound AI stock soared by more than 60% on Feb. 15, when investors first learned of Nvidia's investment in the company. It jumped by a further 46% on Feb. 26, when Nvidia announced an expansion of its partnership with ServiceNow to improve the telecommunications industry using generative AI.\n\nTogether, Nvidia and ServiceNow will build generative AI solutions to elevate customer care and service assurance. While this deal makes no mention of SoundHound, conversational AI is the perfect technology to help service providers automate phone calls and resolve customer queries far more efficiently.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's recent investment in SoundHound stock, investors are speculating this deal could benefit the conversational AI specialist down the line. Plus, in the fourth quarter of last year, SoundHound said it received a \"notable, first-of-its-kind revenue contribution from a preeminent AI chip company.\" No specifics are provided, but the timing certainly lines up nicely with Nvidia's investment in SoundHound.\n\nFor now, SoundHound AI stock might simply be a speculative bet on the AI industry until it's in a more predictable financial position. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as investors understand it will probably carry more volatility than the average stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 4, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights BigBear.ai BBAI, Palantir PLTR, Super Micro Computer SMCI, SoundHound AI SOUN and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nWhat Are Some of the Lesser-Known A.I. Plays?\n\nBy now, the AI revolution is no secret to Wall Street. However, two under-the-radar, pure play AI stocks offer asymmetric reward-to-risk. In addition, these two up-and-comers have recently inked deals with AI juggernauts, offering a massive catalyst. Below are the two highest-impact AI partnerships:\n\nBigBear.ai & Palantir\n\nBigBear.ai and Palantir both offer decision intelligence solutions spanning national security, digital identity, supply chains and logistics, enterprise operations, and integration of manned-unmanned teaming within autonomous systems. On February 28th, BBAI and PLTR announced a strategic partnership combining AI-powered products with a next-generation operating platform. The partnership is a big deal for BBAI for two reasons:\n\n1.) BBAI has a market cap of just $600 million, while PLTR has a market cap of $54 billion. With PLTR as a partner, BBAI has an opportunity to throw gasoline on their growth.\n\n2.) PLTR is the undisputed leader in this niche space. If PLTR finds value in BBAI’s offering, it proves the quality of BBAI’s product suite. Also, PLTR may look to acquire the company down the line, should it be necessary.\n\nSwing to Profitably\n\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer have proven how much demand there is for the AI industry. However, few pure plays exist, and even fewer profitable ones. Last quarter, BBAI posted its first profitable quarter as a public company.\n\nWall Street is Bullish\n\nZacks Consensus Estimates suggest healthy EPS growth of 64.21% in 20223.\n\nBBAI is also gaining momentum from an EPS expectations perspective. Last quarter, BBAI beat analysts’ expectations by 142.86%.\n\nAccumulation Patterns\n\nOn February 27, shares jumped 38% on volume 10x the norm! The news was not apparent, but such heavy volume and price momentum indicate massive accumulation. The stock also forms a bullish and potentially explosive high-tight flag pattern.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI & Nvidia\n\nSOUN Overview\n\nSoundHound is a technology company that specializes in audio and voice recognition. One of its prominent products is the SoundHound app, which allows users to identify songs by listening to a snippet of music. Users can hum, sing, or type lyrics into the app, and it provides information about the song title, artist, and album. SOUN’s technology extends beyond music identification, incorporating voice-enabled AI solutions for various applications, including voice-controlled virtual assistants and integration into smart devices.\n\nWhy is the NVDA Investment Impactful?\n\nUntil now, NVDA has been selling the “picks and shovels” to the AI revolution. However, NVDA’s first 13F filing shows the company stepped out of its wheelhouse to purchase nearly $4 million worth of SOUN, showing the company also has ambitions for AI pure plays. Also, now that NVDA has the third largest market cap in the U.S., the company has plenty of cash to add exposure to their investment down the line – likely to keep a bid under SOUN shares.\n\nBullish EPS Surprise History\n\nThough SOUN has only been public since early 2022, the company has exhibited a strong tendency to beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations. SOUN has bested Zacks EPS Estimates in six of its first eight quarters.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best single digit stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our coverage of affordable stocks and how they, like all other stocks such as small cap and large cap stocks, benefit and suffer from the broader macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In.\n\nStocks can broadly be classified into three categories based on their market capitalization. Each of these represents firms whose shares operate with different dynamics within the broader market climate. The three primary stock categories are small, mid, and large caps, with the passage of time that has seen trillion dollar valuations the likes of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also created new categories commonly called mega cap stocks.\n\nSimilarly, the proliferation of computing products across the financial industry has made stock trading easier, leading to thousands of firms in categories such as micro and nano cap stocks. These stocks, which include firms whose shares trade in the single digits, are on the more 'affordable' end of the spectrum in literal terms. Single digit stocks are a small upgrade over the broader category of well known stocks that are called penny stocks. Typically, these stocks refer to firms whose shares trade below $5, and when we consider the general benefits and drawbacks of investing, single digit stocks, and penny stocks follow the same rules.\n\nBoth offer a higher potential for larger percentage returns via share price appreciation. Similarly, since penny stocks and single digit stocks belong to companies that receive little media coverage, the potential of scammers exploiting unwitting investors is high. This is because during the initial stage of a 'pump' during a typical scam, the shares of a single digit or penny stock appreciate much faster than the media can respond to determine if the performance is driven by underlying fundamentals or other legitimate tailwinds. Then, as more investors pile on, should the price drop, then most people end up losing their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, where there's risk there's a reward, and one key advantage that single digit stocks have over penny stocks is that since they also include firms whose shares trade between $5 and $10, the opportunities from profiting also increase with the growing comfort of a heftier share price. Additionally, another key benefit that is rather exclusive to single digit stocks is that they can often involve the shares of well established and sizeable foreign entities who also make their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) available for trading on American stock markets.\n\nThis trend is present predominantly in the banking sector, with foreign or ex-US banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG), Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG), and Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN) being apt examples. Each of these is a major player in the financial systems of their countries, with a role similar to U.S. banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).\n\nTherefore, investing in single digit stocks offers a chance of stability as well as profit taking. Continuing with our example of single digit banking stocks, MUFJ's shares are up by a respectable 16% year to date, despite the fact that Japan's economy, like other developed peers such as the United Kingdom and Germany, is not performing well. Similarly, even though Britain is officially in recession territory, Lloyd's stock has shed just 6% over the past twelve months and had the shares not dropped in January, then just like the British economy, the stock would also be nearly flat in growth terms.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best single digit stocks, it's important to also keep in mind recent stock market and economic news. With NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s blockbuster earnings out of the way, investors will now focus on interest rates and U.S. GDP growth - both of which are quite interlinked. Starting with the latter, S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), ahead of its flagship S&P 500 crossing the coveted 5,000 point barrier and setting a new record, also upgraded its forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2024. The ratings agency now believes that the American economy will grow by 2.4% in 2024, for a significant upward revision over the previous estimate of 1.5%. As this would hint on its own, the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes also show that the central bank is worried about cutting rates too soon rather than too late.\n\nSo, with single digit stocks offering the promise of returns and stability, we decided to look at what stocks hedge funds are buying. Some notable picks are Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG). 12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close up of hands counting a vast stack of money in a bank vault.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best single digit stocks to buy, we ranked the 60 most valuable single digit stocks in terms of market capitalization by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of December 2023. Out of these, the single digit stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were chosen.\n\nFor these best single digit stocks, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In\n\n12. Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 32\n\nGarrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX) is an American car parts manufacturer that sells performance products like turbos for cars and air compressors for industrial use. It marks a slow start to our list of the best single digit stocks by having beaten analyst EPS estimates in only one of its four latest quarters.\n\nInsider Monkey dug through 933 hedge funds for their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings to find out that 32 had invested in the firm. The largest Garrett Motion Inc. (NASDAQ:GTX)  shareholder in our database is Howard Marks's Oaktree Capital Management courtesy of its $426 million stake.\n\nAlong with, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.

Amidst a tumultuous run on the earnings front that has seen the firm miss estimates several times, the shares received a boost in February 2024 when Bank of America upgraded them to Buy from Neutral and cited the potential for Marqeta, Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ)'s top line to grow by 20%.\n\nBy the end of 2023's December quarter, 32 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought a stake in Marqeta, Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ). Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies was the firm's biggest hedge fund shareholder since it owned $76 million worth of shares.\n\n10. Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 33\n\nNewell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) is a diversified consumer goods firm that sells products like coffee and cleaning items. Unlike Marqeta, whose shares soared in 2024, Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL)'s fell to record lows in February 2024 after its full year earnings guidance disappointed investors.\n\nAs of December 2023 end, 33 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research had held a stake in the firm. Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL)'s largest stakeholder among these is Richard S. Pzena's Pzena Investment Management due to its $469 million investment.\n\n9. Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 33\n\nClarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT) is a sizeable British technology company that allows researchers and others to consolidate, analyze, and work with their data. A key stock to watch amidst the current AI wave, its shares are rated Buy on average but the average analyst share price target offers no upside.\n\nFor their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 33 out of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had bought and owned Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT)'s shares. Leonard Green's Leonard Green & Partners was the biggest investor since it owned $1 billion worth of shares.\n\n8. BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 34\n\nBGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC) is an American brokerage that deals in a wide variety of investment products and securities. It's one of the more interesting stocks on our list of the best single digit stocks since while the shares soared after BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC) announced record earnings results in February 2024, they ended up reversing all the gains a week later.\n\nDuring December 2023, 34 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research held a stake in BGC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BGC).\n\n7. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q4 2023: 36\n\nKinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) is a Canadian gold company with operations in the U.S., Canada, and other countries. With gold seeing increased demand all over the world over the past twelve months, Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) has done well on the earnings front by having beaten analyst EPS estimates in all four of its latest quarters.\n\nBy the end of 2023's final quarter, 36 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were the firm's shareholders. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC)'s largest hedge fund stakeholder is Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies due to its $178 million stake.\n\n6.

Even though the firm sought to woo investors with a share repurchase program, its full year 2023 earnings report still led to a sizeable share price drop due to a $2.75 billion 2024 revenue guidance that fell short of analyst estimates.\n\nAfter digging through 933 hedge fund portfolios for last year's fourth quarter, Insider Monkey found that 37 had bought and owned Grab Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GRAB)'s shares. Chase Coleman and Feroze Dewan's Tiger Global Management LLC was the biggest investor since it owned $172 million worth of shares.\n\nSouthwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN), Grab Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GRAB)Warner Bros.

        "content": "Cathie Wood is the founder and chief investment officer at Ark Invest, an asset management company focused on disruptive innovation. Ark manages several thematic index funds built around burgeoning technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), but the firm continued to sell down its position in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) throughout February.\n\nThat may strike readers as strange given that Nvidia graphics processing units are synonymous with AI infrastructure. But the stock has advanced 236% over the past year, so Ark is taking profits and reinvesting capital into other AI companies. For instance, the firm bought shares of Pinterest(NYSE: PINS) throughout February. The social media company now accounts for a little more than 1% of Ark's $14 billion portfolio.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nPinterest failed to impress with its fourth-quarter results\n\nPinterest reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter. Global monthly active users (MAUs) increased 11% to 498 million and average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 2% to $2.00. Wall Street analysts anticipated slightly slower MAU growth, but slightly faster ARPU growth.\n\nAs a result, Pinterest missed top-line estimates. Revenue increased 12% to $981 million, but Wall Street was looking for $991 million. Despite that shortfall, the company beat bottom-line estimates due to effective expense management. GAAP net income reached $201 million in the fourth quarter, up from $17 million in the prior year.\n\nPinterest shares declined about 10% following the release of the report, and the stock is still 60% below the record high it reached in early 2021. But the company is executing on a sensible growth strategy by investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and partnering with third-party advertisers. Those moves could create value for patient shareholders in the years ahead.\n\nPinterest is executing on a sensible growth strategy\n\nPinterest operates a social media platform that lets users explore and curate visual content to discover new products and ideas. Its monthly user base trails that of Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok, and Snap's Snapchat, but Pinterest still ranks among the 15 largest ad tech companies in the world. That positioning is a product of its ability to collect consumer data and influence shopping decisions, and ongoing investments in AI help make that possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said:\n\nNearly a year ago, we began moving to next-gen AI capabilities, enabling us to use recommender models that were 100x larger than before. We combined our first-party proprietary data with our AI-based computer vision and search technologies to improve perceived relevance for recommendations on related pins, driving perceived relevance up by nearly 10 points from a year ago to 94%.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Pinterest added generative AI search guides to help users refine queries and take action (make purchases) more easily. It also debuted an AI-powered organization feature that automates content curation for users. Management says those innovations create a powerful flywheel. Specifically, Pinterest's ability to make relevant recommendations improves as user engagement improves, simply because engagement creates data the company can feed into its machine learning models.\n\nIn addition to AI innovation, Pinterest has partnered with Amazon and Alphabet's Google to bring third-party advertising to its platform. Specifically, Amazon ads are live in the U.S. on Pinterest search and the home feed, and Google ads are live in international markets. Those partnerships let Pinterest tap advertising demand beyond its own ecosystem, and its partnership with Amazon in particular makes it easier for users to buy products they see on the platform.\n\nPinterest stock trades at a reasonable price\n\nGoing forward, digital ad spending is projected to grow at 15% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. How quickly Pinterest grows depends on its ability to generate demand among advertisers, which itself depends on its ability to engage users with relevant content and drive desirable outcomes for brands.\n\nOn that front, management is making sensible decisions that could lead to market share gains. Wall Street expects Pinterest to grow sales at 15% annually over the next five years, so that consensus estimate leaves room for upside if the company does indeed gain share. In either case, its current valuation of 8.2 times sales seem reasonable.\n\nAs a caveat, Pinterest faces tough competition from larger, more popular social networks that could siphon advertising dollars away from its platform. But unlike Pinterest, those competing platforms are not purpose-built for product discovery.\n\nIn other words, Pinterest is undoubtedly an underdog, but it also has unique strengths that could make it more effective in driving social commerce. If the company harnesses that potential, it could create substantial value for patient shareholders. Investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in Pinterest today. Personally, I like Ark's decision to allocate about 1% of its portfolio to the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pinterest right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Pinterest, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pinterest wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could, by some definitions, arrive in as little as five years.\n\nHuang, who leads the world's leading maker of artificial intelligence chips used to create systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, appeared at an economic forum held at Stanford University where he was asked about how long it would take to achieve AGI with computers capable of thinking like humans.\n\nHe responded that the answer largely depends on how the goal of AGI is defined. If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said that AGI will arrive soon.\n\n\"If I gave an AI… every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one,\" Huang said.\n\nNVIDIA CEO IS $9.6B RICHER AS AI CHIPMAKER'S STOCK SOARS Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA holding the Grace hopper superchip CPU used for generative AI at supermicro keynote presentation during the COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers.\n\nCurrently, AI can pass tests like legal bar exams but has struggled on specialized medical tests like gastroenterology.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nBased on other definitions of AGI, Huang said it may be much farther away because there is still disagreement among scientists about how to describe how human minds work.\n\n\"Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer\" because engineers need defined goals, Huang said.\n\nNVIDIA'S STOCK SOARS AFTER AI BOOM LIFTS REVENUE 265% Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang says the timing of AGI depends on how it's defined.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO also addressed a question about how many more chip factories, called \"fabs\" in the industry, are needed to support the expansion of the AI industry.\n\nMedia reports have indicated that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks many more fabs will be needed, and he has pursued funding for an AI chip venture.\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Nvidia's role as the leading designer of AI chips has driven massive growth in its stock price.\n\nHuang said that more fabs will be needed but noted that each chip will also get better over time, which limits the number of chips required by customers.\n\n\"We're going to need more fabs. However, remember that we're also improving the algorithms and the processing of (AI) tremendously over time,\" Huang said. \"It's not as if the efficiency of computing is what it is today, and therefore the demand is this much. I'm improving computing by a million times over 10 years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia recently surpassed the threshold of $2 trillion in market capitalization, surpassing Google parent company Alphabet's $1.71 trillion and Amazon's $1.85 trillion to become the third-largest U.S. company by market cap – trailing only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nNvidia's stock is up 70.8% so far in 2024. The AI chip giant's share price has risen by 244% over the past year and 2,084% in the past five years.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI could pass most human tests in 5 years",

NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, a key statement from Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the company's earnings conference call suggests that it can sustain its terrific growth for a much longer period: \"We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference.\"\n\nLet's dive into the details.\n\nAI inferencing could help Nvidia maintain its supremacy in this lucrative market\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) shot into the limelight once it was evident that they are playing a mission-critical role in training large language models (LLMs), which form the backbone of popular generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. Multiple cloud service providers have lined up to get their hands on Nvidia's GPUs to train their AI models and bring generative AI services to the market. As a result, Nvidia controls a whopping 90% share of the AI training chip market.\n\nAs it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's flagship H100 AI GPU is so strong that customers are willing to wait between 36 and 52 weeks to get their hands on this piece of hardware. Nvidia is shoring up its supply capacity to meet that solid demand, and that explains why the company is expected to keep growing at a terrific pace and more than double its revenue by fiscal 2027 as compared to fiscal 2024's reading of $60.9 billion.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, Kress' comment that 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue is coming from selling chips used for AI inference applications suggests that it could keep up its eye-popping growth for a very long time. That's because AI inference chips are expected to account for the majority of the overall AI chip market. According to technology news and analysis provider TechSpot, inference is expected to account for 45% of the AI chip market, while AI training chips will account for 15% of this space in the future.\n\nThat's not surprising, as once an AI model is trained using general-purpose computing chips such as graphics cards, which Nvidia sells, it will be put to use to generate results using new data sets. This process of generating results from an already trained AI model is known as inferencing. By 2030, Verified Market Research estimates that the demand for AI inference chips could jump from an estimated $16 billion in 2023 to almost $91 billion in 2030.\n\nBased on Kress' statement, Nvidia sold $19 billion worth of AI inference chips last year (40% of its total data center revenue of $47.5 billion for the year). That's higher than the $16 billion revenue estimate from Verified Market Research. This means that Nvidia is dominating the AI inference market already, and the potential revenue opportunity bodes well for the company's future.\n\nIf the AI inference chip market indeed generates $90 billion in revenue as Verified Market Research estimates, then Nvidia's data center revenue could keep growing nicely through the end of the decade and supercharge its overall business.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia is taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in the AI inference space with a potential move into custom chips, formally known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips are specifically designed for AI inference purposes thanks to their computing power and low power consumption. According to third-party estimates, the market for custom chips used for inferencing could jump from an estimated $30 billion in 2023 to $50 billion in 2025.\n\nIn all, it is easy to see why analysts are forecasting outstanding growth for Nvidia.\n\nThe valuation makes the stock an enticing buy\n\nNvidia's earnings and revenue are set to increase rapidly in the coming years. The market should ideally reward Nvidia stock with handsome gains if it can indeed deliver on that front.\n\nThat's why buying this AI stock right now looks like a no-brainer, especially considering its forward earnings multiple of 33 is currently lower than its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39. Meanwhile, Nvidia remains extremely cheap when you look at its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio).\n\nThe PEG ratio is calculated by dividing a company's P/E ratio by the estimated annual earnings growth it could deliver. As the following chart shows, Nvidia's PEG ratio is way below 1, the reading below which a stock is considered to be undervalued. NVDA PEG Ratio Chart\n\nAll this means that investors are still getting a good deal on Nvidia despite its big surge in the past year, and they should consider buying this AI stock hand over fist given the moves it is making to ensure solid growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index is off to a strong start in 2024 with gains of 11% so far. That's not surprising as some of its key components such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have already jumped nicely thanks to their solid earnings reports -- which have revealed that these companies are benefiting from the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nHowever, there's one PHLX Semiconductor Sector component that has failed to step on the gas thus far: Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU). Shares of the memory manufacturer are up just 5% in 2024. However, a recent development has given Micron stock a nice boost. Shares of the chipmaker jumped 4% on Feb. 26.\n\nLet's see why that happened and check why this semiconductor stock could go on a bull run following this development.\n\nSupplying chips for Nvidia's next-gen AI GPU\n\nIn a press release dated Feb. 26, Micron pointed out that it has commenced the volume production of its high bandwidth memory 3E (HBM3E) chip. The company added that this particular chip \"will be part of NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which will begin shipping in the second calendar quarter of 2024.\" Micron claims that HBM3E consumes 30% less power than what competitors offer.\n\nIt is not surprising to see Micron landing the HBM spot in Nvidia's upcoming processors. In its December 2023 earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that its HBM3E chip was in the final stages of qualification with Nvidia. Now that the company has won this business from Nvidia, it seems on its way to achieving its target of generating \"several hundred millions of dollars of HBM revenue in fiscal 2024.\"\n\nThe good thing for Micron is that demand for Nvidia's upcoming H200 processors is already solid. Nvidia management remarked on its latest earnings call that demand for its next-generation products will be greater than supply. So the possibility of Micron selling out its entire output of HBM3E chips cannot be ruled out, especially considering that fellow memory manufacturer SK Hynix has already sold out its HBM inventory for 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore importantly, Micron is reportedly boosting its HBM production capacity so that it can serve the growing demand for this memory type not only from Nvidia but also from other customers. In November 2023, the chipmaker reportedly opened a new facility dedicated to producing HBM3E on a mass scale. It is also worth noting that Micron is working on a bigger HBM3E memory size that could be rolled out next month.\n\nAll this indicates that the company is on track to make the most of the growing demand for HBM, a product that is in tremendous demand thanks to its deployment in AI processors. Market research firm Yole Group estimates that the HBM market could generate an annual revenue of almost $20 billion in 2025, up from $5.5 billion last year and an estimated $14.1 billion in 2024. By 2029, global HBM revenue is expected to jump to $38 billion.\n\nAs such, Micron could win big from this market in the long run, especially considering that it has already landed a significant customer in the form of Nvidia, which dominates the global AI chip market hands down. Not surprisingly, Micron's top-line growth is set to accelerate significantly in fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026. MU Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nBig stock upside could be in the cards\n\nAs the chart above indicates, Micron's revenue is expected to jump to almost $23 billion in fiscal 2024. That would be a big increase over the fiscal 2023 reading of $15.5 billion. By fiscal 2026, Micron's top line is expected to close in on the $35 billion mark, which means that the company is expected to more than double its revenue in the space of just three fiscal years.\n\nMicron is currently trading at 6 times sales. While that's higher than the S&P 500 index's sales multiple of 2.8, the potential growth that this AI stock could deliver means that it seems worthy of a premium valuation. That's especially true considering that other chipmakers benefiting from AI adoption are trading at higher sales multiples.\n\nSo, if Micron Technology maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 6 after three years and indeed delivers $35 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2026, its market capitalization could jump to $210 billion. That would be a 112% increase from current levels, which is why investors should consider buying this chipmaker before its stock market rally gains momentum.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Up More Than 200% to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has grabbed investors' attention thanks to its potential to revolutionize so many industries, from healthcare to automotive. In fact, some researchers predict the size of the AI market could soar past $1 trillion by 2030. So, investors have bought shares of possible winners, including those powering AI models and companies using AI to improve their operations.\n\nThis has produced explosive gains in some stocks, which may prompt you to wonder if, in some cases, many years worth of anticipated good news is priced into shares at their current levels. That's a valid question, and it's clear that, as with any new, high-growth area, some gainers don't have what it takes to keep up the pace.\n\nBut there are some that do. In fact, two top AI stocks that have climbed more than 200% over the past year seem unstoppable. And that means it's a great idea to buy these potential winners and hold onto them for the long term. Their gains may just be getting started. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) leaped into the spotlight as it became the go-to company for the essential ingredient to power AI: the chip. The company is far from being new to designing chips, though.\n\nNvidia developed graphics processing units (GPUs) years ago, and they became the standard for the gaming industry. Their ability to handle many processing tasks simultaneously made them the crucial ingredient for all of the visual elements involved in powering games -- and a few years down the road, this same ability made GPUs critical for powering AI too.\n\nToday, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and the company's reputation, full suite of products and services, and rising investment in research and development mean it's likely to stay ahead. Nvidia's earnings over the past year show an impressive pace of growth, with annual revenue and net income rising by triple-digit percentages. Revenue has set records quarter after quarter, led by the company's data center unit, which includes its AI offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also important to note Nvidia's products are in use by all of the major cloud platforms, meaning the company is able to reach customers through services they know and trust -- and these cloud platforms work to sell Nvidia products to these customers.\n\nEven considering Nvidia's enormous gains over the past year and a half, the company only trades for 31 times forward earnings estimates, a reasonable price considering Nvidia's dominance in the market and the growth prospects ahead.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nBusinesses of all kinds own loads of data that, if collected and managed properly, could be extremely valuable for their operations. This is where Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) comes in. The software company helps corporate and government clients aggregate data and use it to make key decisions. And AI plays a central role in the process.\n\nLast year, Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), and business has been booming. In the company's most recent letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp referred to AIP as the future of Palantir, and said it has already driven gains in revenue and customers. Palantir's manner of introducing AIP to potential customers is particularly clever -- the company hosts \"bootcamps\" to highlight its services and show individual companies how AIP could be a game-changer for them.\n\nPalantir once was known largely for serving governments, but these days, it has put its focus on growing its commercial business, and those efforts are bearing fruit. In the fourth quarter, Palantir's commercial revenue growth outpaced government revenue growth -- with a 32% gain versus an 11% gain. And U.S. commercial revenue, in particular, took off, climbing 70% year over year.\n\nNow let's talk valuation. Palantir's might seem lofty at 74 times forward earnings estimates, but I'd be willing to pay a premium for this stock, knowing the company is in the process of making an important shift toward increasing its commercial business and growing its newly launched AIP service.\n\nHere, it's key to imagine potential a few years down the road. And from that angle, considering the momentum in commercial customers and AIP, Palantir looks like a clear buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be the Next Nvidia",
        "content": "Finding the next great stock, like an Amazon or, more recently, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), is the dream -- one stock that can generate portfolio- and life-changing returns, sometimes very quickly. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has given investors its best Nvidia impression. The stock is up a whopping 750% over the past year.\n\nNow, a stock rarely goes up that much, that quickly. That's why it might seem wild that I'm predicting it will continue. Of course, success may not be a straight line. Still, I believe Supermicro, as it is better known these days, could easily mimic Nvidia's epic multiyear run and soar upward over the coming years.\n\nSupermicro is becoming the market leader in its field\n\nThe recipe for Supermicro's success is simple. Dominant leadership in a rapidly growing industry equals outperformance. Investors are already seeing the equation play out, which helps explain the stock's remarkable success. My prediction is based on the simple theory that artificial intelligence (AI) spending will continue well into the future.\n\nFirst, the basics. Supermicro is a computing hardware innovator. It began with motherboards in the early 1990s but today sells turn-key modular server systems to corporations. Do you know how to build a computer from scratch? Neither do many companies. So, like most would do, they turn to an expert like Supermicro.\n\nSupermicro's modular system can be easily scaled to the size a company needs and can be built upon in the future if needs grow. Like Nvidia's AI chips, customers are flocking to Supermicro for their AI needs: Image source: Super Micro Computer.\n\nManagement is basing this on its internal data and industry data from Gartner. Supermicro's revenue grew 103% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), and guidance is for up to 218% year-over-year growth in the current quarter.\n\nA rapidly growing industry\n\nThe million-dollar question, of course, is whether this can last. According to the people most connected to AI, it can and will. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently made headlines for his call to expand global chip capacity, claiming a need to invest trillions of dollars for the cause. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted an additional $1 trillion in data center spending over the next several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf these predictions are remotely accurate, Supermicro, which just did $3.7 billion in revenue in Q2, is poised to have more opportunities than it can shake a stick at. Ultimately, this has to play out, and an inability to support demand could send business to Supermicro's competitors. However, it's hard to see how Super Micro Computer doesn't have every opportunity to fulfill these skyrocketing expectations for long-term growth.\n\nA surprisingly reasonable valuation\n\nGiven the abovementioned situation, it's reasonable to expect growth estimates to rise. That's happened already. Analysts are looking for earnings growth averaging 48% annually over the long term. This seems realistic for a company now growing at a triple-digit rate.\n\nAt a forward P/E ratio of just 40, Supermicro's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is less than 1, signaling that the stock is still a bargain for its expected future growth potential. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThere's a fascinating psychological phenomenon called anchoring bias, in which the mind sticks to the first number it sees. In other words, investors see how much Supermicro has climbed over the past year and assume that the stock must be expensive. To be fair, most stocks are overpriced if they rise that much in a year.\n\nHowever, data shows that Supermicro could be the exception. Now, there are investment risks because you are projecting things in the future. Nothing is guaranteed in life. However, the data and recent financial performance indicate a bright future for Super Micro Computer and its shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Be Worth $1 Trillion Someday",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world. It goes far beyond OpenAI's ChatGPT and other chatbots. AI will personalize products and ads to customers. It will enable humans to work smarter and faster and may even perform certain tasks so people don't have to.\n\nAccording to a PricewaterhouseCoopers study, AI could contribute almost $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. That means the investment opportunity extends beyond Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and other big technology companies.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors have identified Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW), Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) as winners with the potential to grow to become trillion-dollar stocks someday. Here's what you need to know about these three AI stocks with trillion-dollar potential.\n\nSnowflake has partnered with Nvidia on generative AI\n\nJustin Pope (Snowflake): Nvidia has become the household name in artificial intelligence (AI), but don't overlook Snowflake. The data cloud company partnered with Nvidia last summer on generative AI. Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform on which customers can store, organize, share, and query their data. Snowflake's tie-up with Nvidia is a big deal because the latter is the industry AI chip leader, which should funnel business to Snowflake as corporations integrate AI into their business.\n\nToday, Snowflake has a $75 billion market cap. The business is doing $2.7 billion in annual revenue. Snowflake is scooping up business from top corporations, including 691 of the Forbes Global 2,000. Thanks to a usage-based billing model, its 131% net revenue retention signals that customers spend more on the platform over time.\n\nThe long-term growth opportunity is tremendous. The world is increasingly digital and creating more and more data over time. That feeds into Snowflake's growth and doesn't figure to change. AI models in the future will probably train on more data as AI gets more intelligent and more capable.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnowflake's CEO recently retired, but the former CEO wasn't a founder. Investors should monitor the new CEO's performance but not let this recent development scare them away from the stock. The company is established and spreading its roots deep into the corporate sector. Data could become one of the great investing trends of the future, so Snowflake is as good a bet as any to become one of the next great megacap tech companies.\n\nPalantir's market cap could eventually crack the $1 trillion mark\n\nJake Lerch (Palantir Technologies):With a current market cap of around $54 billion, Palantir has a long way to go before cracking the $1 trillion mark. I wouldn't expect it to do so in the next decade. However, that doesn't mean Palantir won't eventually scale the $1 trillion mountain -- or that it's a bad stock to own.\n\nPalantir is a software company specializing in AI-powered big data analytics. Although the company first found a market for its services with government intelligence agencies and the defense industry -- partnerships it still maintains today -- Palantir's future depends on its ability to win over commercial clients.\n\nAnd the company appears to be making significant headway on that front. In its latest quarter (the three months ended on Dec. 31, 2023), Palantir's commercial customer count grew to 497. Moreover, revenue derived from U.S. commercial clients grew 70% from a year earlier to $131 million. Nevertheless, government revenue still outpaces commercial revenue:\n\nSegment Fiscal Year 2023 Growth Rate (YOY) Government revenue $1.2 billion 14% Commercial revenue $1.0 billion 20%\n\nData source: Palantir Technologies. YOY = Year over year.\n\nHowever, as more and more businesses sign up with Palantir, that's likely to change. As Palantir CEO Alex Karp has put it, \"Obviously, our performance in U.S. commercial is extraordinary, some would say bombastic.\"\n\nIn any event, the AI revolution shows no signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. And as more organizations look to AI for analysis and cost savings, Palantir stands ready to sign them up as new customers. As that happens, expect Palantir's market cap to climb. Perhaps -- eventually -- all the way to $1 trillion.\n\nWhen it comes to AI chips, Nvidia is not the only game in town\n\nWill Healy(Advanced Micro Devices): When it comes to the AI chip market, Nvidia is dominant, claiming at least 80% of the market, according to analyst estimates. The insatiable demand for this type of semiconductor has taken Nvidia to an approximately $2 trillion market cap. It has also led customers to look elsewhere for such chips, and the company best positioned for second place is likely to be Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nAs a leader in CPUs, GPUs, and data centers, the company is well suited for this role, and it recently leveraged this expertise by releasing its AMD Instinct MI300 Series Accelerators to meet this demand. The MI300A combines the CPU and GPU in one unit, while its MI300X chip is the most advanced generative AI accelerator, according to the company.\n\nMoreover, Allied Market Research forecasts the AI chip market will reach $384 billion by 2032, a compound annual growth rate of 38%! Thus, AI chipmakers should benefit across the board.\n\nCurrently, the data center and AI segment makes up around $6.5 billion of AMD's revenue, about 29%. Additionally, AMD is prominent in the client, gaming, and embedded segments, and combined, they made up over $16 billion of AMD's nearly $23 billion in revenue in 2023. Hence, these segments will contribute to the company's growth, though probably at a slower pace than AI.\n\nAs conditions stand now, it has reached a market cap of around $300 billion, meaning the stock has to rise by about 3.3 times to reach a $1 trillion market cap. This looks like an attainable goal. Analysts project 36% higher profits in 2024, with an additional 51% increase next year. Also, its forward P/E ratio is about 48.\n\nSuch a valuation is high, but it's far from bubble levels, indicating AMD could achieve a $1 trillion market cap organically.

        "title": "Could Nvidia Deliver Another 5X Gain by 2030? Here's Why It's Not Out of the Question.",
        "content": "No stock is more magnificent right now than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). That's a subjective statement, of course, but it's one based on objective reality.\n\nName any big company. There's a better chance than not that it has artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives underway. And if so, it's a near certainty that the company is using Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nI'd argue that Nvidia is the most important business in the world -- at least for now. Its stock performance backs me up. The share price has skyrocketed over 400% in less than three years and is up by a multiple of more than 20 over the last five years. That's indisputably magnificent.\n\nBut could Nvidia deliver another fivefold gain by 2030? Here's why it's not out of the question.\n\nAn impossible dream?\n\nI can hear the objections already. Several of them have already entered my mind, too. Nvidia becoming a five-bagger yet again by the end of the decade might seem like an impossible dream.\n\nOne key problem is the fact that success attracts competition. We're already seeing that with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices has launched its new MI300 Instinct chips. The most powerful of these new AI chips, MI300X, beat Nvidia's H100 on key benchmarks, according to AMD. It's also drastically cheaper than Nvidia's chip.\n\nSome of Nvidia's biggest customers have gotten into the act as well. Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla have either already developed their own AI chips or are in the process of doing so.\n\nThe demand for GPUs could slow even without additional competition. For example, if companies see that investments in AI aren't paying off as much as anticipated, they'll shift spending to other areas.\n\nHow Nvidia could deliver a 5x gain by 2030\n\nThese are just a few valid objections to the premise that Nvidia could deliver a 5x gain by 2030. However, I still think it's within the realm of possibility.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst of all, I suspect that companies' AI investments will pay off handsomely. As long as the return on investment is attractive, AI spending will increase.\n\nNvidia could realistically skyrocket another 400% or more even with increased competition if the demand for AI chips grows enough. But how much will that demand grow? I found Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's comments in the company's recent fourth-quarter conference call intriguing.\n\nHuang pointed to the transition from general computing to accelerated computing and the adoption of generative AI as huge tailwinds for his company. He predicted that these two trends \"will drive a doubling of the world's data-center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\" He also hinted that \"amazing breakthroughs in large language models\" could be on the way from Nvidia.\n\nKeep in mind that Nvidia's revenue totaled $60.9 billion last year and that the current installed base of data center infrastructure is around $1 trillion. If the company could increase its annual revenue to the levels that Huang envisions, a 5x return doesn't sound far-fetched.\n\nPossible doesn't necessarily mean probable\n\nThere is one other factor to consider, though. The current share price already has a lot of growth baked in. The stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 31.8.\n\nAswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University who is known as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" says he is selling Nvidia stock because of its lofty price. Damodaran expects Nvidia to deliver strong growth, but he's skeptical that the company will be able to grow at a rate anywhere close enough to justify its current valuation. However, the valuation expert admits that AI could prove to be a bigger tailwind for Nvidia than he projected in his model.\n\nWill Nvidia deliver another 5x gain by 2030? I don't know. Just because something is possible doesn't necessarily mean that it's probable. On the other hand, I agree with Huang that \"the world has reached the tipping point of a new computing era.\" Maybe, just maybe, his company will become even more magnificent than it already is.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tech war: Huawei's AI chip capabilities under intense scrutiny after market leader Nvidia taps it as potential rival",
        "content": "The closely-guarded semiconductor capabilities of US-sanctionedHuawei Technologies have come under fresh scrutiny after Nvidia identified the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant as a potential rival in artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the first time.\n\nWith Nvidia currently unable to ship its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to mainland China under Washington's export restrictions, a new AI chipset from Huawei has emerged as a replacement for the US firm's Chinese products, industry insiders and analysts say.\n\nThe Huawei Ascend 910B, already available via distributor channels on the mainland, is considered by some industry participants to be on par in terms of computing power with Nvidia's sought-after A100 data-centre GPUs. Huawei has not made any public comment on the 910B.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Ascend 910B is believed to succeed the Ascend 910, which was released by Huawei in August 2019, three months after it was put on a trade blacklist by the US Commerce Department. The chip can compete with Nvidia's A100 in terms of powering AI algorithms, according to Dylan Patel, chief analyst at San Francisco-based semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis.\n\nA Chinese flag is seen near the logo atop Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp's headquarters in Shanghai. The country's top contract chip maker is said to be the supplier of Huawei Technologies' new artificial intelligence chipset, the Ascend 910B.

The country's top contract chip maker is said to be the supplier of Huawei Technologies' new artificial intelligence chipset, the Ascend 910B. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It [the Ascend 910B] is a bit above the A100 theoretically,\" Patel said, adding that the chip is fabricated by China's top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), on a 7-nanometre process.\n\nUS sanctions since 2019 have restricted Huawei's semiconductor development and dealt a severe blow to its smartphone business. But the Shenzhen-based company has been quietly bolstering its chip business by partnering with various domestic suppliers, according to several people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nHuawei showed its resilience in August last year, when it surprised the industry with the Mate 60 Pro, the company's first 5G smartphone release since the Mate 40 series in October 2020. Sales of the new handset propelled Huawei back to the top of the domestic smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nThe SMIC-made Kirin 9000s processor that powers the Mate 60 Pro sparked intense industry speculation over how Huawei managed to overcome a blanket US chip ban.\n\nA Kirin 9000s processor, developed by Huawei Technologies chip design arm HiSilicon, is taken from a Mate 60 Pro 5G smartphone in Ottawa, capital of Canada, on September 3, 2023.

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nAt the domestic release of the Ascend 910, Huawei touted the chip at the time as \"the world's most powerful AI processor\", fabricated by the world's top contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, using a 7-nm process.\n\nHuawei's new AI chip appears to have emerged around the same time as the Mate 60 Pro's release last August. Chinese online search and AI giant Baidu ordered 1,600 of Huawei's Ascend 910B chips in the same month, according to a Reuters report in November 2023 that cited a source.\n\nTwo weeks before Reuters published that report, Chinese AI company iFlytek launched its Feixing One computing platform based on Huawei's Ascend chips. This means the iFlytek Spark 3.0, the firm's updated large language model (LLM), may have been developed on AI chips. LLMs are the technology used to train generative AI services like ChatGPT.\n\nHuawei declined to comment on the matter.\n\nJensen Huang, the co-founder, president and chief executive of US chip design firm Nvidia, attends a session of the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on February 12, 2024.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nIn an interview with tech media outlet Wired last month, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang described Huawei as a \"really, really good company\".\n\n\"They're limited by whatever semiconductor processing technology they have, but they'll still be able to build very large systems by aggregating many of those chips together,\" Huang said.\n\nAmid the increased focus on generative AI in the past year and tighter US sanctions, Huawei and SMIC have allocated more capacity to AI chips, according to a Reuters report last month.\n\nOne GPU distributor, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that the Ascend 910B is \"available for order, but supply is really tight at the moment\".\n\nA server used for AI training and embedded with eight Ascend 910B cards costs around 1.5 million yuan (US$208,395), which is roughly in the same range as A100 server prices quoted in black market channels, according to a separate person familiar with the matter who also declined to be named.\n\nHuawei has not made any comment on the Ascend 910B, despite reiterating that AI is a \"key strategy\" ahead of the firm's exhibition at the four-day trade show MWC Barcelona in Spain last week.\n\nMany analysts and industry professionals are reluctant to comment on the Nvidia and Huawei showdown, although they pointed out that the US chip designer has depth in GPUs and benefits from its software ecosystem CUDA, a computing platform that allows developers to unleash the full potential of semiconductors.\n\n\"CUDA is sticky, Nvidia did all of this hard work on its own and is reaping the benefits,\" said Brian Colello, technology equity strategist at Morningstar. \"Huawei and its software partners will need to build out an ecosystem comparable [to Nvidia's CUDA] when it comes to tools to build AI models.\"\n\nDespite lagging CUDA's 2 million-strong list of registered developers, Huawei has its proprietary Compute Architecture for Neural Networks, a platform that connects Ascend hardware and software, crucial to unlocking AI computing power.\n\nColello said Huawei might have to make similar [big] investments in mainland China to strengthen its software capabilities. He added that perhaps other companies will work on the software libraries, while Huawei focuses on chip design.\n\n\"Huawei's strength is not in the software stack,\" said one Shanghai-based tech investor who requested anonymity. \"The US sanctions put limits on chip performance and production yields.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have soared big time since the beginning of 2023, clocking astronomic gains of 441% as the stock market has handsomely rewarded the company's outstanding top- and bottom-line growth, but that tremendous rally has made the stock extremely expensive.\n\nNvidia stock is currently trading at 41 times sales, significantly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 17.7. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index has an average price-to-sales ratio of 2.7. Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is also quite expensive at 97. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index, of which Nvidia is a part, has an average P/E ratio of 34.\n\nThese valuation multiples indicate that Nvidia isn't exactly a value pick right now. However, that's half the story, as a closer look at Nvidia's forward multiples and its potential growth prospects suggests something else.\n\nThink Nvidia stock is expensive? Think again\n\nWhile Nvidia does seem expensive as far as its trailing multiples are concerned, the picture changes completely when it comes to the company's forward-looking multiples. The stock sports a forward P/E multiple of 33. That's almost in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 30, using the index as a proxy for tech stocks.\n\nGiven Nvidia's leading position in the market for chips used for training artificial intelligence (AI) models -- the driving force behind the company's outstanding performance in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024 -- it is easy to see why its forward earnings multiple is substantially lower. The chipmaker's revenue jumped an impressive 126% in fiscal 2024 (which ended on Jan. 28) to almost $61 billion. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings shot up to $12.96 per share from $3.34 per share in the previous year, almost quadrupling in value.\n\nWorth noting is that Nvidia's growth in the final two quarters of fiscal 2024 was majestic. In Q3, for instance, its revenue was up 206% year over year to $18 billion. That was followed by a 265% year-over-year increase in revenue in the previous quarter to $22.1 billion. The chipmaker anticipates its revenue in the ongoing quarter to come in at $24 billion at the midpoint, which would be a 234% year-over-year increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that's not where the good part ends, as analysts are anticipating Nvidia's revenue to increase significantly in the new fiscal year, and beyond. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart above indicates, Nvidia's revenue is expected to jump 2.5x in the next three fiscal years from fiscal 2024's reading. That's not surprising, considering the potential growth opportunity in the AI chip market and Nvidia's pole position in this space.\n\nNvidia management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that its data center revenue shot up a whopping 409% year over year to $18.4 billion and produced 83% of its total revenue thanks to robust demand for \"both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases, and regions.\"\n\nThe company also added that it is witnessing an improvement in the supply of its data center chips. But despite that, it sees demand for its next-generation AI chips to be stronger than supply. That's not surprising, as Nvidia reportedly controls more than 80% of the market for AI chips, and customers have been lining up to get their hands on its offerings for AI training and inference.\n\nMore importantly, the company is focused on maintaining its leadership position in this lucrative market with its upcoming H200 AI graphics processing unit (GPU). Nvidia will start the initial shipments of this processor in the next quarter and claims that it is already witnessing solid demand for this product.\n\nWith the AI chip market set to clock annual growth of almost 38% through the end of the decade, generating an annual revenue of $207 billion in 2030, Nvidia is all set to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity thanks to its aggressive product plan. As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's stock head higher in the future, especially considering the terrific earnings growth it is predicted to deliver.\n\nExpect Nvidia's stock to keep delivering solid gains\n\nNvidia delivered $12.96 per share in earnings in fiscal 2024. As the chart below tells us, analysts have significantly raised their earnings growth expectations. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nIf Nvidia does hit $34.21 per share in earnings in fiscal 2027, as seen in the chart, and maintains its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39.2 at that time, its stock price could increase to $1,341. That would be a 70% increase from current levels.\n\nGiven that Nvidia is trading at a lower forward earnings multiple at present, investors are getting a good deal on this AI stock right now, which they should consider grabbing with both hands, as its red-hot rally seems here to stay.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Time To Ditch Tech Stocks for Gold?",
        "content": "Via SchiffGold.com\n\nThis week Peter covers the highlights of the last few weeks of volatile trading, paying special attention to Nvidia, Wall Street’s favorite AI stock, and Newmont Corporation, a heavy hitter in the gold mining industry.\n\nBoth companies’ shares experienced dramatic price action, with NVDA gaining $260 billion in market cap and pulling the market up after an excellent earnings report. Newmont, on the other hand, saw shares fall 7% after a disappointing last quarter.\n\nPeter explains how monetary policy influences the profitability of mining:\n\n“Part of the big problem for Newmont and all the other mining stocks is that it’s so much more expensive to mine gold now … Now why is that? Inflation. Inflation is taking a huge toll on the profits of these companies because the price of gold has not risen as much as the cost of mining it. And that is again why I keep saying gold mining stocks are the ironic victims of inflation.”\n\nNvidia and the tech sector’s recent surge is reminiscent of the market in the late 1990s, right before the Dot-com bubble popped:\n\n“What’s really significant about today’s situation is that you’ve got 1999-2000 all over again in the stock market,but it’s more like 2008 in terms of the disaster that’s waiting around the corner. We didn’t have a financial crisis in 2001. That didn’t happen until 2008.”\n\n[ZH: Or 1930s...]\n\nRelated: Could This Unknown Company Help Solve Europe’s Energy Crisis?\n\nThis doesn’t mean A.I. technology is doomed to fail. Rather, innovative companies like Nvidia are currently swept up in an overheating economy that will eventually give way to inflationary pressures:\n\n“There’s no doubt that artificial intelligence will be helpful… The markets once again are way ahead of the reality of where all of this is going, and at the same time, they’re overlooking the tremendous economic problems and financial problems that are hiding in plain sight.“\n\nStory continues\n\n[ZH: It's different this time...]\n\nPeter also discusses the FOMC minutes that were released this week, which showed Fed officials are still hesitant about cutting interest rates. Gold responded well to this news, as it did last week after higher-than-expected CPI figures were released:\n\n“The gold market kinda shrugged it off, which really shows you the underlying strength in the market. There was a brief sell-off in stocks, but I think investors quickly realized that look, … we’re going to get these cuts… What the markets are focused on is that the hikes are over… We’ve got the wind at our back. The question is… how strong is that wind?”\n\nRecent moves in the price of oil, mortgage rates, and treasury yields suggest these investors are overly optimistic:\n\n“These market indicators are showing that inflation is coming back, that we’ve bottomed out, and we’re just moving higher. And the markets do not expect that this is possible… If they’re wrong, the stock market is going to collapse.”\n\nRelated: This Could Be A Gamechanger For Natural Gas In Europe\n\nMarkets are expecting rates to fall this spring, but they need to rise:\n\n“If the Fed doesn’t hike rates, it could be even worse— maybe not for the market, but for the dollar, for bonds, and even more bullish for gold… If the Fed doesn’t hike rates, then inflation is just going to run out of control. And in fact, even if the Fed doesn’t cut rates— if it leaves rates where they are— real rates are going down because inflation is going to go up!”\n\nAdvocates of rate hikes are wrong when they assert that recent rate hikes constitute “restrictive monetary policy:”\n\n“This is not restrictive monetary policy. Again, less loose doesn’t qualify as tight… What is being restricted? Is the government being restricted? Is there any cutback in government spending? Is the government borrowing less because the Fed has increased the cost of borrowing money? No! The government is borrowing more! In fact, they’re borrowing more to pay the higher interest rates.”\n\nPeter wraps up by discussing a hefty fine leveled against Donald Trump in a New York fraud case. In this case and others, a politicized legal system portends a riskier and increasingly unattractive business environment, both in New York and in the rest of the country:\n\n“One of the reasons that a lot of international money has invested in America over the years is the confidence in our legal system, in the rule of law, in private property— that you can own property, assets, and business here, and you’re protected by the rule of law. It just can’t be arbitrarily taken from you, but what we’re now showing the world is that’s not the case!“\n\nWhile Wall Street celebrates a record week, Peter’s insights are less optimistic. It is unlikely a handful of tech stocks can perpetually sustain an economy burdened by years of inflation and oppressive government debt. America is addicted to cheap credit, and this addiction will cripple the economy if left unchecked.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nEU Mulls Extending Steel Safeguard Measures Amid Flood of Imports Is This the Death of the American Penny?

        "content": "In an Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) research note published on Wednesday, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth maintained the firm's \"buy\" rating on the market-leading artificial intelligence (AI) company. More strikingly, he increased his one-year price target on the stock from $790 per share to $985.\n\nIn his coverage, Feinseth stated that Nvidia looks poised to retain dominance in advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerated processing technologies that are powering data centers and the AI revolution. In addition to powerful demand tailwinds in the data center segment, Tigress Financial also expects that Nvidia's gaming business will see strong growth as users continue to value higher levels of visual fidelity.\n\nWith Nvidia currently trading at roughly $777 per share, should investors follow Feinseth's recommendation and buy the red-hot AI stock?\n\nInvestors can still score big profits with Nvidia stock\n\nTigress Financial's new price target for Nvidia suggests it could climb an additional 27% in the near-term, even though the GPU leader has already more than tripled in the past year.\n\nBut there are good reasons to think it can continue to climb higher. As Feinseth stated in his recent note on the stock, AI is at a tipping point, and Nvidia is at the forefront of this incredible technological transformation. With AI poised to have major impacts across every industry imaginable, the semiconductor company could enjoy sustained tailwinds for its revenue and cash flow growth.\n\nAfter growing sales 265% year over year to close out fiscal 2024, Nvidia is guiding for revenue in its first quarter to grow about 234% to $24.0 billion. The company's hot streak isn't over yet.\n\nFor long-term investors seeking top AI plays, Nvidia stock remains a compelling buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "To those caught in the still-inflating \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stock bubble, it's a worthy endeavor to remember there are 493 other potential equities to invest in within the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\n\nIndustrials, healthcare, and more are there for the picking!\n\nAnd outside of the S&P 500, there could be great investing opportunities in private equity, Treasurys, and hey, maybe even classic cars, if that's your thing.\n\nPut it all together, and this is what's known as diversification— a tried-and-true wealth-building approach tested by millionaires and billionaires alike, life and business strategist Tony Robbins touted.\n\n\"I would just say maintain diversification. We all heard it a million times,\" Robbins told Yahoo Finance at its New York City headquarters (see video above).\n\nThe six-foot-six author, who recently released \"The Holy Grail of Investing,\" says it's a reminder served up by longtime friend and vaunted investor, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio. By diversifying, an investor can better reduce correlations between investments — and bring down the potential risk.\n\nKnown for his ultra-high-energy seminars, Robbins, who has a reported net worth of more than $600 million, warned against the AI hype bubble.\n\n\"I am concerned about it as well,\" Robbins said about investors' infatuation with Magnificent Seven names such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThe diversification reminder couldn't come at a better time as the Magnificent Seven trade has become hyper-correlated and is mostly moving in a singular direction — up and to the right.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven now makes up some 30% of the S&P 500's market cap, in part powered by a hearty reaction to AI chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report a week ago. Said market reaction has Wall Street analysts tripping over themselves to ratchet up profit forecasts, essentially feeding more upward momentum in the group's stock prices.\n\nStory continues Life and business strategist Tony Robbins (left) reminds investors that diversification is important in an interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi (right). (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nDuring the past three months, Magnificent Seven earnings estimates have been revised higher by a lofty 7%, with its margins going up by 86 basis points, said Goldman Sachs strategists.\n\nThe average Magnificent Seven stock is up 14% this year, according to Yahoo Finance calculations. Nvidia has led the way with a 60% advance, while Tesla (TSLA) has dropped 23%.\n\nOver the past year, two of the Magnificent Seven companies have seen triple-digit-percentage gains — Nvidia at 239% and Meta (META) at 184%. The S&P 500 is up a very respectable 29% during that time.\n\nSome on the Street are finally beginning to call a timeout on the Magnificent Seven, with reasonable explanations that a reasonable investor should ponder.\n\n\"Elevated expectations and concentrated positioning create a high bar for the Magnificent 7 to beat,\" strategists at JPMorgan Asset Management contended in a new client note. \"AI will be investable for the long-haul and its beneficiaries will include far more than chipmakers.\"\n\nThey added that a soft economic landing and declining interest rates later this year stand to \"bode well for a catch up\" by sectors and companies left behind in last year's rally.\n\nAn argument could be made that not every Magnificent Seven member delivered blowout fourth quarters and outlooks to justify their stock's near-record valuation. Tony Robbins quote\n\nApple's (AAPL) performance in China was weak. The March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), it missed estimates on ad revenue, the core of its business. Tesla's quarter and its Elon Musk-led earnings call were littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — in the near term — that all its AI efforts are going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street. Stripping out the announcement of its first-ever dividend, Meta's quarter was okay — but it also jacked up its 2024 capital expenditures a ton, which could weigh on margins and cash flow.\n\nThe quarters out of Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia have been universally seen as huge.\n\n\"I've done everything in my life by saying success leaves clues. Find the best in the world. Figure out exactly what they do, do the same thing, and your chances of success go up a hundredfold,\" Robbins said.\n\nThe best investors in the game stay diversified — and not by buying seven tech companies that, at times, compete for the same customers.\n\nGive it a thought.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "The tech industry has a long history of providing investors with reliable gains. Since 2019, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector has risen more than 135%, far exceeding the S&P 500's 82% growth.\n\nThe innovative nature of tech makes it an ever-expanding space where companies benefit from consistent demand for various hardware and software upgrades. So it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway has dedicated at least 45% of its portfolio to tech stocks. Meanwhile, Berkshire's portfolio posted a nearly 20% compound annual gain from 1965 to 2023 and is now worth $370 billion.\n\nIn 2023, a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) captivated Wall Street. Excitement over the budding market sent numerous tech stocks soaring, with growth unlikely to slow soon. The generative technology can potentially boost countless markets, from consumer products to cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, machine learning, and more.\n\nThe tech industry has made a lot of millionaires over the years but has plenty of room left to run, with the AI market on its own projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, hitting nearly $2 trillion.\n\nSo here are two top tech stocks that could make you a millionaire.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAs the home of brands including Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has become a tech behemoth. The company attracts billions of users to its offerings and has a long history of delivering consistent gains to its investors.\n\nOver the past five years, Alphabet's annual revenue climbed 90% to $307 billion, while operating income rose 135% to $84 billion. And in that period, its stock soared 146%.\n\nAlphabet built a lucrative digital advertising business, which has become its biggest growth catalyst. With more than 80% of the search-engine market and supremacy in online video sharing and smartphone operating systems, the tech company has almost endless opportunities for ad revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Alphabet's most recent quarter, the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue increased by more than 13% year over year, beating expectations by $1 billion. Ad revenue slightly missed expectations in the quarter. However, its AI-focused Google Cloud segment posted revenue growth of 26% to $9 billion. Meanwhile, Google Cloud's operating income reached $864 million, versus the $186 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period.\n\nThe company's gradual expansion into AI is promising, as it could boost multiple areas of its business. Alphabet could offer more efficient advertising, create a search experience closer to ChatGPT, expand its AI cloud services, and more.\n\nAlphabet is on an exciting growth path, with solid positions in multiple areas of tech. Meanwhile, its free cash flow hit $70 billion last year, indicating it has the funds to keep up with the completion and invest in its business.  AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, Alphabet is trading at a bargain to its competitors. This chart shows Alphabet has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio among some of the most prominent names in tech.\n\nAlongside a lucrative ad business, a growing role in AI, and a range of potent brands, Alphabet is a tech stock that could make you a millionaire over the long term and is worth considering this month.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has made a lot of millionaires over the last year, with its stock up 235% since February 2023. However, it appears to only just be getting started, suggesting it's not too late to see major gains from the chipmaker's stock.\n\nNvidia dominated the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for years, significantly ahead of rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The company's supremacy in the industry positioned it to immediately begin supplying its hardware to countless AI-minded companies right at the start of the AI boom last year.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's earnings skyrocketed since the start of 2023, thanks to a spike in chip sales. In Q4 2024, ended in January, the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily owed to a 409% increase in data center revenue as GPU demand soared.\n\nIn addition to increased earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion.\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both chipmakers, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead ChartData by YCharts\n\nThis chart shows Nvidia's earnings could hit $34 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E of 32 yields a stock price of $1,094.\n\nConsidering its current position, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 39% by fiscal 2027. In addition to a dominating position in a high-growth market like AI, Nvidia is a screaming buy this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO says AI could pass human tests in five years",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\nPALO ALTO, California - (Reuters) - Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Friday said that artificial general intelligence could - by some definitions - arrive in as little as five years.\n\nHuang, who heads the world's leading maker of artificial intelligence chips used to create systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, was responding to a question at an economic forum held at Stanford University about how long it would take to achieve one of Silicon Valley's long-held goals of creating computers that can think like humans.\n\nHuang said that the answer largely depends on how the goal is defined. If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said, artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive soon.\n\n\"If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one,\" said Huang, whose firm hit $2 trillion in market value on Friday.\n\nAs of now, AI can pass tests such as legal bar exams, but still struggles on specialized medial tests such as gastroenterology. But Huang said that in five years it should also be able to pass any of them.\n\nBut by other definitions, Huang said, AGI may be much further away, because scientists still disagree on how to describe how human minds work.\n\n\"Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer\" because engineers need defined goals, Huang said.\n\nHuang also addressed a question about how many more chip factories, called \"fabs\" in the industry, are needed to support the expansion of the AI industry. Media reports have said OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman thinks many more fabs are needed.\n\nHuang said that more will be needed, but each chip will also get better over time, which acts to limit the number of chips needed.\n\n\"We're going to need more fabs. However, remember that we're also improving the algorithms and the processing of (AI) tremendously over time,\" Huang said. \"It's not as if the efficiency of computing is what it is today, and therefore the demand is this much. I'm improving computing by a million times over 10 years.\"\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in Palo Alto, California; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "title": "Even After Rallying 239% in 1 Year, Nvidia Stock Still Isn't Expensive According to This Key Metric",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the talk of the town in 2023, and it continues to be a Wall Street darling in 2024. It's arguably the single most important stock behind the artificial intelligence trend currently fueling the market.\n\nAs Nvidia has climbed higher and the broad market also reaches new all-time highs, skeptics have sounded the alarm for a stock market bubble. And while the market is stretched thinner than in years past, there's still reason to believe Nvidia is not necessarily overvalued, despite its 439% gain since the beginning of 2023.\n\nRed hot growth\n\nSay what you want about Nvidia stock's epic rise, but the company is delivering on every measure with a one-two punch of high revenue growth and expanding margins. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nRevenue has more than tripled in the last year, while net income is up over 500%. That level of growth for a company as big as Nvidia is incredible.\n\nAn understandable valuation\n\nThe past year of gains has also pushed Nvidia to trade with a 66.2 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a steep premium to even its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. However, the average analyst estimate for Nvidia's fiscal 2025 earnings per share is $23.92, roughly double last year's result.\n\nThe surge in anticipated profits gives Nvidia a much more reasonable forward P/E ratio. In fact, Nvidia has a lower forward-looking valuation than Tesla, Amazon, and Microsoft. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nYou would be hard-pressed to find a growth stock that has nearly quadrupled in the last year with that low of a forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe pitfalls of cyclical stocks\n\nAt the same time, there are a few reasons why focusing only on forward P/E is dangerous for a company like Nvidia. First, Nvidia still has to double its profits in the current fiscal year -- a high bar for any company, let alone one this size. The even more significant risk to consider is that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\n\nTypically, cyclical stocks have low P/E ratios during an expansion and high P/E ratios during a downturn. The idea is that investors won't pay too high of a price during times of elevated earnings but also won't sell off a stock just because there's a contraction in the cycle. Over time, the median P/E ratio works itself out to something more reasonable.\n\nStory continues\n\nA good example is agriculture and construction giant Deere. The company's earnings are slowing as the current expansion period nears an end. However, Deere's P/E ratio is just 10.6 because its trailing earnings are high, but investor sentiment is negative (shares are down 14% in the past year). Its 10-year median P/E ratio is a much higher 17.1 -- which makes sense -- the long-term median should be higher than Deere's current valuation. But in a downturn, investors can expect Deere's P/E to climb higher than that long-term baseline.\n\nThe opposite is happening with Nvidia. Its 66.1 P/E is higher than its 46.7 10-year median. But again, you could argue Nvidia deserves a much higher valuation given its scorching hot growth rate and earnings outlook for this year.\n\nThe story is getting better, but it's still a story\n\nNvidia is exciting because it's growing quickly, and it's already such a valuable company that it can drive the whole market. Nvidia has already become a bit of a story stock, a company valued based more on its hype and potential than its fundamentals. But Nvidia isn't priced for perfection, either -- its 32.1 forward P/E ratio is reasonable, especially relative to the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. After all, Nvidia has almost always carried a premium, and there's no reason that should change in this part of its growth journey.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to buy Nvidia when the expectations are lower, and there's more margin for error. Nvidia's short-term performance could take a turn for the worse due to macroeconomic conditions and factors outside its control. And with the stock sitting at its peak, there's a heavy expectation its growth will march on uninterrupted. A forward P/E ratio above 30 is acceptable for a company likely to double its earnings this year, but that will change quickly if the company fails to deliver.\n\nProspective investors should be cautious about those expectations, as well as the behavior patterns of cyclical stocks. The easy money has already been made, and with Nvidia's market cap reaching $2 trillion, expecting the stock to again triple in the near term isn't realistic.\n\nAs an individual investor considering Nvidia for your portfolio, it's up to you to decide what kind of price you're willing to pay for the stock and what you expect from the business at that price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Has Created Millionaires and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded last year and has shown no signs of slowing. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reinvigorated interest in AI and caused countless tech companies to restructure their businesses with an emphasis on the budding industry.\n\nIncreased demand for AI services boosted graphics processing unit (GPU) sales accordingly, as the chips are crucial for training AI models. As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has massively profited from increased demand for GPUs, getting a head start in the industry and snapping up a majority market share in AI chips in 2023.\n\nThe chipmaker's earnings skyrocketed over the last year, with its stock delivering triple-digit growth since last February. Meanwhile, GPU demand looks unlikely to dissipate any time soon, as the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. Consequently, Nvidia remains one of the best ways to invest in the high-growth sector.\n\nSo, here is one AI stock that has created millionaires and will likely continue to make more.\n\nNvidia has enjoyed stellar growth over the last year\n\nNvidia dominated the GPU market for years, significantly ahead of rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The company's supremacy in the industry positioned it to immediately begin supplying its hardware to countless AI-minded companies right at the start of the AI boom last year.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's stock is up 240% year over year, which has come alongside soaring earnings. In its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024 ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data-center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\n\nIn addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\nIts dominance in AI has staying power\n\nNvidia achieved an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs last year. The company's massive success in the industry motivated several tech companies to venture in as well. In 2024, AMD and Intel began shipping new AI GPUs designed to challenge Nvidia's offerings. However, chip-market trends indicate Nvidia's supremacy will be difficult for challengers to overcome.\n\nDespite AMD and Intel's presence in the sector, Nvidia has held an over-80% market share in desktop GPUs for years. Intel only entered the industry last year, while AMD's history in desktop GPUs spans decades. Still, AMD's GPUs only account for about 10% of the market.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the central processing unit (CPU) industry. Intel was king of CPUs for years, with an 82% market share at the start of 2017 when AMD landed on the scene with its Ryzen line of CPUs.\n\nAMD managed to steal a significant share from Intel. However, Intel is still responsible for most of the CPU market, with its share above 60% and AMD's at 36%.\n\nUsing the CPU market as a base of comparison, Nvidia could lose some AI GPU share to its competitors over the next year. However, it is unlikely to lose its leading position, allowing it to see major gains from AI for years.\n\nTrading at its best value in 12 months NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios plunged in the last year (as seen in the chart above), indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months.\n\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, the P/FCF ratio divides its market cap by free cash flow. These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. Nvidia's declining figures could make now the best time to consider adding its stock to your portfolio.\n\nAlong with a powerful position in AI and stellar financial growth, Nvidia is on a path to continue making millionaires, and you won't want to miss out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune",
        "content": "\"Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.\" -- Warren Buffett, from the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders\n\nOne big winner can make a fortune. No one knows this better than the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nTake Apple, one of Buffett's most famous investments. A $50,000 investment, made in 2007 -- the same year the iPhone debuted -- would have grown to a cool $3.5 million today, a mere 17 years later.\n\nAre there any stocks out there today with that type of potential? Of course. Here are three that might have what it takes. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nTopping the list is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The company that made former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer some of the richest men in the world is once again the largest company on the face of the Earth with a market cap topping $3 trillion. And thanks to its many artificial intelligence (AI)-related ventures, Microsoft stands an excellent chance of creating many more fortunes.\n\nLet's start with the company's cloud services business. It's already a massive moneymaker for Microsoft, generating $25.9 billion in its most recent quarter (the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023). That makes it the second-largest cloud services vendor globally, trailing only Amazon Web Services.\n\nAs AI usage ramps up, Microsoft stands to benefit from increased cloud services. Indeed, after decelerating some in 2022, cloud spending appears to be reaccelerating as organizations explore how AI can improve their processes and generate efficiencies.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft's longstanding partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, makes Microsoft a major player in the race to develop the next AI breakthrough.\n\nFinally, Microsoft's often underrated search, news, and advertising segment is gaining market share and growing at close to double-digits, thanks in part to its ChatGPT-powered features, which were added last year.\n\nMicrosoft has multiple pathways to riches on the AI front. Given its outstanding track record and excellent management, Microsoft could be one AI stock that makes many fortunes going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nNext is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). While nowhere near the size of Microsoft, CrowdStrike is still likely to make a number of fortunes in the coming years, thanks to its cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity offerings.\n\nThe company runs perhaps the premier cybersecurity platform available today, which protects networks, endpoints, and data through add-on modules that are tailored to its customers' needs. Its modules are scalable and designed to increase in effectiveness as their data inputs grow larger. In other words, CrowdStrike's product becomes better the longer a customer uses and feeds more data to its AI.\n\nWhat's more, this network effect isn't limited to just one customer. As more organizations adopt CrowdStrike's platform, its AI is able to draw on more scenarios and interactions that help the system detect and prevent unwanted activity across its entire protection umbrella -- similar to the way local law enforcement agencies can rely on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list to be on the lookout for specific individuals they themselves may have never encountered.\n\nFinancially, CrowdStrike is rocking and rolling. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended Oct. 31, 2023), the company reported $786 million in revenue, up 35% from a year earlier. Moreover, annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- a closely watched metric for companies selling subscription-based products -- increased to $3.15 billion, with $223 million of net new ARR added in the quarter.\n\nIn short, this means CrowdStrike is growing its subscription base, through bringing in new customers and by upselling additional security modules to existing customers.\n\nAt any rate, the company's solid growth points to big things ahead, as the number of cyber threats continues to grow -- meaning CrowdStrike's growth curve could extend for many years to come.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nLast, but by no means least, is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's face it: No company or stock has ridden the AI wave better or to greater heights than Nvidia. The company is now America's third-largest public company with a market cap hovering near $2 trillion -- up from $279 billion fewer than 18 months ago.\n\nImprobable as it may seem, it's entirely possible that Nvidia could continue its ascent -- even passing Apple and Microsoft to become the largest company globally.\n\nThat's because its rate of growth is truly eye-popping. Revenue grew 265% as of its most recent quarter (the three months ended Jan. 28). Moreover, estimates of future growth are sky-high. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nUltimately, no one really knows how large the AI chip market could get. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently said it could grow to $400 billion. Perhaps it could be even more.\n\nAt any rate, it's clear Nvidia has a massive head start over its competitors, and thanks to competitive advantages like its CUDA software, it might maintain those advantages for some time to come. That makes Nvidia, a company that has already made many fortunes, a prime candidate to make countless more in the years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Making a Lot of Money Selling Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chips, but You May Be Surprised About How Much It Could Make From This Traditional Market",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's stunning rally since the beginning of 2023 was primarily driven by the rapid growth of the company's data center business, which benefited from the booming demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards.\n\nIn the company's recently concluded fiscal year 2024 (which ended on Jan. 28), the data center business produced a record $47.5 billion in revenue, accounting for 79% of its top line. That was a massive increase of 217% from the year-ago period.\n\nThe data center business recorded a much stronger year-over-year increase of 409% in revenue to $18.4 billion in fiscal Q4, significantly outpacing the segment's annual growth.\n\nThis suggests Nvidia's data center business is still gaining momentum, which also explains why the company's outlook for the current quarter was well ahead of consensus estimates. Nvidia expects revenue of $24 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which would be a 233% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nGiven that Nvidia relies on sales of chips that are being deployed in data centers for AI training and inference purposes, it can be easily concluded that this business segment can continue to be a major catalyst for the company.\n\nHowever, investors shouldn't ignore the progress Nvidia is making in its second-largest business segment -- which was originally the company's bread and butter before AI arrived -- as it has the potential to supercharge the company's already impressive growth.\n\nNvidia's gaming business is set to jump significantly thanks to AI\n\nNvidia brought major innovation to personal computers (PCs) in 1999 when it introduced what it calls the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU), an additional processor tacked on to a PC's motherboard for running graphics-intensive workloads such as video games.\n\nNvidia's GPU technology evolved over the years, and it is now being used in multiple industries ranging from automotive to digital twins to AI. But at the same time, the company continues to be a major player in the market for discrete PC graphics cards with a share of more than 80%. The good part is that this dominance is leading to robust financial gains for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company generated $10.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 from the gaming segment, an increase of 15% from the prior-year period. That's a nice recovery considering that the gaming GPU market was not in great shape a year ago on account of poor PC sales and oversupply. However, Nvidia's 56% year-over-year increase in gaming revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 suggests that this market gained tremendous momentum.\n\nOne of the reasons why that's happening is because of the recovery in the PC market. Market research firm Canalys estimates that PC sales could increase by 8% in 2024 following last year's drop of 12.4%. AI is going to play a key role in this growth. According to IDC, AI-enabled PCs capable of running generative AI applications locally could gain solid traction from 2024 with shipments of 50 million units.\n\nIDC predicts that annual shipments of such AI-enabled PCs could climb to an impressive 167 million units in 2027. Even then, this emerging niche will have a lot of room for growth as AI PCs are expected to account for 60% of overall PC shipments in 2027. For Nvidia, the adoption of AI PCs will unlock a massive growth opportunity, and the good part is that the company has already started capitalizing on this nascent market.\n\nIn its latest earnings release, Nvidia said that it enabled generative AI capabilities for an installed base of 100 million users who are using the RTX series of graphics cards.\n\nMoreover, the company released new RTX 40 Super series graphics cards starting at $599 in January, which come equipped with generative AI capabilities. In a presentation in October 2023, Nvidia pointed out that 47% of its installed base of discrete GPU users were using RTX graphics cards. Meanwhile, only 20% of the installed base is using a graphics card more powerful than an RTX 3060, a chip that's now more than three years old.\n\nSo, a big chunk of Nvidia's user base can be expected to upgrade to its new, AI-capable GPUs as generative AI adoption gains steam. At the same time, the increase in the adoption of AI-enabled PCs suggests that there is a huge addressable opportunity for Nvidia to tap into.\n\nNvidia could make a lot of money in AI PCs\n\nAnnual shipments of AI-powered PCs could hit 167 million units in 2027, as per IDC. The researcher also points out that these PCs will be equipped with dedicated chips to run generative AI workloads. Nvidia's latest RTX 40 series GPUs come  with Tensor Cores to enable AI workloads. These Tensor Cores offer between 242 and 1,321 tera operations per second (TOPS) of performance.\n\nThis puts Nvidia's RTX 40 series GPUs in the category of advanced AI chips, IDC said. It said   AI PCs equipped with a dedicated chip that offers more than 60 TOPS of performance are categorized as advanced AI PCs.\n\nNvidia controls 80% of the AI GPU market. If the company can maintain that share in 2027, it could sell a whopping 133 million AI GPUs for PCs that year. If Nvidia can maintain an average selling price of even $400 per AI GPU, which is significantly lower than the $599 starting price for the RTX 40 Super Series, it can generate a whopping $53 billion in annual gaming revenue in 2027.\n\nThat would be more than 5 times Nvidia's gaming revenue in the latest fiscal year, suggesting that the company could still enjoy solid growth in a market that propelled it into the limelight years ago and was its bread and butter for a long time. Throw in the potential growth the company could witness in the data center business over the next five years, and it won't be surprising to see it sustain its red-hot stock market rally in the long run.\n\nThat's why investors would do well to buy this semiconductor stock while it is available at an attractive 33 times forward earnings, which is almost in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple of 31.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

There’s no single definition of a market bubble, but for me it has to involve a speculative mania.

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis\n\nPALO ALTO, California - (Reuters) - Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Friday said that artificial general intelligence could - by some definitions - arrive in as little as five years.\n\nHuang, who heads the world's leading maker of artificial intelligence chips used to create systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, was responding to a question at an economic forum held at Stanford University about how long it would take to achieve one of Silicon Valley's long-held goals of creating computers that can think like humans.\n\nHuang said that the answer largely depends on how the goal is defined. If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said, artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive soon.\n\n\"If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one,\" said Huang, whose firm hit $2 trillion in market value on Friday.\n\nAs of now, AI can pass tests such as legal bar exams, but still struggles on specialized medial tests such as gastroenterology. But Huang said that in five years it should also be able to pass any of them.\n\nBut by other definitions, Huang said, AGI may be much further away, because scientists still disagree on how to describe how human minds work.\n\n\"Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer\" because engineers need defined goals, Huang said.\n\nHuang also addressed a question about how many more chip factories, called \"fabs\" in the industry, are needed to support the expansion of the AI industry. Media reports have said OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman thinks many more fabs are needed.\n\nHuang said that more will be needed, but each chip will also get better over time, which acts to limit the number of chips needed.\n\n\"We're going to need more fabs. However, remember that we're also improving the algorithms and the processing of (AI) tremendously over time,\" Huang said. \"It's not as if the efficiency of computing is what it is today, and therefore the demand is this much. I'm improving computing by a million times over 10 years.\"\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in Palo Alto, California; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "title": "2 Small AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) and accelerated computing bull market continues to build a head of steam. Investors can't get enough of leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) that are crafting next-generation computing systems.\n\nBut for some investors, the price tags on stocks like Nvidia may have gotten too high to stomach. That's OK. There are some far smaller AI-related businesses trading at relatively attractive valuations that might suit long-term investors. Two such small AI stocks worth a look at right now are Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS) and Silicon Motion (NASDAQ: SIMO).\n\n1. Axcelis: New AI chips need efficient power and new manufacturing techniques\n\nAxcelis Technologies is a small semiconductor manufacturing equipment provider that competes primarily with industry giant Applied Materials. Its specialty is ion implant machines, which are used to introduce non-silicon material into chips to alter and enhance the electrical conductivity properties of the devices ultimately being made.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) industry provided a strong tailwind for Axcelis' revenue and profit growth in the last few years, but Axcelis is experiencing what management believes will be a temporary growth pause in 2024 as EV adoption moderates. It is guiding for sales of equipment to decline in the first half of the year before rallying in the second half. ACLS Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nHowever, the company is developing new use cases for its ion implant machines, including in the manufacture of the advanced logic chips used in applications like AI. Axcelis thinks that market will propel it to higher growth rates for years to come. Management is targeting about $1.3 billion in sales in 2025, up by a mid-teens percentage from its top line in 2023.\n\nShares are well below the high-water mark they touched last year, and are starting to look like a serious value. For a company with $506 million in cash and equivalents on its books, no debt, and ample growth outlets, a 1-year-forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 13 looks like a good buy to me. I recently started buying shares of Axcelis after watching the company from the sidelines for a couple of years.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Silicon Motion: AI needs new memory technology, too\n\nSilicon Motion (NASDAQ: SIMO) designs memory controllers -- a type of chip that governs the flow of data into and out of memory in devices like PCs and smartphones. It's the market leader in that niche, but the small semiconductor company has ample competition, including from some of its customers.\n\nYou see, leading memory chip manufacturers like Micron Technology and Samsung also design some of their own memory controllers in an attempt to control costs.\n\nHowever, Silicon Motion's edge is designing high-performance offerings, and because of that, device manufacturers and their memory chip suppliers tend to select Silicon Motion's wares over prepackaged memory controllers that may lack the extra oomph needed.\n\nThe strategy has resulted in a business that generates lumpy results. But as PC and smartphone makers gear up to provide support for on-device AI in the years ahead, high-performance controllers could be in high demand. Silicon Motion has been rebuilding its momentum after a two-year slump in the PC and smartphone industry. To be sure, PC and smartphone sales appear to be stabilizing, but a true growth cycle hasn't been unleashed just yet. However, management expects Silicon Motion's growth to outpace the growth of the consumer electronics market in 2024 with 20% to 25% revenue expansion.\n\nWhat drew my attention to Silicon Motion a while back was that it (much like Axcelis) is a small business with adequate cash reserves ($314 million to be exact, and no debt) and an attractive valuation. Shares trade at a 1-year-forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 15.\n\nBecause both of these small businesses have big competitors, there's a risk of them getting steamrolled. Such is life for the typical small-cap stock. However, in a new era of AI-powered computing, these two value stocks look worthy of inclusion in my portfolio of about two dozen small businesses with potentially big upsides. Time will tell, but strong lineups of products and key tech that will contribute to the AI computing revolution bode well for Axcelis Technologies and Silicon Motion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Axcelis Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Axcelis Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Axcelis Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Rival Advanced Micro Devices shares gained 5.25% to a record high close of $202.64, while the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index also closed at a record after a jump of 4.29% on the session.\n\nMarkets have drawn support from a resilient economy, as investors have tried to gauge the timing of the first interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, with investors currently targeting June and growing expectations the central bank can engineer a soft landing for the economy.\n\n\"Because the economy is doing well and because inflation remains a bit sticky, the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.\n\n\"But that's good because then we're gradually coming off of the higher interest rate cycle and we're not in need of cutting rates aggressively.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.99 points, or 0.23% , to 39,087.38, the S&P 500 gained 40.81 points, or 0.80%, to 5,137.08 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 183.02 points, or 1.14%, to 16,274.94.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 gained 0.95%, the Nasdaq rose 1.74%, and the Dow fell 0.11%.\n\nDespite a strong services sector and tight labor market, the economy still shows pockets of weakness, notably in manufacturing, although\n\ndata on Friday\n\nincluded some signs of a possible rebound.\n\nThat helped push U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the two-year note yield falling to as low as 4.519%.\n\nFed Governor Chris Waller said upcoming decisions about the ultimate size of its balance sheet have no bearing on its inflation fight.\n\nFellow Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said she is\n\ncautiously optimistic\n\nprogress will continue on disinflation without a significant weakening of the labor market, and that the central bank has avoided a wage-price spiral. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said it is too soon to predict when the Fed will be able to begin cutting rates.\n\nThe S&P 500 tech index was the top performer of the 11 major sectors, gaining 1.78%, while utilities were weakest, showing a decline of 0.72%.\n\nAmong major movers, New York Community Bancorp tumbled 25.89% after the regional lender said it had found \"material weaknesses\" in internal controls related to its loan review and revised its fourth-quarter loss to 10 times above the previously stated numbers, which helped send the KBW regional banking index 1.27% lower.\n\nDell Technologies surged 31.62%, its biggest daily percentage gain ever, after the personal computer maker forecast annual revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates.\n\nGains on the Dow were curbed in part by a 1.83% fall in Boeing after a report said the planemaker was in talks to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.29-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.55-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 87 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 363 new highs and 88 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak Editing by Chris Reese and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "*\n\nNvidia crosses $2 trillion in market cap\n\n*\n\nDell forecasts upbeat fiscal 2025 on AI server demand\n\n*\n\nNYCB plunges after loan review disclosure\n\n*\n\nIndexes up: Dow 0.23%, S&P 500 0.80%, Nasdaq 1.14%\n\n(Updated at 4:08 p.m. ET/ 2108 GMT)\n\nBy Chuck Mikolajczak\n\nNEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) -\n\nU.S. stocks rose on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing at record highs, as technology stocks rallied on continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, with further support from declining Treasury yields.\n\nThe gains marked the second straight closing record for the Nasdaq, which also set an intraday record as AI-related names such as Nvidia and Meta Platforms led it past its prior peak of 16,212.23 set in November 2021.\n\nThrough the end of February, the three major indexes notched their fourth straight month of gains in a rally largely fueled by growth prospects related to AI, which has also lifted semiconductor names.\n\nOn Friday, shares of Nvidia climbed 4% and closed above $2 trillion in market value for the first time. Rival Advanced Micro Devices shares gained 5.25% to a record high close of $202.64, while the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index also closed at a record after a jump of 4.29% on the session.\n\nMarkets have drawn support from a resilient economy, as investors have tried to gauge the timing of the first interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, with investors currently targeting June and growing expectations the central bank can engineer a soft landing for the economy.\n\n\"Because the economy is doing well and because inflation remains a bit sticky, the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.\n\n\"But that's good because then we're gradually coming off of the higher interest rate cycle and we're not in need of cutting rates aggressively.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.99 points, or 0.23% , to 39,087.38, the S&P 500 gained 40.81 points, or 0.80%, to 5,137.08 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 183.02 points, or 1.14%, to 16,274.94.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite a strong services sector and tight labor market, the economy still shows pockets of weakness, notably in manufacturing, although\n\ndata on Friday\n\nincluded some signs of a possible rebound.\n\nThat helped push U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the two-year note yield falling to as low as 4.519%.\n\nFed Governor Chris Waller said upcoming decisions about the ultimate size of its balance sheet have no bearing on its inflation fight.\n\nFellow Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said she is\n\ncautiously optimistic\n\nprogress will continue on disinflation without a significant weakening of the labor market, and that the central bank has avoided a wage-price spiral. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said it is too soon to predict when the Fed will be able to begin cutting rates.\n\nThe S&P 500 tech index was the top performer of the 11 major sectors, gaining 1.78%, while utilities were weakest, showing a decline of 0.72%.\n\nAmong major movers, New York Community Bancorp tumbled 25.89% after the regional lender said it had found \"material weaknesses\" in internal controls related to its loan review and revised its fourth-quarter loss to 10 times above the previously stated numbers, which helped send the KBW regional banking index 1.27% lower.\n\nDell Technologies surged 31.62%, its biggest daily percentage gain ever, after the personal computer maker forecast annual revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates.\n\nGains on the Dow were curbed in part by a 1.83% fall in Boeing after a report said the planemaker was in talks to buy supplier Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.29-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.55-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 87 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 363 new highs and 88 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak Editing by Chris Reese and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia's stock market value was on track to close above $2 trillion for the first time on Friday after an upbeat report from Dell Technologies reignited Wall Street's AI-fueled rally.\n\nNvidia's stock added 3.5% after Dell, which sells high-end servers made with Nvidia's processors, gave an upbeat forecast late on Thursday, pointing to a surge in orders for its AI-optimized servers.\n\nDell's shares soared as much as 38% to a record high. They were last up 30%.\n\nFriday's gains put Nvidia's market capitalization at $2.05 trillion, making it Wall Street's third most valuable company behind Microsoft and Apple at $3.07 trillion and $2.75 trillion, respectively.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, another company that sells servers made with Nvidia's chips, jumped 6%.\n\nOther chipmakers exposed to AI rallied to record highs, with Broadcom and Marvell Technology each up about 8%, while Advanced Micro Devices climbed nearly 5%.\n\nThe PHLX chip index rallied 4.5% to its own record high, lifting its 2024 gain to 18%.\n\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, with customers including ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms snapping up tight supplies of its components to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.\n\nThe company has recently become Wall Street's most traded stock by value, day to day, replacing Tesla. Investors exchanged $36 billion worth of Nvidia's stock on average over the past 30 sessions, compared to $21 billion a day for Tesla.\n\nTrading in Nvidia on Friday afternoon reached $28 billion worth of shares.\n\nOn Feb. 23, the Santa Clara, California-based company added $277 billion in stock market value in just one session, a Wall Street record, after it forecast a roughly threefold surge in quarterly revenue.\n\nNvidia's stock has now risen 65% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. Last month, its stock market value overtook Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nA week ago, Nvidia's stock market value edged above $2 trillion for the first time before receding by the end of the session.\n\nSaudi Aramco has a $2.045 trillion market capitalization, although over 90% of it is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors, according to LSEG data.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Just Bought These 3 Biotech Stocks. Should You Buy, Too?",
        "content": "The U.S. spends approximately $450 billion every year treating rare diseases. Investing guru Cathie Wood says managing patients afflicted with these illnesses could cost $20 trillion over their lifetime. Curing these diseases would be invaluable.\n\nThe likelihood of that happening is something one can only dream of today. Yet based on research from Wood’s Ark Invest, the companies pursuing these treatments could see their enterprise value race higher by a 28% compounded annual growth rate. That means by the end of the decade their value would grow from $820 billion to $4.5 trillion!\n\nThat could be why she is investing in the stocks of the biotechs utilizing CRISPR gene editing, RNA therapeutics and targeted protein degradation. Below are three top Cathie Wood biotech stocks to consider for your own portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n10X Genomics (TXG) 10x Genomics headquarters campus in Silicon Valley. TXG Stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\n10X Genomics (NASDAQ:TXG) isn’t pursuing life-changing drug development itself but instead provides the tools researchers need to achieve their goals. The life sciences technology stock is quickly becoming a favorite of Wood. She sharply increased her stake in TXG stock last October and has been steadily buying more ever since.\n\nParticularly after its earnings report two weeks ago, which disappointed the market, Wood was in there buying. The stock is down 16% since earnings but only 2% lower over the past year. She clearly believes in its equipment for single-cell and spatial biology, which it says helps researchers “understand biological systems at a resolution and scale that matches the complexity of biology.” Essentially its machines test and analyze DNA that allow researchers to study individual cells and their genetic information.\n\nRevenue jumped 18% in the fourth quarter to $184 million but gross margins narrowed to 66% and operating losses more than doubled to $55 million. Guidance wasn’t any better as it forecast full-year 2024 revenue growth of 10% at the midpoint. That’s half the growth that it saw last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet this cutting-edge instrument maker offers the potential for substantial gains due to the sale of software and consumables that make up 76% of total revenue. As customers come back for more as it sells new, more complex equipment, 10X Genomics could gain traction and take off.\n\nPrime Medicine (PRME) An image of a scientist holding forceps, taking a piece of a DNA helix\n\nSource: Panuwach/Shutterstock\n\nWood has been a buyer of Prime Medicine (NASDAQ:PRME) since its Oct. 2022 initial public offering. Two weeks ago, though, her holdings of this pre-clinical gene editing company rocketed from 2.6 million shares to over 6 million shares. This followed Prime pricing a new stock offering at $6.25 per share. The stock has been the opposite of 10X Genomics. Shares are up just 3% in 2024 but down 48% over the past year.\n\nPrime Medicine is developing a more versatile form of gene editing called prime editing. It is seen as a more precise, safer upgrade to CRISPR gene editing. Recently, researchers led by Prime’s founder David Liu, used a prime editor to partially restore vision in blind mice. Where CRISPR editing cuts, removes and replaces genes, prime editing is more akin to swapping out DNA sequences without breaking the DNA strands. The technique was previously used by Prime to correct liver disease in primates.\n\nThis is the sort of technology Wood believes can change the world and is likely why she is investing so heavily in PRME stock.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) is using artificial intelligence (AI) to discover new drugs. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) invested $50 million in the biotech last summer through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing deal. It also allows Recursion access to its AI tools to assist in drug discovery.\n\nLast month Nvidia also announced Recursion would be the first third-party biotech participating on its new generative AI BioNeMo platform for drug development.\n\nRXRX stock got a huge boost from the earlier partnership but the stock continues climbing. Shares are up 37% year to date and 67% over the last 12 months. Wood began investing heavily in Recursion before the Nvidia deal, but started ramping up her purchases afterward. Her holdings went from around 7 million shares in November to over 22 million shares today.\n\nAI potentially makes the long, arduous drug discovery process quicker and less expensive. Recursion delivered a bit of a dud in the earnings department the other day, though, causing RXRX stock to crumble 17%. The biotech generated less than $11 million in fourth-quarter revenue, almost half of what Wall Street was expecting, though net losses were slightly narrower than forecast.\n\nWith backing from major global pharmaceuticals like Bayer (OTCMKTS:BAYRY), Recursion Pharmaceuticals seems like a good bet to recover and move higher once more.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI's Winning Duos: BBAI &amp; PLTR, SOUN &amp; NVDA",
        "content": "By now, the AI revolution is no secret to Wall Street. However, two under-the-radar, pure play AI stocks offer asymmetric reward-to-risk. In addition, these two up-and-comers have recently inked deals with AI juggernauts, offering a massive catalyst. Below are the two highest-impact AI partnerships:\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI) & Palantir (PLTR)\n\nBigBear.ai and Palantir both offer decision intelligence solutions spanning national security, digital identity, supply chains and logistics, enterprise operations, and integration of manned-unmanned teaming within autonomous systems. On February 28th, BBAI and PLTR announced a strategic partnership combining AI-powered products with a next-generation operating platform. The partnership is a big deal for BBAI for two reasons:\n\n1.)    BBAI has a market cap of just $600 million, while PLTR has a market cap of $54 billion. With PLTR as a partner, BBAI has an opportunity to throw gasoline on their growth.\n\n2.)    PLTR is the undisputed leader in this niche space. If PLTR finds value in BBAI’s offering, it proves the quality of BBAI’s product suite. Also, PLTR may look to acquire the company down the line, should it be necessary.\n\nSwing to Profitably\n\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) have proven how much demand there is for the AI industry. However, few pure plays exist, and even fewer profitable ones. Last quarter, BBAI posted its first profitable quarter as a public company. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWall Street is Bullish\n\nZacks Consensus Estimates suggest healthy EPS growth of 64.21% in 20223. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBBAI is also gaining momentum from an EPS expectations perspective. Last quarter, BBAI beat analysts’ expectations by 142.86%.\n\nAccumulation Patterns\n\nOn February 27, shares jumped 38% on volume 10x the norm! The news was not apparent, but such heavy volume and price momentum indicate massive accumulation. The stock also forms a bullish and potentially explosive high-tight flag pattern.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) & Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nSOUN Overview\n\nSoundHound is a technology company that specializes in audio and voice recognition. One of its prominent products is the SoundHound app, which allows users to identify songs by listening to a snippet of music. Users can hum, sing, or type lyrics into the app, and it provides information about the song title, artist, and album. SOUN’s technology extends beyond music identification, incorporating voice-enabled AI solutions for various applications, including voice-controlled virtual assistants and integration into smart devices.\n\nWhy is the NVDA Investment Impactful?\n\nUntil now, NVDA has been selling the “picks and shovels” to the AI revolution. However, NVDA’s first 13F filing shows the company stepped out of its wheelhouse to purchase nearly $4 million worth of SOUN, showing the company also has ambitions for AI pure plays. Also, now that NVDA has the third largest market cap in the U.S., the company has plenty of cash to add exposure to their investment down the line – likely to keep a bid under SOUN shares. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBullish EPS Surprise History\n\nThough SOUN has only been public since early 2022, the company has exhibited a strong tendency to beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations. SOUN has bested Zacks EPS Estimates in six of its first eight quarters.

        "content": "Nvidia Corp. NVDA is poised to become the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation, marking an important milestone in its rise as the primary beneficiary of the surge in artificial intelligence-related stocks over the past year. The company's shares logged a 6.4% increase last week, closing at a valuation of $1.97 trillion, briefly surpassing the $2 trillion mark during intraday trading on Friday.\n\nThis solidifies Nvidia's position as the world's fourth-most valuable company, trailing only behind Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Saudi Aramco in terms of market capitalization. However, the stock slumped 2.1% in the past five days and Nvidia is currently sitting on $1.978 trillion of market cap.\n\nUnlike Apple and Microsoft, which took over two years to transition from a $1 trillion to a $2 trillion valuation, Nvidia is on pace to achieve this feat in less than a year, helped by an AI excitement. Notably, the rally in Nvidia's shares last week followed an impressive earnings report.\n\nInside Nvidia’s Q4 Earnings\n\nEarnings per share came in at $5.16, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and up a staggering 486% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues skyrocketed 265% year over year to a record $22.1 billion and edged past the consensus mark of $20.31 billion (read: Nvidia ETFs to Tap for More Growth Post Blowout Q4 Earnings).\n\nThe company provided guidance that exceeded expectations, driven by increased AI investments from major customers such as Meta Platforms Inc. META. Nvidia's domination in the market for graphics chips which is needed for computing tasks in AI applications has positioned it favorably in the current environment.\n\nNvidia Price Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $833.80. The forecasts range from a low of $475.00 to a high of $1,200.00. The average price target represents an increase of 7.36% from the last closing price of $776.63. While Nvidia lacks on value, the stock has upbeat momentum and growth score of A.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroker Rating\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.22 a month ago based on 39 recommendations.\n\nOf the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 84.62%, while Buy represented 7.69%.\n\nWhat Do Technicals Say?\n\nNvidia’s closing price was $791.12 as of Feb 29, 2024. NVDA's 200-day moving average is 481.62, 100-day moving average is 537.50 and 50-day moving average is 615.16, 20-day moving average is 725.50 and 5-day moving average is 786.77. Since, near-term moving averages are trending higher than the long-term average, there are chances of a price gain in NVDA shares in the near term.\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nThe stock’s RSI (14) value is 73.97, which means that the stock has just entered the overbought territory. On the contrary, Nvidia-heavy ETF VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH has an RSI value of 68.0 and bullish pattern of moving averages. Hence, investors who prefer diversification and less risks, may play NVDA-heavy ETFs like SMH, AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI, Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF PP and Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 1, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nThese 3 Companies Posted Record-Breaking Quarters\n\nEarnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple, NVIDIA and Celsius Holdings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn't the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt's worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises.\n\nShares couldn't hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin.\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA's Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity.\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year.\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector's strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including those above, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – March 1, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Cadence Design Systems CDNS and Amazon AMZN.\n\n\"It's a Bull Market You Know\": Top-Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend\n\nThis article's title, \"It's a bull market you know!\" is a quote from a famous investing book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, which accounts the life of famous speculator Jesse Livermore.\n\nThe book, which is a must read for any stock trader, details the wins and losses of Livermore's volatile life and shares many of his formative learning experiences. One of his earlier lessons occurred while he was hanging out at a brokerage firm he traded with. There he met a market veteran who went by the name Old Turkey.\n\nUp until this period Livermore was a very active trader, buying and selling shares at a high frequency, sometimes multiple times during the day. But this phrase from Old Turkey \"It's a bull market you know!\" stuck with Livermore.\n\nOld Turkey would repeat it over and while at first, he thought it was just a platitude he learned that it held much deeper insights than that. Instead of trading in and out of stocks, taking profits and waiting for a dip to buy again, this phrase was an encouragement to hold on to you winners for as long as possible.\n\nPersisting Bull Market\n\nBull markets often endure much longer than investors expect. In fact, the US stock market spends the vast majority of time in bull markets that steadily grind higher, climbing a wall of worry.\n\nThis insight deeply changed the way Livermore approached the market. Instead of quick profits he now focused on the big trends and owning the leading stocks for as long as the bull market persisted.\n\nAlthough Livermore's trading was marked by wild boom and busts, it was his overuse of leverage that was his Achilles heel. In fact, he would make huge profits riding these longer-term bull moves and occasional bear markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Market\n\nThe current market regime is one that has a litany of bullish tailwinds, and we are likely closer to the beginning of this bull market than the end. The factors include:\n\n- AI revolution: The hype is real – AI tech could be as influential as the internet has been and will make major contributions to productivity gains.\n\n- Strong economic growth: The US economy is showing above trend growth surprising nearly all economists on wall street.\n\n- Interest rate cuts: It won't be long before the Fed begins to lower rates again, beginning the expansionary cycle again.\n\nLeading Stocks\n\nOften, as a stock makes incredible gains, you will hear very loud voices talking about how \"it has gone too far!\" Just look at the commentary surrounding Nvidia, these traders have been saying this month after month, yet the stock pushes higher.\n\nLeading stocks lead for a reason, and in this current market they are leading because of growing sales and earnings. That is the opposite of hype and exactly what you want to see strong stocks do.\n\nAfter a little more than a year of using the Zacks Rank I have been continuously impressed by its ability to pick big winners. Nvidia and Meta Platforms sat on the list for the majority of 2023, when most analysts doubted them, yet they were the biggest winners in the S&P 500.\n\nThere are a handful of stocks sitting on the Zacks Rank right now that have performed very well recently and I think are likely to continue. They represent the secular economic trends of this economy, have strong business models, growing earnings and of course top Zacks Ranks.\n\nMeta Platforms and Nvidia are still on the top of the list, and both enjoy Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS for Nvidia are forecast to grow an incredible 30% annually for the next 3-5 years and Meta's are projected to climb 20% annually over the same period.\n\nThey also continue to show impressive relative strength against the market YTD.\n\nAnother company that is quietly making a significant contribution to the semiconductor and AI industry is Cadence Design Systems. The company builds software for designing chips and leads the space.\n\nSoftware within the semiconductor industry is a particularly appealing vertical. Semiconductor production is a very high capex intensive business, while software is a high margin low capex business. Candence Design enjoys gross margins of 90% and net margins of 26%.\n\nIn addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, CDNS also has a compelling technical trade setup. The price action of the stock has been forming a bullish consolidation, and a breakout should send the stock higher.\n\nAmazon is another leader that is likely to continue to lead. Both the ecommerce business and cloud services boast massive tailwinds with the expansion of online retail and digital transformation. Amazon web services dominates the cloud industry with 31% of the market share.\n\nAdditionally, its advertising business has exploded from seemingly nowhere and now contributes $60 billion a year to the top line annually. The emergence of this business shows that Amazon continues to execute at a high level as it enters new highly competitive industries.\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates are being upgraded significantly and EPS are expected to grow at a very high pace over the next 3-5 years. Earnings are projected to grow 28% annually over that time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere will be hiccups along the way, 5% and 10% corrections as the market continues higher, but don't let the bears scare you out of this market.\n\nIt's a bull market you know!\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc. COMM reported soft fourth-quarter 2023 results, with the bottom line and top line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower capital spending from customers, inventory adjustments, macroeconomic challenges and decrease in net sales in major business verticals led to top-line contraction year over year.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the net loss in the December quarter was $540.9 million or a loss of $2.55 per share compared to a net loss of $1.12 billion or a loss of $5.39 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant improvement despite top-line contraction was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP net loss was $3.9 million or a loss of 2 cents per share against net income of $138.1 million or 55 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents.\r\n\r\nFor 2023, CommScope reported a GAAP net loss of $1.51 billion or a loss of $7.17 per share compared with a net loss of $1.35 billion or a loss of $6.49 per share in 2022.

Quote\n\nRevenues\n\nRevenues for the reported quarter were $1.19 billion, down 38.4% from $1.93 million in the prior-year quarter. Net sales declined in major business verticals due to higher interest rates and global economic slowdown along with cautious customer spending. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 billion.\r\n\r\nSales in Connectivity and Cable Solutions were down 41.9% to $555.8 million compared with $957.1 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a decline in Network Cable and Connectivity and Building and Data Center Connectivity.\r\n\r\nSales in Outdoor Wireless Networks came in at $182.5 million, down 40.1% year over year, owing to lower product sales in Base Station Antennas and HELIAX.\r\n\r\nSales in Networking, Intelligent Cellular and Security Solutions decreased 24.9% to $216.7 million from $288.5 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily on a decline in Ruckus and Intelligent Cellular Networks.\r\n\r\nSales in Access Network Solutions totaled $230.9 million, down 38.4% year over year due to a decline in Access Technologies and Converged Network Solutions.\r\n\r\nFor 2023, net sales totaled $5.79 billion, down from the prior-year level of $7.52 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nGross profit decreased to $448.3 million from $725.4 million in the year-ago quarter due to lower revenue generation. Due to a significant decline in asset impairment charges, total operating expenses fell to $510.4 million from $1,628.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating loss totaled $62.1 million compared with a loss of $902.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $190.7 million compared with $375.2 million a year ago.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nFor 2023, CommScope generated $289.9 million in cash from operating activities compared with an operating cash flow of $190 million in 2022.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2024",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has gained 7% within the first two months of 2024, and it won't be surprising to see it jump higher as the year progresses, thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI stocks have played a big role in boosting the Nasdaq-100 in the past year, sending the index up nearly 54% as its components, such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), have delivered stunning gains of 233% and 181%, respectively. History suggests that the Nasdaq-100 tends to jump 24% on average following a year in which it achieved gains of 40% or more.\n\nSo, it won't be surprising to see the Nasdaq jump higher in 2024, especially considering the latest results from Nvidia and Meta Platforms. Let's look at the reasons why these two tech giants are all set to boost the Nasdaq and also check why now will be a good time to buy them.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's stock market rally got a nice boost after the company released fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Jan. 28, 2024) on Feb. 21. The chipmaker cruised past consensus estimates with record quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, a jump of 265% from the year-ago period.\n\nThe company was originally expecting its fiscal Q4 revenue to land at $20 billion. However, its efforts to increase the supply of its flagship H100 AI graphics processing unit (GPU) to meet the robust demand from customers helped it deliver stronger-than-anticipated growth.\n\nThat's not surprising as Nvidia's foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, has been aggressively increasing its advanced packaging capacity so that it can churn out a greater number of AI chips. Supply chain sources indicate that TSMC's chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) manufacturing capacity, which is used for making AI chips, is set to expand to 33,000 to 35,000 wafers a month by the fourth quarter of 2024. That would be more than double TSMC's estimated monthly CoWoS capacity of 15,000 wafers in December 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the supply of its AI graphics cards is improving. But what's interesting to note here is that Nvidia expects the demand for its GPUs to outpace supply despite the efforts it is undertaking to produce more chips. According to CFO Colette Kress, the company expects its \"next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\"\n\nNvidia will start ramping up the shipments of its next-generation H200 AI GPU in the second quarter. The company is claiming that this chip \"nearly doubles the inference performance of H100,\" which doesn't seem surprising as it is expected to be manufactured using a more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) chipmaking process as compared to the H100's 5nm process. Moreover, Nvidia is packing the H200 with more memory bandwidth and capacity.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia seems to be in a solid position to maintain its impressive share of the $67 billion AI chip market in 2024. Gartner estimates that $53 billion worth of AI chips were sold last year, and Nvidia's data center revenue of $47.5 billion indicates that it controlled 90% of this market last year. A similar share this year can help Nvidia sustain its momentum, which explains why its fiscal 2025 revenue is expected to increase 83% to $110 billion. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe market could reward such impressive growth with more upside. With shares of Nvidia trading at 33 times forward earnings, which is lower than the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 34, investors would do well to buy this AI stock right away since its bull run seems here to stay.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nJust like Nvidia, Meta Platforms is trading at an attractive 24 times forward earnings. Buying Meta stock at this valuation looks like a no-brainer, considering that its bottom line is expected to jump an impressive 34% in 2024 to $19.91 per share. Even better, analysts are anticipating Meta's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 26% for the next five years, a big improvement over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years.\n\nAssuming Meta can achieve this pace of bottom-line growth, its earnings could increase to $47.22 per share after five years, using its 2023 earnings of $14.87 per share as the base. If we multiply the projected earnings after five years with Meta's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 21, its share price could increase to $991. That would be a solid jump of 105% from current levels.\n\nAI is a key reason why Meta should be able to deliver the solid earnings growth that analysts are expecting from it. The company has been integrating generative AI into its advertising tools to help advertisers improve targeting and generate stronger returns on the advertising dollars they spend. From helping advertisers create multiple backgrounds for their ad campaigns based on product images to generating ad texts, Meta believes that its Ads Manager platform can \"unlock a new era of creativity that maximizes the productivity, personalization and performance for all advertisers.\"\n\nMeta points out that using generative AI in advertising has the potential to help advertisers save five or more hours every week while also boosting returns on ad spending by 32%. As a result, it won't be surprising to see Meta cornering a bigger share of the digital ad market, similar to what it did last year. The company's 2023 revenue increased by 16% to $134.9 billion, outpacing the 10.7% increase in digital ad spending.\n\nThis year, analysts are forecasting a 17.3% increase in Meta's revenue to $158.2 billion, suggesting that it is on track to outpace the 13.2% projected growth in digital ad spending, as per eMarketer. The digital ad market is expected to jump to an estimated $1.5 trillion in 2030 as compared to $531 billion in 2022. So, Meta's focus on using AI to improve its influence in this market suggests that it is setting itself up for long-term growth, which is why investors should consider buying Meta stock before it soars further.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 Tech Giants to Buy for Long-Term Gains as Nasdaq Thrives",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4%, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle in January, although finally, it closed the first month of 2024 on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index regained momentum in February finishing the month with a 6.1% rally. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 9% compared with a 7.5% gain of the S&P 500 and 3.4% of the Dow. Notably, all three major stock indexes saw the fourth consecutive month of positive ending.\n\nMeanwhile, on Feb 29, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% to close at 16,091.92, marking its first closing record since November 2021. Its peers the Dow and the S&P 500 posted several all-time highs on both an intraday and a closing basis in the first two months of this year. Now, the tech-heavy index has joined the bandwagon.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — along with a solid outlook provided by management, raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. (TSM) — the world's largest contract chipmaker — has projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales will reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite-listed technology behemoths namely NVIDIA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nMoreover, each stock’s long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate is well above the market’s benchmark S&P 500’s current long-term growth rate of 11.6%. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips in China for security reasons.\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, implying an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nZacks Rank #1 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 68.1% and 79.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nAmazon.com has benefited from the Prime and AWS’s momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed to the performance of AMZN. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed as well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continue to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positives. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nZacks Rank #1 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 28.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "content": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, it does have US$26.0b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$16.3b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.95t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with NVIDIA .\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt. You can access our special list of such companies (all with a track record of profit growth). It's free.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "According to Grand View Research, global cryptocurrency revenue hit $5 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% through 2030. While that growth is significant, it pales in comparison to the artificial intelligence (AI) market's CAGR of 37% for the rest of the decade and its value of $137 billion. NVDA Chart\n\nExcitement over cryptocurrency faltered in recent years as volatility has caused pullback from investors. The chart above compares the three-year growth between the most prominent cryptocurrency and three companies active in AI. Each tech company has performed significantly better than Bitcoin and potentially has more room to run in the coming years, thanks to AI.\n\nCryptocurrencies developed a reputation for inconsistency. However, it's just the opposite with tech stocks. The tech market is known for rewarding innovative companies with consistent gains over the long term, with that unlikely to change alongside a recent boom in AI.\n\nSo, here are three AI stocks with more potential than any cryptocurrency.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAll eyes have been on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) this year because its chips have become the go-to for developers across the AI market. The company's dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) gave it a leg up on its competitors, allowing it to secure an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI chips.\n\nSoaring demand for AI GPUs caused Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket. In the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily owed to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nNvidia's earnings could hit $34 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 32 projects a stock price of $1,094.\n\nConsidering its current position, these projections would mean Nvidia's stock rising 39% by fiscal 2027. In addition to a dominating position in a high-growth market like AI, Nvidia is a screaming buy this month with more potential than any cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nAs the home of potent brands like Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a tech behemoth and one of the biggest threats in the industry. The company's shares are up 65% in the last 12 months, and it recently surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap currently at just over $3 trillion.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft won over investors with an expanding role in AI. Heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI has led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry.\n\nThe Windows company used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup. In 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite by adding AI features.\n\nMicrosoft achieved more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year, highlighting the business's reliability and value as a long-term investment. MSFT EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nMicrosoft's earnings could reach nearly $16 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia, multiplying that figure by Microsoft's forward P/E of 35 yields a stock price of $550, projecting stock growth of 35% by fiscal 2026.\n\nWith its lucrative OpenAI partnership, Microsoft is a far better investment than any cryptocurrency.\n\n3. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nLike Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has massive potential in the hardware side of AI. The company got a late start in the industry, outrun by Nvidia last year. However, AMD is moving to challenge Nvidia's dominance soon and take its slice of the lucrative sector.\n\nLast December, the tech giant unveiled its MI300X AI GPU, designed to provide an alternative to Nvidia's products. The new chip already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\n\nMoreover, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by doubling down on AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to receive a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled.\n\nAMD has a solid outlook over the long term, and earnings-per-share estimates reflect this. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nAMD's earnings could hit just above $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying this figure by the company's forward P/E of 49 yields a stock price of $352. If projections are correct, AMD's stock price could double by fiscal 2026.\n\nAnd with that, AMD has significantly more potential than the crypto market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Citadel's Ken Griffin Oversees $500 Billion in Managed Assets: These Are His Top 5 Holdings",
        "content": "Three weeks ago, the most important data release of the first quarter occurred. On Feb. 14, while some people were shooting proverbial love arrows at their significant others, institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management were filing Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to see what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors have been buying, selling, and holding.\n\nDuring 13F season, it's not uncommon for investors to focus their attention on the moves made by billionaire asset managers. For instance, investors have used 13Fs to ride Warren Buffett's coattails at Berkshire Hathaway to market-trouncing returns. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut when it comes to making money, Citadel's Ken Griffin is in a class of his own. His firm's hedge fund, Citadel Advisors, closed out the December quarter with a whopping $500 billion in managed securities spread across thousands upon thousands of investments. Citadel has also generated a $74 billion net gain for its investors since its inception in 1990, which is tops among hedge funds.\n\nTo be fair, Griffin and his investment team do a lot of options hedging -- i.e., they lean on put-call spreads to hedge against their long positions. On a notional dollar basis (if the options were exercised), many of the fund's largest holdings are hedged option positions.\n\nRemoving options from the equation, we're left with five securities that Griffin and his team are betting on big-time. SPY Chart\n\n1. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust: $2.63 billion in market value (as of Dec. 31, 2023)\n\nDespite owning stakes in thousands of businesses, the largest non-derivative holding in Citadel's hedge fund is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY), which is an index fund that attempts to mirror the performance of the benchmark S&P 500. Griffin's hedge fund added more than 3.1 million shares in the fourth quarter, which brought this leading position to north of $2.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two good reasons Ken Griffin and his team have invested aggressively in this S&P 500-tracking index fund. First, bull markets historically last substantially longer than bear markets. According to a data set published last June by Bespoke Investment Group, the typical S&P 500 bull market (since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929) has stuck around for 1,011 calendar days. By comparison, the average S&P 500 bear market has resolved in just 286 calendar days.\n\nThe other reason to lean on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is that economic data hasn't produced any proverbial smoking guns signaling that the U.S. economy and stock market are in trouble. Although there are a couple of money-based metrics and predictive indicators that suggest a recession in the U.S. is likely in 2024, Griffin and his investment team have little reason to alter their strategy with corporate earnings remaining strong.\n\n2. Nvidia: $1.8 billion in market value\n\nThe second-largest non-options holding in Ken Griffin's hedge fund is none other than the hottest megacap stock on the planet, semiconductor kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The more than 3.63 million shares Citadel held at the end of December works out to a $1.8 billion stake.\n\nNvidia has quickly evolved into the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become staples of high-compute data centers where split-second decision-making is needed for AI software and systems. It's possible that Nvidia's GPUs could account for a 90% share of GPUs in use in AI-accelerated data centers this year.\n\nThe other catalyst for Nvidia is an expected ramping up of production of its high-powered GPUs. A sizable uptick in chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity from chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing should help Nvidia meet more orders this year.\n\nHowever, not everyone (i.e., me) is buying into the AI hype. Nvidia could easily cannibalize its pricing power, and it's set to face a lot of external and internal competition. To boot, U.S. regulators have clamped down on exports of its high-powered AI chips to China. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Microsoft: $1.61 billion in market value\n\nCitadel Advisors' third-biggest non-options stake in terms of market value is software and cloud titan Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Despite selling nearly 797,000 shares of Microsoft during the fourth quarter, Griffin's hedge fund still held 4.24 million shares (as of Dec. 31).\n\nThe lure of Microsoft has long been the blending of its cash-flow-rich legacy segments with its higher-growth initiatives. Though Windows and Office aren't the growth stories they once were, they're still responsible for a lot of cash flow that Microsoft has been able to repurpose in faster-growing projects.\n\nMicrosoft's bread-and-butter growth for the past couple of years has derived from its cloud services. In particular, Azure has claimed about a quarter of global cloud infrastructure service spend share. Azure grew currency-neutral sales by a staggering 28% in the December-ended quarter, which is phenomenal, considering how much it's already scaled.\n\nMicrosoft is also a logical candidate to benefit from the rise of AI. It's made big investments into OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and has been incorporating AI and generative AI solutions into its search engine and cloud infrastructure service platform.\n\n4. Amazon: $945.9 million in market value\n\nThe fourth-largest position by market value in Griffin's hedge fund is leading e-commerce company Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Citadel added over 4.3 million shares during the fourth quarter, bringing its total stake to more than 6.22 million shares.\n\nAlthough Amazon is responsible for roughly 38% of U.S. online retail sales, e-commerce is a low-margin segment for the company. What likely enticed Griffin and his team of researchers to pile into Amazon stock is the company's considerably faster-growing and higher-margin ancillary operations.\n\nNo segment is more important to the future of Amazon than its cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounted for nearly a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the third quarter of 2023. Since enterprise cloud spending is still in its relatively early stages, AWS can be counted on to expand by a sustained double-digit percentage.\n\nInterestingly enough, Amazon is historically cheap, too. If the company were to meet Wall Street's consensus cash-flow target of $13.79 per share in 2025, it would be trading at a 45% discount to its average cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\n5. Advanced Micro Devices: $885.3 million in market value\n\nThe fifth-largest non-derivative holding in Ken Griffin's $500 billion hedge fund is another semiconductor powerhouse, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). Griffin and his team added north of 3.5 million shares of AMD during the fourth quarter, which brought Citadel Advisors' position to about 6 million shares.\n\nAlthough AMD has been \"chipping away\" (it would be a crime not to make this pun) at Intel's central processing unit (CPU) share in data centers and personal computers (PCs) over the past couple of years, it's the company's potential in AI-accelerated data centers that's been raising eyebrows.\n\nIn June 2023, AMD unveiled its MI300X AI-driven GPU as a direct competitor to Nvidia's high-compute data center dominance. While the rollout of the MI300X went to only a small number of customers last year, production and delivery should ramp up in a big way in 2024. If demand for high-powered GPUs continues to outpace supply, AMD should enjoy exceptional pricing power.\n\nGriffin and his team might also be optimistic that AMD's legacy segments will pay dividends. A stabilization of the PC market, coupled with ongoing CPU share gains in data centers, PCs, and mobile, could add even more pep to AMD's skyrocketing stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-Wall Street hunts for more AI gold after Nvidia’s soaring rally",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Money managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market’s interest in artificial intelligence, as a stunning rally by Nvidia sparks a search for other companies that are capitalizing on the technology.\n\nShares of Nvidia - whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry - are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. The run has pushed its market value to roughly $2 trillion, making it the third-largest U.S. company by market cap after Microsoft and Apple.\n\nIt has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves. Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.\n\n“It's not a fad,\" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments' Large Cap Focused Fund. \"There are too many ... cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.”\n\nExcitement over AI helped power the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record high on Thursday, while the S&P 500 also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.\n\nFurther signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank’s analysts have estimated artificial intelligence technology could add 1.5 percentage points to U.S. productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nA Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers suggests 2024 is \"a Year of Investment for AI,\" the bank said in a note this week, with CIOs naming AI/machine learning as their top priority for the first time.\n\nBido’s fund retains a large holding in Nvidia, but has branched out into other AI plays, including rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and MongoDB, whose database products could be in high demand as AI is poised to change data infrastructure needs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose stocks have risen sharply, although less dramatically, than Nvidia and some other AI plays that have recently captured the market's attention. AMD shares are up 30% year-to-date, for example, while Mongo’s have risen 9%, though the shares of both companies doubled last year.\n\nBy contrast, shares of server component supplier Super Micro Computer and chip designer ARM Holding have jumped about 200% and 90%, respectively, in 2024. SMCI's shares tripled in 2023.\n\nIvana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest, said Nvidia has remained the biggest holding in its Spear Alpha ETF. But the exchange-traded fund has also sought to capitalize on growing cybersecurity needs related to AI by owning shares of Zscaler, a cybersecurity specialist. The fund's position in Snowflake, meanwhile, seeks to take advantage of data infrastructure demands.\n\nOf course, the risks of playing the often-volatile stocks of AI-related companies remain despite the technology’s higher profile. Shares of Snowflake, for example, fell 18% on Thursday after the company projected annual revenue below Wall Street estimates and disclosed the unexpected retirement its CEO.\n\nBaker Avenue Wealth Management trimmed its Nvidia holding as the stock has climbed so that it does not occupy too large a position in client portfolios, said King Lip, the firm’s chief strategist.\n\nBut the firm recently started building a position in Taiwan Semiconductor, a key supplier to Nvidia.\n\n\"If you still want artificial intelligence exposure but are perhaps a little skittish about Nvidia’s stock price, I think Taiwan Semi is kind of a no brainer,” Lip said.\n\nQue Nguyen, chief investment officer of equities at Research Affiliates, is looking for reasonably valued semiconductor companies that could stand to benefit from AI. Among them are Lam Research Corp, which supplies equipment to the semiconductor industry, and Micron Technology, which makes memory chips and data storage.\n\nLam Research shares are up about 20% so far this year, while Micron is up 6%.\n\n“Large language models are not just processing, you need to have storage,” Nguyen said.\n\nOf course, many investors are happy sticking with big Nvidia positions.\n\nThe Martin Currie US Unconstrained Fund has nearly 10% of its assets - the maximum the fund allows for one stock - in Nvidia, said portfolio manager Zehrid Osmani. He believes the company will maintain competitive advantages as it spends more heavily than rivals on research and development.\n\n\"We have high conviction in the name, and that's expressed through high position size,\" Osmani said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Additional reporting by David Randall in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)",

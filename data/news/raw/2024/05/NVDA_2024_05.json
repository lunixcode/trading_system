        "content": "Growth investing is widely popular, with investors targeting companies expected to grow their earnings and revenues at an above-average level.

Beauty ELF, and Wingstop WING could all be considerations.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia yet again blew away quarterly expectations in its quarterly print, with unrelenting demand for AI chips driving robust performance. Earnings and revenue grew 460% and 260%, respectively, whereas Data Center sales melted 430% higher from the same period last year.\n\nShares soared following the release, with the company enjoying post-earnings positivity all throughout 2024. In addition to a 10-for-1 split, the company also announced a 150% boost to its quarterly dividend payout, reflecting a shareholder-friendly nature.\n\nNvidia’s earnings outlook only continues to get brighter, with the stock remaining a highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares represent a prime opportunity for any investor seeking AI exposure, with demand expected to remain strong. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\ne.l.f. Beauty\n\nELF shares soared post-earnings, helping snap a nasty downtrend. Up nearly 30% in 2024, shares have widely outperformed relative to the S&P 500, building on years of outsized gains. The company’s quarterly consistency can’t be overlooked, beating consensus earnings and revenue expectations in 10 consecutive releases.\n\nThe company’s growth has been remarkable, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth consistently. Concerning its latest release, earnings grew 15% alongside a sizable 71% sales bump.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.

(5:40) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks For Your Watchlist (23:00) - Episode Roundup: MOD, ETN, GOOGL, MSFT, SMCI Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #371 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nNVIDIA recently reported earnings and the company talked about the “AI revolution.” Stock investors are eager to get into this trade, but the stocks have rallied big over the last year.\n\nIf you’re a value investor, you may be on the sidelines thinking that all of the AI stocks are just too expensive to even consider. But Tracey believes ALL investors should have some exposure to this new industry. However, that doesn’t mean she thinks you need to buy an expensive stock to get it.\n\nTrees don’t grow to the sky and no stock goes higher for forever. Even the mighty NVIDIA has had pullbacks and sell-offs in the last year during its incredible rally. There have been buying opportunities.\n\nValue investors should look for pullbacks and sell-offs in these stocks. They always come.\n\nWhat’s an “AI Stock”?\n\nThere are companies in several different industries that are currently considered “AI stocks.” The most well known is in the chips. NVIDIA has a lock on that market, for now.\n\nBut those chips go into data centers. Companies that are involved in the build-out, or servicing, of the data centers are also “AI stocks.”\n\nAnd then there are the companies doing business in generative AI. These are the companies using all that data that is at the data centers.\n\nIt takes a lot of electricity and other utilities, like cooling, to keep the data centers operational so there are “old economy” companies that are now “AI stocks.”\n\nAnd it won’t stop there. The AI industry will expand as the ecosystem builds out. But, for now, these are the most prominent areas to invest in.\n\n5 of the Cheapest AI Stocks to Buy Now\n\n1. Modine Manufacturing (MOD)\n\nModine Manufacturing has been involved in thermal management since 1916. Talk about “old economy.” In fiscal 2024, Modine’s data center business increased 69% year-over-year.\n\nShares of Modine Manufacturing have soared 61% year-to-date but it’s still attractively priced, with a forward P/E of just 27.\n\nShould a mid-cap company like Modine Manufacturing be on your AI stock watch list?\n\n2. Eaton Corp. (ETN)\n\nEaton is in power management. Founded in 1911, it has paid dividends every year since 1923. That’s as “old economy” as you can get.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut shares of Eaton are up 36% year-to-date to new highs as it’s now an AI stock. It’s not cheap, however. Eaton trades with a forward P/E of 32 and a P/S ratio of 5.7.\n\nShould power management companies like Eaton be on your watch list?\n\n3. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is known for advertising and for some of its products like YouTube. It has been deploying generative AI to roll out new products, including on Google Search.\n\nShares of Alphabet are up 21.8% in 2024 to new all-time highs. However, Alphabet remains one of the more attractive AI stocks due to its low P/E. No, Alphabet isn’t trading under 15x earnings, but it’s still attractive at 23x.\n\nCould Alphabet be one of the cheapest of the AI stocks?\n\n4. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft was among the first to roll out generative AI features in its products. As a result, investors have pushed up the stock to new highs. Microsoft shares have gained 7.9% year-to-date, but are off recent highs.\n\nMicrosoft is expensive at these levels. It is trading with a forward P/E of 35. But another indicator of value, its price-to-sales ratio, is also at sky-high levels at 13.5. A P/S ratio over 10 is considered high.\n\nShould Microsoft still be on your watch list at these valuations?\n\n5. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer provides service and storage solutions in cloud and data centers. It’s been one of the hottest AI stocks of the last year. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up 172% year-to-date.\n\nBut shares have pulled back over the last 3 months. Super Micro Computer has fallen 14.6% during that period. And while it trades with a forward P/E of 35, because of its incredible growth, Super Micro Computer has a PEG ratio of just 0.7. A PEG ratio under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value.\n\nIs this weakness a buying opportunity in Super Micro Computer?\n\nWhat Else Should You Know About Cheap AI Stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT and GOOGL in her personal portfolio.

        "title": "The Hypergrowth Hype Trap: 3 Stocks That Promise Moonshots But Deliver Duds",
        "content": "Hypergrowth stocks have tremendous allure. Investing in just one company like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its early days can lead to life-changing returns.\n\nBut for every Nvidia, there are countless other companies that appeared to have tremendous prospects but were unable to turn that potential into reality. That’s been particularly true in recent years.\n\nThe pandemic caused many companies to enjoy tremendous — but temporary — growth spurts. And the 2021 special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom unleashed many purported hypergrowth companies with dubious underlying fundamentals onto public markets. These are three overhyped growth stocks that have seen their fortunes evaporate as reality sets in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAstra Space (ASTR) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American aerospace company Astra Space on screen in front of web page.. ASTR stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAstra Space (NASDAQ:ASTR) is the perfect example of a company that promised investors the stars and but failed to make it off the ground.\n\nThe company offers satellite launch services. In its 2021 SPAC investor presentation, Astra claimed to have a $150 million backlog of commercial orders and a $1.2 billion pipeline within a fast-growing market. Astra expected to deliver investors rapid growth from verticals including broadband, maritime, internet of things, earth observation and government services.\n\nAt the time of its 2021 SPAC deal, Astra’s management projected that the company would generate $256 million in revenues in 2023. Well, 2023 came and went, so how did things actually pan out? Astra Space generated a grand total of $4 million in revenues last year, falling about 98% short of prior expectations.\n\nSeveral operational issues along with a strained balance sheet made it nearly impossible for Astra to carry out its original business plan. Given the company’s tailspin, Astra is reportedly considering filing bankruptcy this year. Ultimately, insiders came forward with a plan to take the company private at 50 cents per share.\n\nAs the stock debuted at a (split-adjusted) $150/share, this deal would lock in a greater than 99% loss for original investors. With ASTR stock still selling above 50 cents today, traders should sell now before either the take-under deal occurs or the company goes bust altogether. In any case, Astra stands as a stark reminder of what happens when unrealistic hypergrowth assumptions come undone.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s right there in the name. What was Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) stock supposed to do? Go up rapidly, of course.\n\nAnd, for a time, that’s exactly what it did. FSLY stock skyrocketed from $20 to more than $100 during the early days of the pandemic. Fastly operates an edge cloud platform that allows app developers and website operators to speed up and optimize their services.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2020, the marginal demand for internet optimization services dramatically outstripped supply as companies sought to get their products and services online as quickly as possible. Fastly’s notable client list included TikTok owner ByteDance.\n\nFastly enjoyed tremendous 45% revenue growth in 2020, and traders FSLY stock to the moon. At one point, the company hit a $15 billion market capitalization despite having less than $300 million in annual revenues at the time. At that price, it would have been almost impossible for Fastly to live up to investors’ sky-high expectations.\n\nFastly hasn’t fared quite as poorly as other 2021-era work-from-home winners. Fastly has grown revenues every year sequentially, and is on pace to grow the topline another 10% this year. But Fastly hasn’t yet managed to reach profitability, and its core edge computing services look a lot more like a commodity product today than they did during the early days of the boom.\n\nFSLY stock has dropped more than 90% from the all-time highs. And it is already down more than 50% year-to-date, adding insult to injury, following a couple of downbeat earnings reports. With internet and software spending dramatically slowing down this year, Fastly seems like it will be stuck in the mud for a long time to come.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTV streaming platform Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is another former hypergrowth stock that has now fallen on hard times.\n\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 virus, people were stuck at home and looking to improve their home entertainment setups. Roku enjoyed an unprecedented surge in adoption as folks discovered new media options while the world economy was closed down.\n\nROKU stock blasted off, soaring from $75 to a peak of more than $400. At first, this optimism seemed reasonable, as the company grew revenues from $1.7 billion in 2020 to $2.7 billion in 2021. At that growth rate, anything seems possible.\n\nHowever, revenue growth rapidly decelerated in 2022 and has further lost steam since then. Roku is set for around 12% revenue growth in 2024, which is fine but hardly the sort of thing people were imagining when they paid more than $400/share for the stock a few years ago.\n\nMaking matters worse, Roku is unprofitable now, and analysts see the company remaining unprofitable through at least the year 2026. Roku is seemingly running out of growth runway long before reaching sustainable profitability. That makes ROKU stock a risky bet today, and highlights the perils in paying huge valuations for emerging growth companies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Growth Stock Graveyard: 3 Former High-Fliers to Flee from Fast",
        "content": "Growth stocks can be an effective and lucrative way to play a volatile market. Since the start of 2024, the S&P500 and Nasdaq Composite indices have risen 11.2% and 11.5%, respectively. Driving these steadfast gains are relatively good earnings reports for a broad list of U.S. companies as well as optimism around the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. There are many high-flier stocks that saw their revenue and earnings grow over the former twelve months and have seen their share prices skyrocket as a result. AI chip developer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a key example of that.\n\nThere are also growth stocks that have certainly begun to fall out of favor with investors. Falling year-over-year sales growth rates, compressing margins and macroeconomic uncertainty are just some of shared traits of growth stocks that have entered the “growth stock graveyard.” Below are 3 former high-flier stocks that investors should be avoid at all costs.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) is a cybersecurity firm that has slowly gone out of the favor of investors over the past couple of years. If we look over a 3-year period, S shares have plummeted a catastrophic 51%. Raising interest rates coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty has caused cybersecurity customers to pullback their spending. While larger cybersecurity firms have also felt the brunt of this investment doldrum, SentinelOne has particularly been afflicted. SentinelOne prides itself on its AI-enabled, all-encompassing cybersecurity platform: Singularity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe platform’s uniqueness allowed SentinelOne to double sales from year-to-year for 2021 and 2022, but last year, it’s growth rate dramatically slowed.\n\nFor the complete fiscal year 2024, SentinelOne increased sales by 47% to $621.2 million compared to $422.2 million in fiscal year 2023. While this definitely represents strong double-digit growth, it is overshadowed by the higher growth figures the company was churning out in prior years.\n\nPoor guidance for fiscal year 2025 also put investors on edge. S shares have dropped 24% on a year-to-date basis, identifying it as one of the former high-flier stocks.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.\n\nSource: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.com\n\nElon Musk’s Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to have a rough year in 2024. TSLA shares have fallen nearly 29% since the start of the year. The downward pressure on the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s share price started when, in January, CEO Elon Musk issued poor guidance for the full year. Higher interest rates as well as record high car insurance premiums have put the brakes on the growth of the EV market. More, Tesla has had to worry about Chinese competitors, especially BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) eat away at its market share in the world’s largest EV market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe end of the first quarter marked Tesla’s first year-over-year decline in quarterly deliveries in years. To make matters worse, the EV maker’s sales in China fell 18% in April amidst the intensifying competitive landscape in the world’s second largest economy.\n\nTesla once was a key growth stock for many investors playing the EV sector, but now the growth stocks in the sector going forward are likely to be BYD and its close counterparts.\n\nUnity Software (U) The Unity Software website is displayed on a laptop screen. U stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline content has become the main medium of entertainment, and in that same vein, the enablement of various forms of online content creation has become a key growth engine for a plethora of internet tech companies. Unity Software (NYSE:U) is one of these companies, and it provides the software tools with which content creators can create 2D as well as 3D experiences for gamers. Despite being able to maintain solid, top-line growth rates in the double digits, the software company has struggled to contain its ballooning net losses. For example, in 2022, Unity Software’s net loss increased from $532.6 million in 2021 to $921 million in 2022.\n\nMost recently, Unity’s Q1 results for 2024 saw the firm’s quarterly net loss widen year-over-year. In the meantime, the software maker’s share price has dipped more than 53% since the start of the year. Over the past 3 years, shares have lost more than 80% of their value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

It anticipates that businesses will increasingly rely on private environments for AI computing needs.\n\nIntel aims to integrate AI capabilities across various products, from computers to edge computing to software, the Wall Street Journal cited Alexis Crowell, Intel’s VP and CTO for Asia-Pacific and Japan.\n\nCrowell noted that demand for traditional data centers might slow as companies seek a balance between public cloud infrastructure and private data storage for privacy and cost reasons.\n\nThis shift aligns with IDC’s prediction that by next year, 75% of enterprise-generated data will be processed outside traditional data centers or the cloud.\n\nIntel, traditionally strong in CPUs for personal computers and servers, faces challenges in the data center market dominated by Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI chips.\n\nDespite this, Intel’s data center and AI division saw a 5% revenue increase to $3 billion in Q1.\n\nThe company plans to bolster its AI chip offerings with the Gaudi 3 chip, which will likely outperform Nvidia’s H100 and generate $500 million in revenue in the latter half of 2024, WSJ writes.\n\nChip company CEOs, including Intel and Nvidia, have gathered at Taiwan’s Computex event to discuss AI’s prospects.\n\nCurrently, Intel andAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) are battling for the AI PC market’s dominance, while Nvidia sealed its numero uno position with its latest quarterly earnings beat.\n\nIntel has earmarked shipping chips for over 100 million AI PCs by 2025, including over 40 million in 2024.\n\nIntel stock lost over 4% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via ProShares Nanotechnology ETF (NYSE:TINY)\n\nand First Trust S-Network Streaming And Gaming ETF (NYSE:BNGE).\n\nPrice Action: INTC shares traded lower by 0.63% at $30.00 at the last check on Friday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Intel Eyes Increased AI Product Demand, Shifts Focus to Private Data Storage Solutions originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Investors looking for maximum returns should consider Alphabet GOOGL adding to their portfolios due to its solid fundamental strength.\r\n\r\nShares of the search giant have risen 23.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 18.1% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 11.5% during the same time frame.\r\n\r\nThis outperformance reflects the company’s back-to-back quarters of impressive financial performance. Alphabet’s earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.3%. In its last reported quarter, the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark and witnessed strong year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nWe believe that GOOGL shares have further room for expansion, given the company’s growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities. Its leading position in the search engine space, strengthening cloud footprint, solid momentum in YouTube and Android, and growing traction in the autonomous driving space should aid Alphabet’s prospects further.\r\n\r\nThe upswing in the company’s estimates testifies to the aforesaid fact. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues and earnings is pegged at $295.53 billion and $7.61 per share, respectively. This indicates year-over-year improvements of 15.2% in the top line and 31.2% in the bottom line. The EPS estimate has also moved 0.5% north over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nLet us delve deeper into the fundamental strength of Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Capabilities: Key Catalyst\n\nGoogle is well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\r\n\r\nThe company is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Growing momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\r\n\r\nGoogle recently introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units (TPUs), and NVIDIA’s GPUs in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe company’s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGrowing generative AI capabilities position Alphabet well to capitalize on the growth prospects in the booming generative AI market, which, per a report from Fortune Business Insights, is expected to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 47.5% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nSearch Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nThe strong efforts of Google toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search business are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in Search Generative Experience, which leverages the generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, should benefit Google’s search business in the near term.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s initiative to improve search results by combining LLMs’ capabilities with multi-search and visual exploration features is another positive. The growing momentum of Bard bodes well for search revenues.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus. These factors will continue to boost the search traffic on the Chrome browser.\n\nCloud Strength Drives Growth\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key growth driver of Alphabet, owing to strengthening cloud service offerings. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace has been driving growth in the Google Cloud segment.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are major positives. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and growing number of data centers are helping Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally is a major positive.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of generative AI-powered Workspace tools is a plus. Strength in Google’s Kubernetes offerings is contributing well to driving customer momentum.\r\n\r\nGOOGL’s efforts in integrating data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform are bolstering its prospects in the data cloud market.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nWe believe that Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong market position in generative AI, search engine and cloud. Strong financial health, combined with its commitment to innovation and strategic growth, positions it well for sustained success.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Tyler Technologies TYL and Nutanix NTNX, each flaunting Zacks Rank #1 at present.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA has surged 131.9% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $116.4 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 91%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $25.10 per share, which implies a 93.7% increase from that reported in fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nTyler Technologies has gained 14.2% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TYL’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pinned at $2.12 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 8.8%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $9.19 per share, which implies a 17.8% increase from the fiscal 2023 actual.\r\n\r\nNutanix has gained 18.1% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTNX’s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $2.14 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14.7%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.08 per share, which implies an 80% increase from the fiscal 2023 reported number.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Texas Utility Stock Powers Past Nvidia in 300% AI-Fueled Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The demand to feed the engines of artificial intelligence has helped vault shares of one of the largest US power producers, Vistra Corp., higher even than Wall Street darling Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Billionaires Are Rushing to Back Trump, Verdict Be Damned Donald Trump Becomes First Former US President Guilty of Crimes South Africa Election Results With 29% Voting Districts In Trump Is Guilty on All Counts in Hush-Money Case. Now What? Fed’s Favored Inflation Gauge Cools, Spending Unexpectedly Drops\n\nInvestors, including Daniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of Third Point LLC, have been snapping up Vistra stock in a bet that the massive boom in demand — partly fueled by power-sucking AI data centers — will only grow. That’s spurred shares to a more than 300% gain over the past 12 months, making the Texas-based firm the best performer in the S&P 500 Index — a benchmark it joined less than a month ago. Peers trailed, with utility stocks in the index returning about 10% over the same period.\n\n“Power demand is extremely strong, and it’s being driven by the data center trade,” but Vistra’s mix of gas and nuclear power plants make it “a unicorn,” according to Guggenheim’s Shahriar Pourreza who assigned the stock its highest price target on Wall Street at $133.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time high earlier in the week, shares sold off on Friday as Vistra detailed plans to add natural gas capacity in Texas. Investors are concerned this could be “the tip of an oversupply iceberg,” Pourreza wrote in a note to clients, but he views the changes as “somewhat modest.”\n\nAn array of utility companies are expected to benefit from the AI boom with data center power demand poised to more than double by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs’ estimates. But Vistra’s position as one of the few public independent power producers — a status that means it sells electricity at market prices, unlike regulated utilities — has left it in a league of its own and buoyed shares.\n\nAs Vistra is a direct participant in the market, “the clearest investment thesis is that wholesale power prices are going to increase,” Thomas Meric, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said in an interview.\n\nVistra’s roles as a big player in the surging Texas power market and — following the more than $6 billion acquisition of Energy Harbor Corp. — as a major owner of nuclear generation capacity are helping lure in investors. With the company’s nuclear fleet eligible for power-generation tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, it could also attract pacts from major AI players.\n\nStory continues\n\nData centers are looking for round-the-clock clean power, and “nuclear plants are a very strong avenue for that,” Guggenheim’s Pourreza said. Investors are anticipating the company will be able to contract its plants directly with data centers, similar to an energy-matching agreement between Constellation Energy Corp. and Microsoft Corp, he added.\n\nRead More: AI Boom’s Secret Winners? The Companies Expected to Power It\n\nOther key future catalysts would be the company’s first earnings-per-share guidance and a longer-term outlook from the company, Pourreza said.\n\nEven after the run, Vistra’s stock screens relatively inexpensive compared to other ways to play the AI and data-center booms, according to Janney’s Meric. The company trades around 17 times the next year’s earnings, compared to Nvidia’s multiple of 37. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive, with 10 of the 11 surveyed by Bloomberg giving the shares a buy-equivalent rating.\n\nMorningstar analyst Travis Miller, who has the lone sell recommendation on the stock, said the trends feeding the rally could falter. For one thing, growing renewable generation could squeeze legacy power producers in Texas.\n\n“The market has gotten a little too overexcited,” Miller said. Current analyst price targets suggest a cool down may be ahead with an average of $108 implying a 12% gain over the next 12 months, and even Pourreza’s $133 Street high suggests a slower pace of gains.\n\nBut for adherents, including activist investor Loeb, the expansion of renewable energy is another reason to buy in. The intermittent nature of wind and solar power supports the case for legislation favoring natural gas plants, like Vistra’s, that are available in a pinch, he wrote in an April letter.\n\nVistra was one of his hedge fund’s top five winners in the first quarter, and Loeb cited the power demand from data centers and electric vehicles as another reason for long-term confidence.\n\n“Vistra is in the pole position to capitalize on these trends,” he wrote. “We expect the discount applied to their assets to continue to narrow as their business becomes increasingly essential to serving domestic power demand.”\n\n--With assistance from Naureen S.

        "title": "NVIDIA is a shoo-in for the Dow post stock split",
        "content": "With its latest earnings report, AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a ten-for-one stock split. The split, which will be distributed at the close on June 7th, will give shareholders ten shares in exchange for each one share they own as of the June 6th record date. The stock will start trading split-adjusted at market open on Monday, June 10th. The split raises the very real possibility that NVIDIA will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), with chip-laggard Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) seen as the company it will likely replace.\n\nThe Dow is a price a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with higher prices have a bigger impact on the index. With NVIDIA’s stock over $1000 per share currently, this would give it too much of a weighting in the index. However, with the ten-for-one split, the stock price would be closer to the $100 level – making an entry into the Dow more feasible and likely.\n\nThe last change for the Dow was in August 2020, when Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) replaced ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).\n\nWhen asked to comment on speculation that NVIDIA will soon be added to the Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices, the firm behind the index, said it does not comment or speculate on index additions or deletions.\n\nHowever, reading the DJIA methodology language carefully hints that NVIDIA will, in fact, be added, and the announcement can come at any time.\n\nIt reads: “While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S. Changes to the indices are made on an as-needed basis. There is no annual or semi-annual reconstitution. Rather, changes in response to corporate actions and market developments can be made at any time. Constituent changes are typically announced one to five days before they are scheduled to be implemented. At any given time, the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones Transportation Average and Dow Jones Utility Average make up the Dow Jones Composite Average.” (bolded by Investing.com)\n\nStory continues\n\nFive reasons NVIDIA should replace Intel in the Dow\n\nNVIDIA is the third-largest company in the world, with a market value of $2.7 trillion—behind only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a market value of just over $3 trillion, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has a market value of $2.9 trillion. Apple and Microsoft are both in the Dow.\n\nIt is the leader in AI, powering applications like ChatGPT, which is expected to be bigger than the Internet.\n\nNVIDIA now dwarfs the once-mighty Intel, which has a market cap of only $128 billion. Intel is the lowest-priced stock in the Dow, and its market cap is near the bottom of the list.\n\nNVIDIA is expected to post revenue of $111.38 billion this year versus $52 billion for Intel. NVIDIA’s growth is also astonishing versus Intel’s lack of growth. NVIDIA’s revenue is expected to grow by 83% this year, while Intel’s is expected to fall by 5%.\n\nThe inclusion of NVIDIA in the Dow will also be an admission by the DJIA Index Committee that AI is the future of all industries, not just technology.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNVIDIA is a shoo-in for the Dow post stock split\n\nBoston Beer reportedly in sale talks to Suntory: WSJ\n\nUS lawmakers ask FBI for briefing on GenScript Biotech's links to China\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia could soon surpass Apple to become the world's second-most valuable company, as the kingmaker behind the AI revolution takes on the iPhone maker that has ruled Wall Street for decades.\n\nThe reliance of virtually all artificial intelligence applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT on Nvidia's high-end chips has helped the stock nearly triple in value over the past year to $2.72 trillion.\n\nIn contrast, Apple ceded its No. 1 spot to Microsoft earlier this year as the once high-flying company grapples with weak demand for its iPhones and tough competition in China. It was last valued at $2.93 trillion.\n\n\"It is certainly notable because Apple has been so dominant for so long, especially on the growth and innovation front. Recently though, Apple's innovation curve seems to have flattened, showing slower future growth,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\n\"On the other hand, Nvidia has been able to catch wave upon wave of growth. Beginning with gaming demand, then crypto and now AI, they have been able to perfectly match innovation with demand and that equals explosive growth.\"\n\nThe semiconductor company is heavily weighted on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq and has been pivotal in driving U.S. stocks to record highs. It accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.\n\nNvidia also became the fastest company to grow from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in 2024, zooming past Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco.\n\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphic processors far outstripping supply as Big Tech rushes to embed AI applications.\n\nSharp increases in analysts' earnings estimates have resulted in a fall in the stock's forward earnings valuation, even with the share price racing higher.\n\nIt traded at 37 times forward earnings, compared with 48 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.\n\nNvidia is also popular in the derivatives market. GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which tracks twice the daily percentage change in Nvidia, is the largest single stock ETF.\n\nThe fund clocked $1 billion in daily turnover for the first time ahead of Nvidia's results last week and its total net assets have hit a record $2.82 billion this week, according to Lipper data.\n\nOptions traders are bullish as Nvidia's volumes, particularly for calls, has picked up in recent sessions after the surge in its stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday marked the fifth straight session where more than a million Nvidia call options changed hands, the longest such streak in the stock's history, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 Best-Performing Leveraged ETFs of May",
        "content": "Wall Street has been on a solid rally in May, buoyed by renewed Fed rate cut bets, solid corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. All three major bourses hit record highs this month, touching new milestones. The S&P 500 crossed 5,300, the Dow Jones Industrial Average touched 40,000 and the Nasdaq Composite Index topped 17,000 for the first time ever (read: Nasdaq Tops 17K: 5 Best-Performing Stocks in ETF YTD).\r\n\r\nFor the month, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have risen nearly 7% and 4%, respectively, while the Dow has gained just 0.8%.\r\n\r\nHere, we highlight a bunch of the best-performing leveraged equity ETFs from different corners of the market that are leaders in their segments. These include T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX, ProShares Ultra Semiconductors USD, ProShares Ultra Silver AGQ, Direxion Daily Global Clean Energy Bull 2X Shares KLNE and Direxion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares UTSL. These funds will continue to be investors’ darlings, at least in the near term, provided the sentiments remain bullish.\r\n\r\nLeveraged ETFs provide multiple exposures (2X or 3X) to the daily performance of the underlying index. These funds employ various investment strategies, such as the use of swaps, futures contracts and other derivative instruments to accomplish their objectives.\r\n\r\nEarnings grew 6% in the first quarter of 2024, the highest rate of growth seen in nearly two years. NVIDIA’s NVDA blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism in the stock market in recent weeks along with the global AI boom (read: NVIDIA's Explosive Earnings: Should You Buy the Stock or ETFs Now?).\r\n\r\nThe latest bouts of data showed that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. U.S. business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth, led by an upturn in the service sector. Consumer confidence, as indicated by the Conference Board’s gauge of sentiment, increased in May after three months of declines.\r\n\r\nWall Street is getting more bullish on stocks, given the improving outlook for both earnings and economic growth. Over the past two weeks, three equity strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have boosted their year-end targets for the S&P 500. The median target on Wall Street for the benchmark index now sits at 5,250, up from the median target of 4,850 on Dec 30, per Bloomberg data.\r\n\r\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nHowever, uncertainty about the timing of rate cuts continued to weigh on investors’ sentiment lately, curtailing some of the gains made until last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) – Up 53.3%\r\n\r\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF seeks to magnify (200%) the daily performance of the NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA). It has AUM of $459.5 million and an expense ratio of 1.05%. T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF trades in average daily volume of 846,000 shares.\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors (USD) – Up 31.4%\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors offers two times (200%) exposure to the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index. It has gathered $1 billion in its asset base and charges 95 bps in fees per year from investors. USD trades in an average daily volume of 310,000 shares.\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ) – Up 28.4%\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Silver seeks to deliver two times the daily performance of the Bloomberg Silver Subindex. It has amassed $550.5 million and charges investors 95 bps in annual fees. The fund trades in an average daily volume of 1.5 million shares (read: ETFs Ride on Decade-High Silver Prices: Will the Rally Last?).\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Global Clean Energy Bull 2X Shares (KLNE) – Up 23.5%\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Global Clean Energy Bull 2X Shares creates two times leveraged long position in the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. It charges an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in a lower average daily volume of about 11,000 shares. Direxion Daily Global Clean Energy Bull 2X Shares has accumulated $3.9 million in its asset base.\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares (UTSL) – Up 18.9%\r\n\r\nWith AUM of $38.5 million, Direxion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares offers three times exposure to the performance of the Utilities Select Sector Index. It charges investors an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in a lower average daily volume of 215,000 shares (read: Here's Why Utility ETFs Are Scaling New Highs).\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs a caveat, investors should note that these products are extremely volatile and suitable only for short-term traders. Additionally, the daily rebalancing — when combined with leverage — may make these products deviate significantly from the expected long-term performance figures (see: all the Leveraged Equity ETFs here).\r\n\r\nStill, for ETF investors bullish on the stock market for the near term, either of the above products can be an interesting choice. Clearly, a near-term long could be intriguing for those with high-risk tolerance and a belief that the trend is the friend in this corner of the investing world.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Secret Stocks With Staying Power: 3 Overlooked Picks Built for the Long Haul",
        "content": "If you have a long-term investment horizon, then focusing on stocks with staying power can be a great way to build wealth. These overlooked long-term stocks usually have strong industry moats or sticky products and services for their customers. Even if they don’t provide the same hyper-growth as high-flying tech stocks, they usually come with less volatility and greater peace of mind.\n\nWhen we use the term secret stocks, it does not necessarily mean unknown companies. Rather, when the bright lights shine on the same high-profile companies, these secret stocks offer a less-crowded trade and strong, longer-term performance without any of the headlines. Here are three secret stocks we believe can help your portfolio grow for years to come.\n\nFreeport-McMoran (FCX) Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy Status\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nFreeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) has long been viewed as just another precious metal mining company. While many focus on mining gold, FCX has emerged as the world’s largest copper miner. Wall Street analysts can see the light with FCX, providing a one-year price target range of $41.62 to $55.49. While this only implies about a 10% upside, these targets will likely be revised as the price of copper continues to rise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou might be wondering what all the excitement is about copper. With the recent surge in demand for data centers to power artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies, investors are realizing that we’re going to start needing a lot more copper. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced earlier this year that they are moving from fiber optic cables to copper wiring in its data centers. Not to mention, copper is a critical component in other technologies like electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nThe stock has seen an uncharacteristic spike in price this year, already gaining 22.4% in 2024. This has caused its stock multiples to increase as shares now trade at 32x forward earnings and 3.1x sales. These are historically high for FCX, although, with rising demand for copper, the company should easily be able to grow into these multiples.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who have been around for a couple of decades might be wondering why Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is trending again. In recent weeks, Dell has been rejuvenated and is trading at all-time high prices. Analysts on Wall Street are expecting more from Dell as the stock has a street-high price target of $197.00 which is about 25% higher than its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo what has Dell’s stock hitting new all-time highs in 2024? Like FreePort-McMoran, Dell is also benefiting from the emergence of the AI industry and a friendly shoutout from an old friend at Nvidia. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has always had a soft spot for Dell which used Nvidia’s chips in its laptops when others would not. Huang has returned the favor by suggesting that Dell builds the best enterprise end-to-end systems and that the company is a key to widespread AI adoption.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, Dell’s stock is seeing some price multiple expansion. Shares are trading at their highest levels in years at 21x forward earnings and 1.3x sales. Investors likely want to see Dell prove it before they believe it but as long as it can stick with Nvidia, the stock should continue to do well. It’s not likely to be one of the overlooked long-term stocks for long at this rate.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last pick for stocks with staying power has a simple bull thesis: everyone creates garbage. Waste Management (NYSE:WM) is the world’s largest waste and recycling brand by market cap. It has long been a favorite of Wall Street analysts and this is indicated by their bullish price targets. WM is currently trading below the lowest price target of $210 and is well below the average price target of $228.16.\n\nWaste Management has 53% of the market share of American waste removal services. While waste management will always be an essential service for any society, this company has started to branch out. Waste Management is also branching into energy production by converting landfill gases (LFG) into an energy source. The company has also converted most of its fleet to compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles.\n\nAlthough it may seem just like other overlooked long-term Stocks, WM has provided excellent shareholder returns. Over the past five years, WM has returned more than 90% to shareholders as well as an 8.5% CAGR for its dividend. Shares trade at 29x forward earnings and 4x sales which is right in line with its historical multiple, even though revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 7.0% over the past five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) International Revenue in Focus: Trends and Expectations",
        "content": "Did you analyze how Nvidia (NVDA) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending April 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\n\nBeing present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors.\n\nWhile delving into NVDA's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nThe recent quarter saw the company's total revenue reaching $26.04 billion, marking an improvement of 262.1% from the prior-year quarter. Next, we'll examine the breakdown of NVDA's revenue from abroad to comprehend the significance of its international presence.\n\nA Closer Look at NVDA's Revenue Streams Abroad\n\nOther countries accounted for 6.3% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $1.65 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -59.96%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $4.11 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other countries contributed $7.99 billion (36.2%) and $659 million (9.2%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, China (including Hong Kong) contributed $2.49 billion in revenue, making up 9.6% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $4.41 billion, this meant a surprise of -43.48%. Looking back, China (including Hong Kong) contributed $1.95 billion, or 8.8%, in the previous quarter, and $1.59 billion, or 22.1%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOf the total revenue, $4.37 billion came from Taiwan during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 16.8%. This represented a surprise of -19.01% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $5.4 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $4.44 billion, or 20.1%, and $1.8 billion, or 25%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Market Revenue Projections\n\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that Nvidia will report a total revenue of $28.25 billion, which reflects an increase of 109.1% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 15.9% from Other countries ($4.49 billion), 15.5% from China (including Hong Kong) ($4.39 billion) and 20.5% from Taiwan ($5.8 billion).\n\nFor the full year, the company is expected to generate $116.4 billion in total revenue, up 91.1% from the previous year. Revenues from Other countries, China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan are expected to constitute 14.9% ($17.33 billion), 15% ($17.4 billion) and 19.5% ($22.66 billion) of the total, respectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nRelying on international markets for revenues, Nvidia faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\n\nIn a world where international interdependencies and geopolitical conflicts are ever-increasing, Wall Street analysts closely monitor these trends for companies having international presence to adjust their earnings forecasts. Of course, there are several other factors, including a company's standing within its home borders, that influence analysts' earnings forecasts.\n\nHere at Zacks, we put a great deal of emphasis on a company's changing earnings outlook, as empirical research has shown that's a powerful force driving a stock's near-term price performance. Quite naturally, the correlation is positive here -- an upward revision in earnings estimates drives the stock price higher.\n\nBoasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia, bearing a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is expected to outperform the broader market's movements in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nA Review of Nvidia's Recent Stock Market Performance\n\nThe stock has witnessed an increase of 28.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's an increase of 4.1%. In the same interval, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, to which Nvidia belongs, has registered an increase of 7.7%. Over the past three months, the company's shares saw an increase of 19.2%, while the S&P 500 increased by 3.2%.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Recommends Buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Heading Into June",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for June. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks higher in the list, the stock deserves a deeper look. But first, let's see what Cramer was talking about during his programs earlier this week.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program lamented over Salesforce's latest declines following the company's weak Q1 results and guidance cut. Cramer said he's been \"championing\" Salesforce ever since the company went public since he's used the Cloud software company's product when he started Street.com. Cramer said Salesforce has been one of the most \"distinguished\" members of the enterprise software industry. Cramer identified competition as one of the biggest threats to Salesforce, since he believes every other \"young person\" coming out of the school majoring in computer science knows if you want to make money you should make or sell software for the enterprise world.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence revolution is jolting the SaaS world to its core, according to Cramer, as companies begin to explore the power of AI and question whether they should keep paying for SaaS subscriptions or hire more people when AI-based tools can do similar jobs in a more efficient way.\n\nCramer's NVDA Thesis Still Holds?\n\nJim Cramer, however, said that companies that are making AI transition easier for companies are in \"ascendancy.\" He thinks a personal computer equipped with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell Platform could make \"vast swaths of workforce obsolete.\" Cramer has been recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past several months, and in his latest programs he yet again urged investors to buy and hold the stock. However, valuations concerns around NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are increasing. NVDA bears believe the Wall Street's EPS estimate for NVDA for two years from now, which is close to $40 (latest quarterly EPS was $5.98), would only hold if Cloud and software companies continue to buy Nvidia chips at a rate that we are seeing today. Since major Cloud companies are \"front-loading\" chips amid competition and data center boom, it's highly unlikely Nvidia continues to see this high sales and income growth in the long term.\n\nOur latest research unlocked many AI-related stocks trading at attractive valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired over the past two weeks and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in the company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nA caller highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest show that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock recently shot up after latest data from China showed a rebound in iPhone sales. Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) shows that iPhone shipments in April surged 52% to 3.489 million units, driven by discounts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is offering to lure back customers. Cramer said the stock jumped on the news but pared back gains. Cramer thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"is a buy here\" and reiterated his age-old mantra:\n\n\"I want you to own it, not trade it.\"\n\nInvestors are also looking over their shoulders for any major AI announcement by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), especially during the upcoming Developers Conference. Bank of America recently reiterated an Outperform rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). BofA's Wamsi Mohan, who has a $230 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), is expecting AI-phone related announcements in the Developers Conference.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shot up in the first quarter, with 150 hedge funds ending the period with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares in their portfolios, up from 131 funds in the previous quarter.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter due to the strategy’s underweight relative to the benchmark. Investors continue to be concerned about weak handset sales globally, as well as declining market share and competitive dynamics in the Chinese market, as Huawei has returned to the market with a more competitive premium-priced handset. Apple has yet to demonstrate a competitive AI product, which could present further competitive headwinds for the company.”\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 1st in Insider Monkey’s list of the Jim Cramer's 10 Stock Picks Heading Into June.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "With its share price up by a remarkable 24,000% over the last 10 years, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a life-changing investment for shareholders who have held on for the long haul. But past performance isn't a guarantee of future results, and investors who buy its shares now are buying at the top of a mountain. What might the next 12 months have in store for this soaring chipmaker?\n\nFirst quarter earnings were a blowout\n\nAlthough Nvidia's parabolic stock price chart might make it look like it is in a speculative bubble, it isn't. The company's fundamentals have justified the rally, and its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results showed that its exceptional growth continues.\n\nIn the period, which ended April 28, revenue grew 262% year over year to $26 billion, driven by relentless demand for Nvidia's high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the variety used to run and train artificial intelligence (AI) models. These chips are expensive, and demand is exceeding supply, giving Nvidia incredible pricing power. The company's gross margin rose to 78.4% -- up 2.4 percentage points from the previous quarter and 13.8 percentage points year over year.\n\nNvidia is essentially selling physical hardware at software-level margins. Its rising gross margin suggests that the arrival of competing GPUs from peers like Advanced Micro Devices is not putting much pressure on its market share.\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI chips based on Nvidia's new Blackwell infrastructure (designed to train AI algorithms faster and with greater energy efficiency) will extend the company's technological lead and allow it to maintain (or even grow) its already incredible pricing power.\n\nExpect more profits and value returned to shareholders\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia's impressive top-line growth has led to equally impressive bottom-line performance. In its fiscal Q1, net income rose by 628% year over year to $14.9 billion. And the company is getting more serious about returning some of this value to shareholders -- it increased its quarterly dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share.\n\nTrue, that gives it a trivial yield of just 0.02%. But Nvidia is also returning value through share repurchases. The company authorized a $25 billion stock buyback in late 2023, which (albeit minimally) will lower the number of shares outstanding and increase their fundamental value relative to future earnings and cash flow.\n\nOver the coming year, investors should expect Nvidia's management to try and return more capital to shareholders, although future buyback authorizations will be controversial, considering the stock price is near record highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Nvidia the next Cisco?\n\nWhile Nvidia stock itself isn't in a bubble, the underlying demand powering its growth (the generative AI industry) might be. Famous technology sector investor Cathie Wood compares the company to Cisco -- an internet hardware provider that boomed during the dotcom bubble before crashing when the tech sector deflated in the early 2000s.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough the internet eventually became one of the biggest technological megatrends of our lifetimes, it didn't take off as quickly as investors initially expected. And Cisco never regained the high valuation it enjoyed during the height of the bubble. Nvidia could face a similar risk if the software side of the AI industry doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, AI chatbots are still losing money on every search query because of their high training and operational costs. While demand for AI hardware is high now, it is unclear how long the market can stay elevated if the consumer-facing software side of the industry doesn't step up dramatically in the next 12 months.\n\nThe stock still looks good, but don't get greedy\n\nAlthough it may be hard to believe, Nvidia's stock is still relatively affordable. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 42, it is just moderately higher than the tech-heavy NASDAQ-100's average of 32. And this is a small price to pay for a company growing at a triple-digit percentage rate.\n\nThat being said, investors shouldn't get carried away. Over the next year, Nvidia's comps will get much more difficult, and its valuation will become harder to justify based on growth. The consumer-facing AI software industry will also need to start showing more results to justify the huge amount of capital being poured into Nvidia's hardware.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock still looks capable of outperforming the S&P 500, investors should make sure to diversify their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The real estate investment trust (REIT) industry has been a favorite among income investors and dividend seekers. Why? Because REIT stocks provide a steady monthly or quarterly distribution while also providing stability to any portfolio. In exchange for this stability and consistency, you generally will see relatively little price appreciation for REIT stocks, which can sometimes cap the potential upside of your investment.\n\nREITs also aren’t valued by regular price multiples like other stocks. Instead, REITs use a metric called “Funds From Operations” or FFO. This is a better indication of how financially healthy a REIT company is.\n\nGenerally, REIT stocks are best suited for investors with a conservative strategy and low-risk tolerance. They are also beneficial for investors in or nearing retirement and seeking to produce income from their investments. However, any portfolio looking for just a touch of stability can benefit from strong REIT exposure. As such, this article will highlight three such REIT picks that you should consider adding to your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) Image of computer servers lined up in a dark room\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is a REIT that focuses on owning and operating data centers. It rents out the spaces and facilities needed for companies to store equipment and build up data centers. Overall, Wall Street remains bullish on DLR with an average analyst price target of $147.53 and a street-high target of $175.00.\n\nThe demand for data centers to run advanced technologies like AI and machine learning has never been higher. One only needs to look at the recent earnings report from NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The AI leader reported a 400% year-over-year growth in its data center revenue from 2023. Not surprisingly, Digital Realty and NVIDIA already have a strong partnership in place that is set to synergize into more long-term growth.\n\nDLR has managed to continue to grow its FFO by a compounding annual growth rate of 11% from 2005. As of May 2024, it sits at an impressive $6.60 to $6.75 per share. With over 300 data centers under its control, Digital Realty is set to thrive from the rising demand for AI from some of its partners including Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. As a cherry on top, DLR pays a quarterly distribution with a current yield of 3.42%.\n\nCrown Castle International (CCI) a ground-up view of multiple cell towers in a circle\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCrown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) is a REIT that rents out cellular towers and infrastructure to telecommunications companies. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $110.87 for CCI which represents nearly 15% upside from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis REIT company owns more than 40,000 cellular towers and over 90,000 miles of fiber optic internet cable. One unique aspect of Crown Castle is that it operates solely in the United States. This sets CCI apart from other wireless infrastructure REITs like American Tower (NYSE:AMT). This localization to just the U.S. has also allowed Crown Castle to be the go-to REIT when renting out towers to major American telecom companies like T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and AT&T (NYSE:T).\n\nIf there is one thing Crown Castle cares about, that’s returning capital to shareholders. This REIT pays a quarterly distribution with a current yield of 6.38%. Crown Castle also has a long-term dividend growth target of 7% to 8% annually. With an impressive trailing twelve months FFO per share of about $7.50 to top it off. Thus, it would be foolish not to keep this company on your watchlist.\n\nWP Carey (WPC) a wooden house shape holds 3 bags of cash representing reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWP Carey (NYSE:WPC) is one of the world’s largest diversified net lease REIT companies in the world. The one-year price target range for this REIT is $55.00 to $65.00 with an average analyst target of $59.78. The high end of the range indicates a nearly 20% upside from the current price of WPC.\n\nSo what exactly is a net lease REIT? WP Carey purchases properties from companies and then immediately leases them back for a monthly rental fee. This allows the companies to raise money and capital while providing WP Carey with a reliable and trustworthy tenant. Recently, the company has chosen to exit the office sector in hopes of entering a transformational phase to replace its portfolio with stronger growth prospects.\n\nWith its business model producing such reliable rental income, it shouldn’t be a surprise that WPC pays a quarterly distribution with a yield of 6.09% to shareholders. While its recent FFO of $1.14 per share dipped slightly YOY, we remain certain that WPC is a great long-term investment that is transforming into a higher-growth diversified pick.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Dividend Sweet Spot: 3 Stocks Balancing Yield and Growth Perfectly",
        "content": "Investors can choose from several dividend investing strategies, including the two most popular ones: growth and income. A dividend growth investing strategy focuses on a stock’s long-term appreciation potential. These stocks can keep up with the market or even outperform it, but they often have low yields. It’s common to see dividend growth stocks with yields below 1%.\n\nDividend income stocks offer high yields but very little upside. Many telecom companies have high yields but don’t offer much upside beyond 6% yields. However, there are a few stocks that combine the best of both worlds. It’s possible to find stocks with yields above 1%, annualized dividend growth rates above 10% and market-beating returns. These three picks check all of the boxes.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) stock has more than doubled over the past five years, putting its returns higher than the S&P 500. The stock is also off to a strong start with a 26% year-to-date gain. Shares trade at a 20 P/E ratio and come with a 1.18% yield.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe credit and debit card issuer has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for many years. American Express recently upped the ante with a 17% dividend hike. The quarterly dividend payout now comes to $0.70 per share.\n\nRevenue and net income growth continue to delight as people use their cards more often. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while profits were up by 34% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024. American Express has a multi-year growth plan that forecasts 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens beyond 2026. Those projections suggest that profit margins will expand and that the stock has more room to run.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a top AI beneficiary due to its top-tier chips. Broadcom’s semiconductor technology powers up many everyday devices, and it’s been a boon for investors. The stock is up by 30% year-to-date and has soared by 459% over the past five years.\n\nWhile growth is good for long-term investors, it comes at a cost for dividend investors. As Broadcom’s price continues to march higher, its yield becomes smaller. Even with those incredible gains, Broadcom still has a very respectable 1.49% yield. Furthermore, Broadcom has an annualized dividend growth rate of 17.49% over the past five years.\n\nThe semiconductor giant can march higher if it announces a stock split. While a stock split does not increase a company’s value, it brings more attention to the stock. Options traders will also have an easier time trading the stock which will drum up volatility. Broadcom has not announced a stock split, but there is some speculation that a split can be on the way. A stock split makes more sense since Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently announced its own and Broadcom shares trade above $1,400 apiece.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant stocks have been taking off in recent months. That boom has resulted in many lofty valuations that will be difficult for these stocks to maintain in the future. However, investors can get a better margin of safety and a respectable yield with Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH)\n\nThe American steakhouse chain has a 34 P/E ratio and a 1.45% yield. The company has a good dividend growth program, which includes a recent hike from $0.55 per share to $0.61 per share. That’s a 10.9% year-over-year increase for the quarterly payout.\n\nTexas Roadhouse is up by 41% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. It only has an $11 billion market cap and is expanding with company restaurants and franchises. The company’s restaurant count is up by 7% year-over-year, going from 704 to 753. Texas Roadhouse added 12 new locations this quarter (9 company restaurants and 3 franchises). The company only opened seven new locations in Q1 2023. Continued acceleration and solid financials point to more potential gains.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AVGO and TXRH.

        "title": "3 Underappreciated Stocks with Triple-Digit Upside: May 2024",
        "content": "There are plenty of underappreciated stocks on the market.\n\nLook at Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), for example.\n\nWhen I first highlighted VKTX on June 22, 2023, it traded at just $22 a share. At the time, it was nearing Phase 2 trials, with Phase 1 already showing the VK2735 triggered feelings of fullness in the body, which can help lead to weight loss.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, even with that news, the stock was unappreciated. Today, though, as its story and the weight loss treatment boom have become far more popular, VKTX now trades at $63.81 after testing a high of almost $100.\n\nEven now, as we wait for further trial results, the stock is still being underappreciated. This time after it reported favorable Phase 2 results. However, I don’t believe it’ll stay underappreciated for much longer.\n\nI still believe it could push well above $100 a share long term. While VKTX is a great stock to buy and hold, here are other unappreciated stocks to consider.\n\nNewLake Capital Partners (NLCP) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nWith the cannabis story heating up, real estate investment trusts like NewLake Capital Partners (OTCMKTS:NLCP) are still considered one of the top underappreciated stocks.\n\nWith a yield of 8.55%, the REITowns a portfolio of 31 properties comprised of 14 cultivation facilities and 17 dispensaries. It’s also seeing impressive earnings. In its first quarter, funds from operations (FFO) came in at 50 cents, beating estimates by four cents. Revenue of $12.6 million, up by 10.5% year over year beat by $620,000.\n\nPresident and CEO Anthony Coniglio also added, “Looking forward, the cannabis industry has much to be excited about following the proposal to reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule 3, an increase in meaningful dialogue among congressional leaders, and medical to adult-use conversion in Ohio and the Adult-use ballot in Florida.”\n\nWith key votes in Florida nearing, and the upcoming presidential election, I’d use the recent pullback in NLCP as a buy opportunity. Plus, while we wait for the cannabis REIT to see higher highs, we can just collect its 8.55% yield.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother underappreciated REIT to consider is Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR).\n\nWith a yield of 3.45%, DLR data centers are essential for our digital world, especially with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nRemember, everything that happens online depends on data centers. They operate 24/7 ensuring the continuous operation of essential digital services all over the world. They make it possible for us to interact and do business through our smartphones and computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter, according to Goldman Sachs, data center demand is expected to rise at a 15% CAGR between now and 2030.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle CEO Christian Ulbrich says there’s soaring demand for data centers with AI. “It’s the hottest asset class at the moment,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “When you believe in AI, the demand for data centers will only go up.”\n\nFrom its current price of $141.40, I’d like to see the DLR stock race back to $150 initially.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt just $4.70 with heavyweight investors behind it, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another one of the top underappreciated stocks to buy and hold.\n\nThis is the company that provides voice control and audio analytics software to automakers, drive-through restaurants, and other businesses with phone-based menu systems.\n\nBetter, one of its biggest investors is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which invested about $3.7 million in the company. Even the investment arm of SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) invested $2.3 million in the stock. Those investments are on the small side, but it says a lot that industry giants are jumping into the underappreciated name.\n\nPlus, analysts at Wedbush just said SOUN’s latest earnings put its AI momentum “front and center.” The firm added that SOUN is “well-positioned” to capitalize on AI. It also has an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $9 a share.\n\nFrom its current price of $4.70, I’d like to see it initially retest $10.25 last seen in March.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Aristocrats in Disguise: 3 Blue-Chip Stocks With Stealth Growth Potential",
        "content": "Although there is no hard-and-fast rule about what constitutes a blue-chip stock, they all tend to have certain qualities. They are large, financially stable companies that have been through numerous business and economic cycles that proved their worth in the end.\n\nThe upper echelon of the S&P 500 are the sort of stocks that comprise blue-chip stocks. Yet investors need to be careful because “blue-chip” doesn’t always mean the same thing to everyone. The T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:TCHP), for example, includes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that are easily recognizable blue-chip stocks. Yet the exchange-traded fund (ETF) also includes some head-scratchers like Carvana (NASDAQ:CVNA).\n\nWhat follows are three blue-chip growth stocks that most investors would agree fit the definition and offer significant opportunities for substantial wealth creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough some might put Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) in the same category as Carvana, the ride-share leader is a solid, financially sound business that continues growing. Its brand is known globally and it’s name has become a verb for people wanting a ride somewhere, even when they are using competing services.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 15% to $10.3 billion as gross bookings surged 20% to 37.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rocketed 82% higher for the period, hitting nearly $1.4 billion as Uber generated almost $1.4 billion in free cash flow.\n\nHaving expanded beyond just simple ride-hailing services, Uber Technologies now also delivers food, groceries, packages and even freight. It is also investing heavily into driverless vehicles and the nascent electric vehicle takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft industry. The self-driving car initiative would dramatically boost revenue and profits as the company would no longer need to split fares with drivers.\n\nWith Uber Technologies stock down 22% from recent highs and earnings expected to grow 47% annually for the next five years, the ride-share leader is a blue-chip growth stock with a bright future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt doesn’t garner the kinds of headlines as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but chipmaker Marvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is carving out a new path for itself in artificial intelligence (AI). Best known as a maker of semiconductors for the fiber optics industry, the chipmaker is applying its electro-optical expertise to develop AI chips for data centers. For example,  Marvell’s Nova 1.6 terabytes per second PAM4 electro-optics platform — an industry first for speed — enables the high-speed movement of data in AI, machine learning (ML) and data center networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarvell is racking up wins with hyperscalers and recently announced its third hyperscale cloud customer for its custom chip business. Wall Street analysts think the chipmaker has already won over the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google as customers.  It shows how Marvell’s pivot to new verticals like data center infrastructure provides a new foundation for long-term growth. The data center industry is positioned for significant expansion and Marvell Technology will be riding the wave higher.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nDrugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) already caught its own wave of opportunity, as treatments for diabetes and obesity created a tsunami of epic proportions. Mounjaro and Zepbound use terzepatide as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist to treat the conditions. The response has been phenomenal.\n\nGlobal Mounjaro sales more than tripled to $1.8 billion in the first quarter following U.S. approval, while Zepbound drew in $517 million in sales in its first full quarter after approval. The twin therapies helped Eli Lilly raise its 2024 guidance by $2 billion to a range of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion.\n\nThe pharmaceutical stock also has a portfolio of existing treatments and a pipeline of drugs in clinical trials. Eli Lilly is also willing to buy what it needs to plug any holes. Last year it bought radiopharmaceutical company Point Biopharma for $1.4 billion and just announced it will invest $60 million into Atkis Oncology to gain access to its miniprotein platform to develop anticancer radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals are a new class of cancer drugs containing radioactive isotopes to deliver radiation therapy directly to cancer cells.\n\nEli Lilly struck gold with Mounjaro and Zepbound but that’s not the only place place the drugmaker is panning for riches.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Are you looking for some new high-growth stocks to add to your portfolio? You could start with the most obvious option at the moment: artificial intelligence (AI) players.\n\nDescribing AI as a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity doesn't seem like hyperbole anymore. Even without knowing exactly what the AI industry will look like just five years from now, it's quite clear at this point that it's going to live up to the hype. The chief challenge now is simply figuring out which companies are best positioned to benefit.\n\nThat brings me to three artificial intelligence stocks that aren't yet fully valued in light of their potential. Arguably, each of these three tickers could explode higher once more investors connect the dots.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nYou've most likely heard of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and you may have noticed that software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has melded its Bing search engine with an AI-powered conversational assistant called Copilot. You may have even tinkered with this tool, or with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) comparable chatbot, Gemini (formerly called Bard). There's no denying these tools are fun to play with, in addition to being legitimately helpful to many who use them.\n\nFrom a monetization perspective though, these platforms don't appear to have a great deal of commercial appeal. ChatGPT and Copilot, however, don't represent the best use cases for artificial intelligence technology. AI platforms purpose-built for business are proving far more marketable.\n\nEnter Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nAs a consumer, you will not have used its service. Companies like General Mills, the CBS television network, and Aramark are some of its newest clients, though, joining a growing number of enterprises using Palantir's offerings to help them do something constructive with the mountains of digitized data they've been gathering for years. The company's software is also being used by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, energy company ExxonMobil, and drugmaker Sanofi, just to name a few. There has simply not been a data-analysis option powerful enough to pay for ... until now.\n\nPalantir Technologies has only scratched the surface of its potential, though. Analysts expect its top line to grow to the tune of 21% this year and then repeat the feat next year. CEO Alex Karp's only complaint is that the company can't keep up with demand.\n\nShares are performing well, by the way. They're up more than 50% for the past year, and higher by more than 130% for the past couple of years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's reason to expect Palantir stock could catapult higher, however, given the company's profitability as well as the fact that it's already a market leader in its niche. Technology market research outfits Gartner and Forrester Research both consistently rank it as one of the top names of the AI data-analysis space, comparing it to much bigger players like Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nMost everyone understands Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) hardware sits at the heart of most artificial intelligence data centers. Analysts with Mizuho Securities suggest it controls about 90% of the AI-processor market.\n\nThose graphics processing units (GPUs) and similar powerful processors are only one piece of the technological puzzle which is an AI data center. Artificial intelligence servers are actually massive banks of individual computers that must be built around a processor and then tethered together on a giant rack (or racks). Some company has to manufacture these computers and then assemble the towers they become a part of.\n\nThat's what Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) does. Whether a customer prefers Nvidia's tech or Intel's, and whether that client wants to use Amazon's cloud computing service or Microsoft's, Super Micro Computer can deliver.\n\nAnd it's been delivering like crazy. Last quarter's top line was up an incredible 200% year over year, extending a well-established growth trend that's expected to last well into the future. Analysts are calling for revenue growth of 60% in its next fiscal year. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThat's just the beginning. Precedence Research forecasts that the AI infrastructure market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 27% through 2033 as more and more organizations rush to build the AI platforms they're increasingly realizing they'll need if they want to remain competitive.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's stock price has drifted sideways after peeling back from March's peak. It's most likely just taking a breather though, ahead of its next leg higher.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nLast but not least, add Alphabet to your list of AI stocks that could go parabolic in the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's a well-respected tech name, but some might find it tough to see the Google parent as an AI play. Although its Gemini/Bard chatbot is a clever use of AI tech, there aren't a great deal of practical commercial applications for it. Besides, the company's core business is advertising. Adding an AI profit center to the mix could be quite an undertaking.\n\nAlphabet is taking the task on, however, and is better positioned to make it worth the effort than you might think.\n\nSee, Alphabet isn't aimlessly building an AI business from scratch just for the sake of seeing what happens. It's using artificial intelligence as a means of making its existing advertising business even better. Just last week, the company announced it will soon allow advertisers to use AI-generated ads, for instance. The company also says ads will soon begin appearing within its new AI Overviews, which are a separate category of search results for anyone using the Google search engine. Of course, more meaningful data about Google's users helps advertisers as well as Alphabet.\n\nWhat could really sustain and even accelerate the stock's current advance, however, is renewed optimism from the analyst community. Bank of America analyst Justin Post recently reiterated his buy rating on Alphabet stock, citing the latest advancements in its AI advertising tech. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan said the same.\n\nBoth recognize that advertising is and will remain Alphabet's big breadwinner into the distant future. Its foray into artificial intelligence is complementary to this business, though, without conflicting with it. Investors may be underestimating the degree of revenue growth that's in store here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The 2 Best Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "The revival of stock splits has been one of the more noteworthy market trends in recent years. Companies generally embark on this course of action after years of consistently strong business and financial performance have driven the share price into the stratosphere. While a stock split doesn't change the intrinsic value of the company, it does make shares more affordable for employees and the general public, a reason that is frequently cited by companies as the primary reason behind the split.\n\nHowever, investors should look to the robust underlying results that led to a stock split in the first place because consistently strong business performance is the best reason to own a stock.\n\nIt stands to reason, then, that companies that have recently announced or conducted stock splits are fertile ground for future gains. Let's take a look at two companies that are ripe for the picking. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been making headlines over the past year or so, and it's easy to understand why. Recent developments in the field, namely generative AI, can simplify a number of routine tasks, helping make workers more productive. Imagine systems that can prioritize emails and draft responses, quickly find and summarize documents related to a particular topic, and generate presentations from available data -- all from a few simple prompts.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) that underpin this revolutionary technology. As such, when the AI revolution kicked off early last year, it drove demand for Nvidia's processors to record heights, and it shows no signs of slowing.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit year-over-year sales and profit gains. Record quarterly revenue of $26 billion soared 262% year over year, driving earnings per share (EPS) to $5.98, an increase of 629%. Management expects Nvidia's growth spurt to continue, calling for second-quarter revenue of $28 billion, up 107%.\n\nLest there be any doubt, it's the accelerating adoption of generative AI that's driving the results. Nvidia's data center segment, which includes cloud computing and AI processors, hit record sales of $22.6 billion, up 427%.\n\nWith the stock up 3,000% over the past five years, management announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will take place in June. Nvidia also increased its dividend by 150% to $0.01 on a post-split basis. With a yield of 0.04%, it's certainly nothing to write home about, but it forms the foundation for meaningful increases in the future, especially since it boasts a payout ratio of less than 3% of profits.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nIt takes an extraordinary business to continue its growth during the worst period of economic contraction in more than a decade, but Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) did just that. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds of the past few years, the company grew comparable store sales (or \"comps\") in each and every quarter going back to the start of 2022. That's a testament to the strong demand for Chipotle's \"food with integrity.\"\n\nThe company kicked off the year in style, with revenue growing 14% year over year to $2.7 billion, while diluted EPS of $13.01 surged 24%. Comps continued to shine, increasing by 7%, driven by increased customer visits and Chipotle's unmatched pricing power. Perhaps as importantly, restaurant-level operating margins continued their unrelenting trek higher to 27.5%, up from 25.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nFurther fueling its robust growth is the company's wildly successful digital strategy, as Chipotle's rewards program surpassed 40 million members earlier this year. Another big drive is the company's Chipotlanes, the dedicated drive-thru just for mobile orders. Management notes that locations with Chipotlanes generate higher sales and increase profit margins. As a result, digital orders are growing faster than overall sales and represented 37% of total food and beverage revenue in the first quarter.\n\nChipotle stock hit a new all-time high earlier this month. With gains of 375% over the past five years, management announced a 50-for-1 stock split, which will take place in June. Management called it \"one of the biggest stock splits in New York Stock Exchange history.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Software Sales Could Soar 6,260% by 2032. 1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Does (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has spread like wildfire since early last year, and the benefits are clear. These generative AI algorithms take AI to the next level, creating original text, images, and video from a few simple prompts. As a result, users can simplify mundane and time-consuming tasks and increase productivity. As the old adage states, \"Time is money,\" so businesses are eager to adopt these next-generation systems.\n\nThere's little argument that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has reaped the early rewards of this paradigm shift as the leading provider of the processors and other hardware used to facilitate AI. This led to four consecutive quarters of triple-digit year over year revenue and profit growth, a dividend boost, and an upcoming 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nHowever, the market is forward-looking, and investors are already beginning to anticipate the coming wave of AI software adoption. Generative AI software sales are expected to surge 6,260% to $318 billion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIt's clear that Nvidia will continue to profit from its gold-standard AI processors, but there's another company that's poised to profit from the adoption of AI software. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNot your grandfather's Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) rose to prominence by creating its industry-standard Windows computer operating system and Office suite of work productivity software. The company continues to make its mark with its Teams workplace collaboration platform and Azure Cloud. But arguably, the biggest opportunity will come from the proliferation of AI.\n\nWhile many companies have been jumping on the AI bandwagon, Microsoft was among the first to recognize the transformative potential of generative AI. The company first invested in ChatGPT creator OpenAI back in 2019, boosting its stake to $13 billion early last year. This gave Microsoft the inside track to integrate these advanced algorithms into many of its flagship products and services.\n\nPerhaps the most important development has been the creation of Microsoft Copilot, the company's growing roster of AI-powered digital helpers, which form the backbone of Microsoft's AI strategy. The most prominent is Copilot for Microsoft 365, which is deeply integrated into its Office products. The company also developed additional Copilots specific to sales, service, and finance positions, charging customers $30 per user per month, and uptake has been strong. While management hasn't released detailed figures regarding adoption, some analysts posit that Copilot could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue annually. That's not all. Microsoft recently unveiled a line of Copilot+ PCs, with the company's AI-powered digital assistant built in.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure provider, Microsoft is well positioned to offer AI services to its clients. This, in turn, is attracting new users to its cloud offerings, helping Microsoft gain market share on its cloud rivals. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Azure Cloud climbed 31% year over year, faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which grew 17% and 28%, respectively. Management noted that AI \"contributed seven points\" to Azure's growth.\n\nIn fact, in the calendar first quarter, Microsoft accounted for 25% of worldwide cloud infrastructure spending, compared to 31% for AWS and 10% for Google Cloud. If Microsoft continues to gain ground, there could soon be a changing of the guard among the cloud leaders.\n\nThe evidence is clear\n\nTaking a step back shows that Microsoft continues to generate strong results overall. Third-quarter revenue grew 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, while diluted earnings per share jumped 20% to $2.94. Not bad for the world's largest company by market cap, at nearly $3.19 trillion (as of this writing).\n\nDespite the company's foundational place in the AI software revolution, Microsoft stock is currently selling for 36 times forward earnings, an attractive price relative to the opportunity.\n\nGenerative AI is already sweeping the business world, but it's still in the early stages of adoption. Microsoft's strategy of developing a suite of AI-powered Copilots was sheer brilliance, positioning the company to profit from the continued adoption of AI. That's why Microsoft is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SONY, UBER, CDNS: Which Strong-Buy-Rated Tech Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "Stock markets are on a bit of a pause following concerns that the Federal Reserve may not be ready to cut interest rates until September. Undoubtedly, the odds of a June cut were pretty low to begin with. Either way, a “higher for slightly longer” kind of environment may take a slight stride out of the market’s march higher, even with the artificial intelligence (AI) boom still very much in full swing.\n\nAs the market rally slows pace, the following high-rated tech stocks may be worth loading up on. Therefore, in this piece, we’ll look at three very different technology companies using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool. Each one of the names has a Strong Buy recommendation, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nSony (NYSE:SONY)\n\nSony is a Japanese entertainment company that offers a unique and diversified mix of businesses, ranging from film production to music and video games to electronics. The stock was a major mover going into and after its latest earnings, which came in ahead of analyst expectations. Though not all segments may find themselves firing on all cylinders at the same time, the company remains diversified (and cheap) enough to make it a worthy bet right here. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on SONY stock at just over $80 per share.\n\nFor the latest (fourth) quarter, the entertainment giant reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.99, topping expectations of $0.69. Most remarkably, the Music, Pictures, and Imaging & Sensing Solutions segments all saw impressive double-digit growth for the quarter. Meanwhile, Game & Network Services (G&NS) saw low growth, up 2.2% for the quarter, thanks in part to falling shipments for the PlayStation 5 (PS5).\n\nThe PS5 is a great console but been experiencing a bit of a midlife crisis of late. Indeed, the top-selling console is a major needle mover, not just for the gaming business but the overall firm.\n\nAs the firm readies a Pro model with a new GPU, perhaps the gaming division will finally get the shot in the arm it needs before the PS6 rolls around. The console is rumored to include better ray tracing and AI upscaling, the latter of which could be a literal game changer. Of all the industries AI could propel into the future, gaming has to be close to the top of the list.\n\nThough not truly the PS6, I do view the PS5 Pro as the next best thing to a generational refresh. Whether it kicks off a midcycle refresh remains the big question. Either way, developers are gearing up for the upgrades, which could result in a steady and stacked pipeline of truly next-generation-feeling titles.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the dominant gaming business and the wide-moat film, music, and electronics businesses, I view Sony stock as a fantastic deal at 15.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) now that shares have come down a bit after their big 10% post-earnings pop.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for SONY Stock?\n\nSONY stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with four unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average SONY stock price target of $112.93 implies 39.8% upside potential.\n\nUber (NASDAQ:UBER)\n\nUber stock’s bull run of 2023-24 is now officially over, with shares of the ride-hailing giant now down 22% from their all-time highs. The multi-month fall has been a rather steady descent on the back of some fantastic second-quarter earnings results. Undoubtedly, the hot valuation was in need of a cool-off, but now that shares have chilled out in a bear market, I view them as a great pick-up ahead of the summer travel season. I’m staying bullish on the stock as the bearish descent extends.\n\nAs the travel season heats up, Uber seems to be gearing up to save its customers some money with its shuttle-booking service. Such a service could not have come at a better time. Consumers are a bit strapped for cash amid inflation, and Uber continues to demonstrate the tremendous value proposition of its mobility services. Additionally, the firm’s recent Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) partnership to help power its restaurant delivery capabilities could open Uber’s doors to new customers who may be enticed to give Uber’s app a go as well.\n\nAdd the Uber One subscription, which offers discounts on mobility and food delivery services, plus an expansion to 25 new countries into the equation, and it’s clear that it’s too soon to depart Uber stock while it’s going for a modest 51 times forward P/E, close to the lowest it’s been in the past year.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for UBER Stock?\n\nUBER stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 31 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average UBER stock price target of $88.03 implies 37.3% upside potential.\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS)\n\nCadence Design Systems is picking up speed again after suffering a 15% correction back in April. As the AI boom heats up again, thanks in part to continued explosive demand for AI accelerators, Cadence is one of the high-performing AI plays to watch as it inches back to all-time highs again. Today, the stock is off just 12% from its high, a level that could be breached should Cadence be able to pass an earnings bar that it lowered just over a month ago. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on CDNS stock.\n\nLooking ahead, I’d look for the new Palladium Z3 and Protium X3 systems to jolt growth in the second half of the year. These new products aim to “usher in a new era of accelerated verification, software development, and digital twins.” When you hear “digital twins,” think of the AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), whose technology is integral to powering these sophisticated models.\n\nIn recent quarters, Cadence has formed a closer relationship with Nvidia. The two forces will be ready to launch the Millennium M1 supercomputer, which is every bit as impressive as it sounds. The supercomputer will tackle very difficult problems in science and engineering, providing up to 100x design impact through accuracy, speed, and scale and a 10x increase in throughput compared to CPU-only solutions.\n\nThe stock trades at 49.5 times forward P/E, which is well above the application software industry average of over 30.9 times. Still, I think the premium is well worth paying because of the Z3, X3, and M1 (not to be confused with the first generation of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) silicon).\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for CDNS Stock?\n\nCDNS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average CDNS stock price target of $335.71 implies 16.5% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThere you have it — three analyst-praised technology companies that still have room to boom in the second half of the year. Sony, an entertainment kingpin that’s expanded its reach across numerous media, is objectively the cheapest based on P/E ratios alone. Personally, I view it as the best bet. For those seeking greater growth, though, CDNS stock is tough to beat, given innovations that could move the needle in the coming year. At writing, analysts see the most upside to be had from SONY stock (~40%).\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

NVIDIA's GPUs are not just hardware; they are part of a broader ecosystem that includes CUDA, a software platform for AI development, which further entrenches its market position.\n\nFinancial Performance: NVIDIA's financial health is a testament to its operational success. With a net income of $14.881 billion and a gross profit margin of 78.4%, the company demonstrates strong profitability and cost management. These financial metrics not only reflect NVIDIA's ability to capitalize on market opportunities but also its resilience in navigating industry challenges.\n\nProduct Diversification: NVIDIA's strategic expansion into various markets has diversified its revenue streams. The Compute & Networking segment, which includes data center solutions and AI applications, has seen a 427% increase in revenue, underscoring the successful adoption of NVIDIA's technologies in high-growth areas. This diversification reduces reliance on any single market and positions NVIDIA for sustained growth.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSupply Chain Complexity: NVIDIA's intricate supply chain, involving multiple suppliers and global manufacturing, presents execution risks. The company's reliance on third-party manufacturers and assembly partners, primarily located outside the United States, exposes it to potential disruptions from geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or pandemics. Managing this complexity is crucial to maintaining product availability and customer satisfaction.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Concentration Risks: While NVIDIA has diversified its product offerings, it still faces concentration risks. A significant portion of its revenue comes from a limited number of customers and partners. For instance, two direct customers accounted for 24% of total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Losing any of these key customers or changes in their purchasing patterns could adversely impact NVIDIA's financial performance.\n\nGeopolitical Tensions: NVIDIA's operations and revenue are susceptible to international political dynamics, particularly involving Taiwan and China, where a significant portion of its revenue is generated and where critical supply chain partners are located. Geopolitical tensions in these regions could disrupt NVIDIA's operations and adversely affect its business.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAI and Deep Learning Expansion: NVIDIA's expertise in AI and deep learning presents significant growth opportunities. The company's GPUs are increasingly used for training and inferencing with large language models and generative AI applications, as evidenced by the 478% growth in Compute GPU revenue. NVIDIA's continued innovation in this space can drive further adoption and open new markets.\n\nEmerging Technologies: NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and the metaverse. Its platforms are already being used by electric vehicle makers and in AI Cockpit solutions. NVIDIA's early investments in these areas could yield substantial returns as these technologies mature and become more widespread.\n\nGlobal Market Expansion: With 48% of its revenue from international sales, NVIDIA has ample room to grow its global footprint. Expanding into new geographic markets and strengthening its presence in existing ones can drive further revenue growth and reduce the impact of regional market fluctuations.\n\nThreats\n\nSupply Chain Disruptions: NVIDIA's reliance on a global supply chain makes it vulnerable to disruptions from various sources, including pandemics, natural disasters, and political unrest. These disruptions can lead to extended lead times and supply constraints, impacting the company's ability to meet customer demand and maintain its market position.\n\nCompetitive Pressure: The GPU and AI markets are highly competitive, with several established players and new entrants vying for market share. NVIDIA must continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to stay ahead of competitors, which include other tech giants and specialized AI companies.\n\nRegulatory and Policy Changes: Changes in government policies, particularly concerning trade and technology exports, can pose significant threats to NVIDIA. For example, the company has not received licenses to ship restricted products to China, a key market. Such regulatory challenges can limit NVIDIA's market access and affect its revenue.\n\nIn conclusion, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) demonstrates a robust financial and strategic position, with significant strengths in market leadership, innovation, and financial performance. However, it must navigate weaknesses such as supply chain complexity and market concentration risks. Opportunities in AI, emerging technologies, and global expansion are promising, while threats from supply chain disruptions, competitive pressure, and regulatory changes require vigilant management. Overall, NVIDIA's strategic initiatives and market foresight position it well to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Founder Leads Parade of CEOs to Summit on Future of AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s Jensen Huang will lead a gathering of tech business leaders in Taipei starting Sunday, an unusual opportunity for the industry’s most important executives to come together and figure out the future of computing and AI.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Becomes First Former US President Guilty of Crimes South Africa Election Results With 29% Voting Districts In World’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid Trump Is Guilty on All Counts in Hush-Money Case. Now What?\n\nFrom Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Qualcomm Inc.’s Cristiano Amon, the biggest names in PC and chipmaking are joining Huang at Computex 2024 to exhibit the progress they’ve made in laying the foundation for technologies from ChatGPT-like AI to future smart devices. Those CEOs will make the case for their own products but also huddle in a search for answers to the most pressing issues facing the global tech sector, from geopolitical ructions and conflict to constrained supply of essential components such as high-bandwidth memory.\n\nUppermost on their minds is how to harness AI and ready their businesses for the coming change. Qualcomm’s betting on a partnership with Microsoft Corp. around new AI PCs that’ll bring its pedigree of smartphone processors to laptops. Pat Gelsinger of Intel Corp. and Arm Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas will present their contrasting visions for the future of computing, while Tainan-born Huang will be asked how Nvidia plans to respond to Qualcomm’s new venture.\n\n“This is a massive inflection, it is the biggest moment in the PC business in decades,” said Dan Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group. “AI is the hottest trend with the longest trail, it’s the earliest innings, and they’re all fighting.”\n\nTaipei is a fitting location for hashing out those important questions. Its importance in the chip supply chain has never been greater, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fabricating Apple Inc.’s iPhone chips, Nvidia’s must-have AI accelerators, AMD’s competing products and a good chunk of the Arm chips powering the global mobile market. The path to AI breakthroughs is paved with semiconductors and servers, many of which are made or assembled in Taiwan.\n\nIt’s also home to a coterie of lesser-known players that provide the building blocks for Nvidia’s products. The US company secured a seemingly unassailable lead in AI data centers, with the help of relationships Huang has cultivated with Taiwan’s server makers like Quanta Computer Inc. and, increasingly, Hon Hai Precision Technology Co. His last visit to the island was a marketing tour de force, as he lauded those firms and touted the trillion-dollar opportunity in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI servers will become a NT$1 trillion ($31 billion) revenue product at Hon Hai as soon as next year, its Chairman Young Liu said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Friday.\n\n“Last year was already hot because of AI. And this year is explosive because AI is accelerating,” said James C. F. Huang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), which runs Computex. “We are like a big magnet.”\n\nRead more: Taiwan Stands Out as Asia’s AI Canary\n\nAt a media event during last year’s Computex, Nvidia’s Huang presented an array of AI hardware from the company — from H100 AI chips to integrated server rack modules and proprietary technologies to help multiple components work like one unified computer. When asked if all those parts were made in Taiwan, Huang said that they were. Taiwan’s dominance has much to do with the fact that neither Intel nor Samsung Electronics Co. have matched TSMC’s technology leadership and manufacturing reliability.\n\nThat preeminence in the chipmaking and computing spheres is also a source of growing concern for governments, which are wary of the threat of China, which claims the island as part of its territory, taking it over by force. US firms have been asking Taiwanese partners to diversify the geography of their operations, to guard against a potential invasion from the mainland.\n\nTAITRA’s Huang said that from chips to motherboards to server assemblers, the AI hardware supply chain all comes together in Taiwan, making it an efficient one-stop shop for big tech firms like Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Meta Platforms Inc. to buy their hardware.\n\n“AI Semiconductors and AI servers will prop up Taiwan’s economy for another 50 years,” Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo said. “Taiwanese firms also make 80% to 90% of all the AI servers in the world.”\n\nQualcomm may play the role of disruptor at Computex this year, as its Snapdragon chips will feature heavily in the most promoted product at the show: Microsoft’s new breed of Copilot+ PCs. These so-called AI PCs will feature Microsoft’s latest and best collection of AI features — such as Recall, which keeps a searchable visual history of everything a user does — and rely on Qualcomm silicon, to the exclusion of Intel and AMD. Everyone from Asustek Computer Inc. to Lenovo Group Ltd. and Dell Technologies Inc. will have such wares to show.\n\nRead more: Qualcomm Bets on AI to Knock Intel From PC Perch: Tech Daily\n\nOne key consideration for all the big firms is that “the first choice customers make tends to stick,” Newman said. So if enterprise customers opt to upgrade to a Qualcomm-based AI computer lineup, they’re likely to keep that going forward, and the chip firms are sending their CEOs to Computex because “they want to make sure they cement their place in this particular moment.”\n\nOn the sidelines of the event, the likes of Su and Gelsinger will also be working to grab a share of the limited resources required for producing their AI products. SK Hynix Inc., the early leader in providing essential high-bandwidth memory for such processors, has sold most of its AI chip capacity through 2025. And TSMC’s output of AI semiconductors faces a bottleneck in how quickly it can do the advanced chip packaging required.\n\n“Everybody’s fighting for capacity right now,” Newman said. “Data center chips, PC chips, automotive chips, there’s only so much fabrication, substrates and silicon wafers.”\n\n(Updates with comments from minister, analyst and Hon Hai chairman)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo’s Race to Boost Supplies Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Institutional investors represent the so-called big money that wields significant influence over the stock market. That influence manifests in many ways.\n\nA negative view of institutional investors is that they only care about themselves, not smaller retail investors, and they simply have too much control overall. A more positive take is that institutional investors, with their long-term outlook and focus on stability, tend to stabilize stock prices.\n\nRegardless, it’s fair to state that following institutional investors is often a strong strategy. Institutions have the ability to pool resources and buy large blocks of securities. That has a significant impact on price, for one. Further, institutional investors tend to have greater experience and more detailed knowledge of market constituents. That wealth of experience often leads to better outcomes and stronger returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat’s why paying attention to the institutional bets big money is making in the stock market this year is a wise strategy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhether measured by value or number of positions opened this year, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has significant institutional interest.\n\nBy March of 2024, the total value of institutional ownership in Meta Platforms stood at nearly $722 billion. That made it the 6th most held investment by institutions on a sheer dollar value basis. A total of 808 institutional investors opened a position in Meta Platforms in March. During that. institutional investors only opened more positions in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt shouldn’t be surprising that META stock has surged in 2024. Year to date, it is up by more than 32%. Meta Platforms revenues skyrocketed by 27% in the first quarter. Meanwhile, net income more than doubled, growing by 117% during the same period.\n\nThe company has made serious progress with its Llama 3 AI. It clearly has aspirations to be among the most important AI firms overall. Beyond that, Meta’s ad impression and ad pricing metrics are each rising impressively. That’s a testament to the resurgent ad revenue that dominates the company’s overall business.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nInstitutional investors held nearly $430 billion worth of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock at the end of March. Only eight firms were more widely held by institutions at that point. It’s certainly a strong indication of how important and well-regarded the firm is. The company remains one of the most important semiconductor design, software and chip infrastructure companies on Earth.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think one of the most important aspects to understand here in relation to the institutional ownership of Broadcom is the stability inherent in it as an investment. First of all, institutional investors tend to make long-term investments, which lends stability to those stocks, given the sheer volume of resources they can place therein. Institutional investors have only placed more resources in eight other firms in 2024. That inherently makes AVGO shares stable.\n\nBroadcom is stable as an investment otherwise. The company provides a dividend, which is a sign of stability. It last reduced that dividend in 2011 and has a healthy payout ratio.\n\nLithium Americas (Argentina) (LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (Argentina) (NYSE:LAAC) is among the more interesting stocks on this list simply because it is somewhat unexpected. A lot of the firms Wall Street is betting on are very large and well-known. They generally do not surprise and include many names from the Magnificent Seven and a select few others.\n\nLithium Americas (Argentina) is an interesting choice because there has been such a sharp increase in Wall Street’s attention to the company. Institutional ownership increased by more than 1,700% in March.\n\nRemember, this is not the Lithium Americas stock that holds rights to the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. It is the other half of the company, which was earlier divided to isolate Thacker Pass for its outsized potential.\n\nIt’s also a company that is currently producing lithium. The company produced 4,500 tons of lithium during the fourth quarter and is on track to produce as much as 40,000 tons in all of 2024.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock continues to be volatile and difficult to pin down for investors big and small.\n\nCEO Bob Iger has made significant strides toward driving profitability from the company’s streaming segment. The company focused on aggressive cost-cutting and was seen by some as a sign of potential stagnation. Those detractors believed the efforts signaled a lack of viable growth targets and overall growth potential. Whether those detractors are right or wrong remains to be seen. However, the stock has fallen since then.\n\nYet, Walt Disney shares have still grown by 12% in 2024. And the streaming segment did prove profitable in the first quarter. Disney is focused on quality. That will manifest as a decreased focus on Marvel films, in particular.\n\nI believe the company is making strides to return to its former glory. Yes, Disney did miss important guidance metrics, but the big shift toward quality over quantity matters.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

Whether it’s total value, number of positions opened, holdings by number of filers or percentage increase in shares held, Nvidia stock is among the top five.\n\nFollowing another quarter of strong earnings those institutional investors are upping their bets on Nvidia, even as it pushes past the $1,000 per share mark. TD Cowen just upped its target price on Nvidia to $1,200.\n\nEven that $1,200 target price could be low, given that Nvidia just posted its highest-ever quarterly profits and sales figures. In fact, other analysts already assigned higher target prices to Nvidia even before this most recent earnings blowout.\n\nAnyway, retail investors should expect their institutional counterparts to up their respective bets on Nvidia following this most recent news. Investors big and small have plenty of reason to remain highly optimistic about Nvidia at this point.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is another stock in which many institutional owners have recently opened positions. The company itself is in an interesting position, given its competitor status to Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s strong earnings report sent AMD shares lower. The reasoning behind the slide is that Nvidia is so strong that AMD has little chance of making headway at the moment — at least, that’s how I make sense of the 3% price drop in AMD.\n\nI also think it’s an overreaction. Powerful forces in the computing world will again consider AMD because it offers strong computing power at a lower price than Nvidia. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is chief among those firms to watch in relation to that narrative. It is leveraging AMD’s MI300x chips heavily.\n\nAMD can bask in that role while continuing to improve its chips in the hope that it can one day outperform those from Nvidia. It’s a decent position to be in from the perspective that the company doesn’t face the substantial pricing pressure that Nvidia does.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nUnsurprisingly, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is among the stocks that Wall Street and Main Street continue to bet on in 2024. The already strong stock will likely continue to strengthen. Mounjaro and Zepbound have proven to be incredible drivers of growth for the company in 2024.\n\nFirst quarter revenues jumped by 26% on the strength of those weight loss drugs. Eli Lilly has an excellent opportunity to establish its place among the most valuable stocks through the rest of the decade. Simply put, it has won the early rounds of the weight loss drug wars. First-quarter sales were well above levels anticipated on Wall Street. That prompted Eli Lilly to raise its 2024 sales forecast. Zepbound and Mounjaro will likely fulfill their promise as blockbuster drugs that rewrite sales figures in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly continues to progress toward a once-weekly insulin injection. Demand for such an injection will likely be very strong, given that it would replace the once-daily injections required now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Many computer hardware makers are getting big boosts from the proliferation of artificial intelligence. Of course, a huge number of computer chips are needed to create and maintain artificial intelligence (AI). Data centers are playing a huge role in creating and disseminating AI, so many of the leading makers of equipment for data centers are likely to thrive going forward. Also on the AI front, the demand for AI PCs is likely to be strong going forward, creating opportunities for a high number of additional computer hardware makers.\n\nIn a different but related area, robots — thanks to AI — appear to be nearly set to finally enter consumer homes on a major scale, creating great opportunities for a large number of computer hardware stocks. Here are the three best companies in the space for investors who want to exploit these strong trends.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, “Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) sells datacenter hardware, such as switches, routing products and VPNs.” The firm is also poised to gain ground in the $45 billion Ethernet switches market. That’s because Arista’s switches can interface with the most advanced chips more efficiently than Cisco‘s (NASDAQ:CSCO) switches. In 2023, Cisco had a 40% share of the Ethernet switches market versus Arista’s 10% allotment. Arista also offers network equipment that can be used to support AI PCs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe hardware maker reported very impressive fiscal first-quarter financial results on May 6. They indicate these strong, positive catalysts are significantly boosting Arista’s top and bottom lines. Specifically, earnings per share (EPS) soared 39% to $1.99 compared to the year earlier. Sales also advanced 16% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Analysts, on average, had only expected the firm to generate EPS of $1.74. Also encouragingly, the firm announced a new $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan.\n\nIn recent weeks, ANET stock enjoyed strong momentum as the shares jumped 28% between Apr. 22 and May 29.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) specializes in making servers that work in conjunction with the products of all of the leading makers of AI chips, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nMultiple major Wall Street banks have been very bullish on SMCI stock recently. Bank of America noted Nvidia said many consumer-facing companies and other types of firms were embracing AI for the first time. The bank expects Super Micro to significantly benefit from this strong trend. Bank of America also noted Super Micro already has footholds with companies in multiple sectors, including “financial services, drug discovery and autonomous vehicles.” And Super Micro is holding talks with governments about supporting their forays into AI. Bank of America maintained its “buy” rating and its $1,090 price target on SMCI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter speaking with Super Micro’s CFO, JPMorgan said the tech firm has a “strong (and record) backlog.” The bank expects the company to benefit from price hikes and increased revenue as it upgrades its servers.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nIndustrial automation firm Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) develops “integrated robot solutions” and specializes in providing industrial robots. Already becoming a huge business, industrial robots are slated to become much more popular in the medium-to-long term amid continued AI advancements.\n\nA record total of over 44,300 robots were shipped to American manufacturers last year. In addition to AI improvements, labor shortages and higher speed and efficiency requirements will drive higher adoption of robots in the longer term, Association for Advancing Automation president Jeff Burnstein told Investor’s Business Daily.\n\nIn September 2023, Rockwell acquired Canada-based Clearpath Robotics, which Rockwell described as “a leader in autonomous robotics for industrial applications.” The deal should help Rockwell meet the increasing demand for high-speed robots in the manufacturing sector.\n\nAnd Rockwell could even eventually branch out to providing robots for consumer homes. According to Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, technology is getting advanced and cheap enough that robots will soon become useful additions to homes. Indeed, Tesla is considering selling its robot, Optimus, to consumers at the end of 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SMCI, ANET and INTC.

        "title": "US Is Reining In AI Chip Sales to Middle East by Nvidia, AMD",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US officials have slowed the issuing of licenses to chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. for large-scale AI accelerator shipments to the Middle East, according to people familiar with the matter, while officials conduct a national security review of AI development in the region.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar South Africa Election Results With 29% Voting Districts In ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid\n\nIt’s unclear how long the review will take, nor is there a concrete definition of what constitutes a large shipment, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Officials are particularly focused on high-volume sales, the people said, as countries including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia look to import massive quantities of the chips used in AI data centers.\n\nAI accelerators — a category pioneered by Nvidia — help data centers process the flood of information needed to develop artificial intelligence chatbots and other tools. They’ve become essential equipment for companies and governments seeking to build an AI infrastructure.\n\nThe slowdown in exports is meant to give Washington time to develop a comprehensive strategy around how the advanced chips will be deployed overseas, according to the people. That includes negotiating who manages and secures the facilities used to train AI models, some of the people said.\n\nShares of Nvidia slipped to a session low after Bloomberg reported on the move. The stock declined as much as 3.1% to $1,113 in New York. AMD, meanwhile, pared earlier gains. It was up less than 1% to $166.45.\n\nIn a statement, the Commerce Department said its highest priority was “protecting national security.”\n\n“With regards to the most cutting edge technologies, we conduct extensive due diligence through an interagency process, thoroughly reviewing license applications from applicants who intend to ship these advanced technologies around the world,” a representative for the department said. “As always, we remain committed to working with our partners in the Middle East and around the world to safeguard our technological ecosystem.”\n\nThea Kendler, who leads export administration at the Commerce Department, visited the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait earlier this month as part of those ongoing discussions. In the UAE, she indicated that there was progress in collaboration on semiconductor export controls, another person familiar with the matter said.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of the concern is that Chinese companies, which are largely cut off from cutting-edge American technology themselves, could access those chips through data centers in the Middle East. The Biden administration has been waging a broader campaign to keep advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment out of China’s hands, for fear that the technology will be used to bolster its military.\n\nUS officials have delayed or not responded to license applications submitted in the past several weeks, some of the people said. That includes attempts to sell to customers in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to one of the people. In addition to Nvidia and AMD, Intel Corp. and startup Cerebras Systems Inc. also make accelerator chips. The four companies declined to comment.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia have been jockeying for regional leadership in AI, aiming to reduce their economies’ dependence on oil. Both countries see the US as a key partner in that effort, and top officials and companies have said they’ll fulfill US requests to keep Chinese supply chains separate — or divest from Chinese technology entirely.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia just forged a deal with China’s Lenovo Group Ltd. that involves the computer maker building a research and development center in Riyadh.\n\nRead More: Lenovo Forges Saudi Pact With $2 Billion Convertibles Issue\n\nIn October, the Commerce Department added much of the Middle East to chip export restrictions that originally focused on China and a handful of other foreign adversaries. That meant companies needed a special US government license to ship cutting-edge semiconductors and chipmaking tools to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nThe ability to secure those licenses is a major part of negotiations surrounding Microsoft Corp.’s $1.5 billion investment in Abu Dhabi AI firm G42 — a partnership that followed months of talks with US officials.\n\n--With assistance from Nick Wadhams.\n\n(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo's Race to Boost Supplies Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

According to the latest report from Goldman Sach’s prime brokerage, Magnificent 7 companies account for about 20.7% of hedge funds’ total U.S. single stock net exposure. This represents the highest level on the record and exceeds the previous peak level of 20% seen last summer.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA alone has added about $470 billion in market capitalization since it released results on May 22 (read: Can NVIDIA's AI Chip Dominance Continue?).\r\n\r\nFurther, the Magnificent 7 hit 31% weighting in the S&P 500.\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nInvestors seeking to tap the hedge fund’s activity could consider ETFs having the largest exposure to Magnificent 7.\r\n\r\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)\r\n\r\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is the first-ever ETF offering investors equal-weight exposure to the “Magnificent Seven” stocks.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Nvidia is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor Nvidia, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Nvidia\n\nFor the fiscal year ending January 2025, this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to earn $25.10 per share, which is a change of 93.7% from the year-ago reported number.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Nvidia. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of Nvidia to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Growth Stock Gold Rush: 3 Picks Destined to Strike It Rich",
        "content": "Growth stocks are a great way to buy into a potential market bull run this year, should the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts occur. The Fed has hinted that rates could go down up to three times in 2024 from 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest in 22 years. The markets are now looking to the next Fed meeting in June for more updates.\n\nIf the Fed does what is expected and earnings keep going up without the economy going into a slump, the stock market could have a broad-based bull market. Fourteen of the 20 biggest stock markets in the world have already notched record highs this year, with U.S. stocks currently on a $12 trillion rise.\n\nSo far, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are leading the charge. After slowing down in 2023, Fidelity thinks earnings growth will pick up again in 2024, helping sustain the bull market with more inclusive stock market gains across sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEveryone is buying NVDA stock, but as we shall see, there are solid growth stocks rated a “strong buy,” have double-digit upsides, and have strong sales growth that are up for grabs. These growth stocks include a top e-commerce play with dominant cloud infrastructure, a cybersecurity firm with advanced security solutions, and an ambitious electric vehicle maker rapidly expanding its model line despite financial instability.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit a new record high in May, attributable to Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy’s confidence in Amazon’s abilities in generative AI and good Q1 earnings.\n\nThe upgraded Amazon Q now allows non-developers to build applications using natural language. AMZN also plans to add creative AI technologies to Alexa and charge a monthly subscription. At the same time, AWS Bedrock AI can now import and access custom AI models.\n\nIt’s important that Amazon keep adding to AWS, which accounts for 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market and has a $100 billion annual revenue run rate, more than any other cloud provider. AWS generated 54% of Amazon’s $13.21 billion operational profits in Q4 2023, representing 14% of Amazon’s income.\n\nMoving away from AWS, Amazon has also signed multiple long-term deals with Seattle Kraken hockey games and NBA games to boost its Prime offering.\n\nOverall, on the retail side, Amazon is still getting a big chunk of new spending, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) experts say that the company is becoming even more competitive.\n\nAccording to the most recent report, the global e-commerce company made almost $576 billion in net sales, up from $514 billion the previous year, primarily from online retail sales; consensus points to a potential 21% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) operates in cybersecurity, an important part of the world economy that will grow by 11% from 2024 to 2028 and reach $273 billion in value by 2028; it holds about a 24% share of the endpoint protection market.\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform continues to bring in new customers, as shown by the 34% year-over-year growth in yearly ongoing income revealed in the most recent earnings.\n\nCrowdStrike’s fourth-quarter 2024 earning-per-share was 95 cents, well over the expert expectation of 82 cents, and revenues were $845 million, higher than the $839 million predicted.\n\nOn the product side, CrowdStrike showed off its Falcon Next-Gen SIEM system for the first time at the RSA Conference 2024. CrowdStrike also put out Falcon for Defender, which protects Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Defender setups by constantly looking for risks.\n\nCrowdStrike and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud are also working together more closely to improve AI-based hacking incident response and MDR using Falcon and Mandiant. In addition, CrowdStrike and NinjaOne are working together to offer full computer protection.\n\nCrowdStrike’s revenue for 2024 was around $3 billion, 36% more than in 2023; consensus points to an around 16% upside, enhancing its appeal among growth stocks to buy.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car. Interior of Li Auto EV. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith 800,000 cars to deliver in 2024, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) wants to double the number of cars it delivered last year.\n\nThe Chinese new energy vehicle company is also planning to have more than 5,000 supercharging sites online by 2025, spread out across 90% of major highways and 90% of the core urban areas in Tier 4 and more developed towns.\n\nThe new L6 SUV from Li Auto is also exciting investors. LI stock went up because the upscale electric SUV starts at $34,500. The price is relatively affordable within the premium electric SUV market, and the new model received over 10,000 orders within 72 hours of debuting.\n\nHowever, the stock is down 41% because Q1 2024 vehicle sales missed analyst estimates, and its electric SUV launch is delayed until the second half of 2025 due to infrastructure issues.\n\nAnalysts, however, expect a turnaround for the first major China EV startup to turn a profit, projecting an upside of 76%, making it can’t miss among growth stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "5 Sector ETFs With Double-Digit Gains in May",
        "content": "Wall Street has been on a solid rally in May, buoyed by renewed Fed rate cut bets, solid corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. All three major bourses hit record highs this month, touching new milestones. The S&P 500 crossed 5,300, the Dow Jones Industrial Average touched 40,000 and the Nasdaq Composite Index topped 17,000 for the first time ever (read: Nasdaq Tops 17K: 5 Best-Performing Stocks in ETF YTD).\r\n\r\nThe gains were broad-based and well spread out across various segments. Some of the top performers in the ETF space from different corners of the market were S&P Kensho Cleantech ETF CTEX, SonicShares Global Shipping ETF BOAT, Themes Silver Miners ETF AGMI, Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF URNJ and Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC.\r\n\r\nEarnings grew 6% in the first quarter of 2024, the highest rate of growth seen in nearly two years. NVIDIA’s NVDA blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism in the stock market in recent weeks along with the global AI boom.\r\n\r\nThe latest bouts of data showed that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. US business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth, led by an upturn in the service sector. Consumer confidence, as indicated by the Conference Board’s gauge of sentiment, increased in May after three months of declines.\r\n\r\nWall Street is getting more bullish on stocks, given the improving outlook for both earnings and economic growth. Over the past two weeks, three equity strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have boosted their year-end targets for the S&P 500. The median target on Wall Street for the benchmark index now sits at 5,250, up from the median target of 4,850 on Dec 30, per Bloomberg data.\r\n\r\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nHowever, uncertainty about the timing of rate cuts continued to weigh on investors’ sentiment lately.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nLet’s dig into the details of the abovementioned ETFs:\r\n\r\nS&P Kensho Cleantech ETF (CTEX) – Up 19%\r\n\r\nThe clean energy space got a boost from the bullishness over AI. Artificial intelligence is poised to accelerate and propel the energy transition, being both a heavy consumer and facilitator of clean energy.

        "content": "The technology industry has been booming over the past year, and many are looking for semiconductor stocks to buy. Semiconductors have been a standout industry. The benchmark ETF for the semiconductor industry as a whole is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which has returned 69% in the past year, while the S&P 500 has only returned 26% within the same time period.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been on the cutting edge of innovation, and investors are still very interested in the industry’s ability to adapt and change.\n\nBelow, I discuss three semiconductor stocks that may not be very well known compared to industry giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). However, these stocks are up-and-coming stocks that have seen impressive share price appreciation and still hold a decent valuation with room to grow within this rapidly evolving industry.\r\n\r\nHere are some semiconductor stocks to buy:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Buy: ACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) primarily supplies the semiconductor industry with wafer cleaning and wet processing equipment. It also offers electrochemical plating services.\n\nOn May 8, earnings for the first quarter of 2024 were released. Total revenue and net income both doubled year-over-year to $152 million and $22 million, respectively. Earnings for the first quarter beat analyst expectations, similar to Q4 2023.\n\nFirst-quarter shipments increased by 175% compared to the previous year. The overall outlook for the full year 2024 remained the same: ACMR predicts that total revenue will be between $650 million and $725 million.\n\nOver the past year, its share price has increased by 130%. And it’s still trading at a strong valuation, especially within the semiconductor industry. Its forward P/E ratio is 12.98 times, while the sector average is 23.94 times.\n\nACMR still offers investors the capabilities of very strong returns, especially if it keeps beating analyst predictions regarding earnings.\n\nASE Technology (ASX) Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ADR) (NYSE:ASX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nASX Technology (NYSE:ASX) is a semiconductor and testing company that provides a wide range of industry support services.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has risen by 48%.\n\nOn Apr. 25, ASE Technology reported earnings results for the first quarter of 2024, stating that total revenue increased by 1% and net income fell by 2% year over year.\n\nASE Technology also provides investors with a strong dividend yield, which is an anomaly, particularly for the semiconductor industry. Its dividend is distributed on an annual basis. The most recent dividend given to investors was fifty-six cents per share, paid out on Aug. 3, 2023. Its overall yield at this time is approximately 5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilar to ACMR, ASX is trading at a fair valuation compared to the sector as a whole. Its forward P/E ratio is 17.97 times, while the sector’s median forward P/E is 23.94 times.\n\nASE Technology has experienced solid share price appreciation and still offers a fair valuation to investors. Definitely one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy, in my opinion.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) specializes in the production and distribution of photomask technology for use in the manufacturing of integrated circuits and flat panel displays. It sells its products to various semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has increased by 29%.\n\nOn May 22, Photronics reported earnings for the second quarter of 2024, stating that total revenue of $217 million and net income of $56 million fell by 5% year over year.\n\nPLAB also provided guidance for the third quarter, in which it anticipates revenue will be between $221 million and $229 million.\n\nPhotoronics has also had some recent leadership changes. Its previous Chief Financial Officer, John Jordan, retired in February. On May 28, Eric Rivera, the interim CFO following John Jordan’s retirement, was named its new CFO.\n\nPLAB is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 13.00 times, while the median sector P/E is 23.94 times.\n\nThe recent lackluster earnings report somewhat shocked investors into selling their shares. But, with an improved outlook for the third quarter of 2024 over Q2. PLAB still offers decent potential for investors looking for semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Following Strong Earnings Report",
        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Following Strong Earnings Report\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares closed slightly higher during Wednesday's session, continuing its rally.\n\nThe chipmaker giant's stock has gained every trading session since releasing its stronger-than-expected earnings report last Wednesday. Since then, shares of Nvidia has jumped around 21%.\n\nOn May 22, Nvidia reported better-than-expected financial results for its first quarter and issued strong guidance for the second quarter. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 150%.\n\nThe megacap tech name has seen an astounding 186% surge since the end of May 2023, fueled by skyrocketing demand for chips in artificial intelligence development.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Nvidia, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Nvidia offers an annual dividend yield of 0.03%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 10 cents per share (40 cents a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $17,223,750 or around 15,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $3,444,750 or around 3,000 shares.\n\nRead This: Top 3 Tech And Telecom Stocks That Could Blast Off This Quarter\n\nView more earnings on NVDA\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.40 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.40 = 15,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.40 = 3,000 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 0.8% to close at $1,148.25 on Wednesday.\n\nRead More: Jim Cramer Recommends Buying Apple, Finds This Tech Stock ‘Very Interesting‘\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Following Strong Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Harding Loevner, an asset management company, released its “Global Equity Strategy” first-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The fund generated a 6.9% gross of fee return in the first quarter compared to an 8.3% gain for the MSCI All Country World. Despite rising bond yields, the stock market gained throughout the quarter, partly because of continued interest in the potential applications of artificial intelligence. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 33.87%, and its shares gained 188.88% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On May 20, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $1,148.25 per share with a market capitalization of $2.823 trillion.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"The Information Technology ('IT') sector was once again the top performer, closing the period with a 12% increase, led by substantial gains in semiconductor stocks.

Our initial purchase came at a time when concerns over excess inventory in gaming chips had been weighing on Nvidia’s valuation, which presented an attractive buying opportunity. Since then, the stock price has skyrocketed, particularly following the November 2022 launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool, which introduced much of the business world to the practical applications of generative AI and put a spotlight on the key enabling technology—semiconductors...\"(Click here to read the full text)\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Constellation Energy, Micron Technology, Moderna and Qualcomm",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 30, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Constellation Energy Corp. CEG, Micron Technology MU, Moderna Inc. MRNA and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nBest-Performing Stocks in the Nasdaq QQQ Year-to-Date\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index hit a new record high, topping the 17,000 level for the first time ever. Solid corporate earnings and rate cut bets have been driving stocks higher. In particular, NVIDIA's blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism into the stock market along with the global artificial intelligence (AI) boom. This led the Nasdaq to move further higher. The tech-heavy index has risen 13.4% so far this year.\n\nInvesco QQQ,which serves as a proxy to the Nasdaq Index, gained 12% in the year-to-date timeframe. As such, we have highlighted the five best-performing stocks of QQQ this year that led the way higher in the portfolio. These are NVIDIA Corp., Constellation Energy Corp., Micron Technology, Moderna Inc. and Qualcomm Inc..\n\nNVIDIA topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its AI-enabled GPU chips. The AI chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share (read: NVIDIA's Explosive Earnings: Should You Buy the Stock or ETFs Now?).\n\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\n\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth in the tech sector and beyond. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\n\nHowever, concerns over stubborn inflation once again might halt the rally in the Index. This is because the Fed minutes and upbeat manufacturing data, both of which highlight concerns over stubborn inflation, have again pushed back the timing of rate cuts.\n\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, it failed to show further progress toward the Fed's 2% objective in recent months, per its latest minutes. As such, the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought. Meanwhile, U.S. business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth led by an upturn in the service sector. The data indicates that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. The strength in the economy could spark a revival in inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet's take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.\n\nQQQ in Focus\n\nInvesco QQQ provides exposure to 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. Information technology accounts for 58.9% of the assets, while consumer discretionary makes up 17.9% share.\n\nInvesco QQQ is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $268.2 billion and an average daily volume of around 37 million shares. Invesco QQQ charges investors 20 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: What's in the Cards for Nasdaq ETFs?).\n\nBelow, we have highlighted the above-mentioned five stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund's basket.\n\nTop-Performing Stocks in QQQ\n\nNVIDIAis the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU.

        "title": "Dell Escapes Nvidia’s Shadow as Its Own AI Tailwinds Accelerate",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. shares have been acting like market-leader Nvidia Corp. of late, and investors are betting the company will see a similar boost from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid American Air Fired Commercial Head After Sales Strategy Alienated Corporate Clients\n\nThe maker of personal computers and servers has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the AI boom, and this narrative is likely to be reinforced when it reports its first-quarter results after the close. Confirmation of improving growth prospects could continue to support a stock that’s at a record high while trading at a discount to other tech favorites.\n\nDell recently generated excitement by unveiling a line of PCs optimized for AI, adding to hopes that such features could prompt a long-awaited upgrade cycle from customers and businesses. HP Inc. on Wednesday reported the first increase in PC sales in two years.\n\nAt the same time, its high-powered servers have been endorsed by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who praised his company’s “great partnership” with Dell at its GTC conference and said that “nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”\n\nThe firm “has become a really important part of the AI ecosystem, and it still hasn’t gotten enough credit for that,” said Doug Clinton, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\n\n“Both the PC and the server businesses will drive growth in coming years, and that’s supportive of both the stock and the multiple. We really see it as both a growth and a value play, since the growth story is still under-appreciated and the multiple is very low relative to other AI plays.”\n\nShares have climbed 127% this year, and are coming off a six-day rally, their longest streak since July. The stock fell 3% on Thursday. Much of this year’s gain has come in the wake of Dell’s previous report, which showed AI fueling massive demand for its servers.\n\nOne reason Dell may be somewhat off the radar of investors is that, even though it has a market capitalization in excess of $127 billion — making it larger than the vast majority of S&P 500 components — it isn’t a member of the large-cap equity index. It had previously not been eligible given its multiple share classes, but S&P Dow Jones Indices scrapped a rule preventing such companies from inclusion last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect Dell to be added, and view its inclusion as a potential catalyst for the stock. Super Micro Computer Inc., another play on AI servers, was added in March, despite having a market cap below $50 billion.\n\nThe S&P 500 is rebalanced quarterly, with the next scheduled to occur in June. Becoming a component would open Dell up to a new universe of investors who use the S&P 500 as their benchmark, as well as flows into passive funds that track the index.\n\n“Dell remains an under-owned and underweighted stock and with the potential catalysts of AI and potential inclusion in the S&P,” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a May 29 report in which he raised his price target, citing the beneficial impact from AI servers, high-end storage and PCs.\n\nBofA’s higher target is a reflection of how analysts are bullish on the stock. More than 80% of the firms tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the shares, and Morgan Stanley has it as a top pick, calling it the best stock to play server momentum, inflecting storage demand, and an improving PC market.\n\nRead more: Dell’s Sales Seen Recovering on AI Servers: Preview\n\nThat growing optimism has prevented the multiple from getting into nosebleed territory. The consensus for the company’s net 2025 earnings has risen by 7.6% over the past month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the revenue consensus is up 1.3% over that period.\n\nShares trade at 22 times estimated earnings, a notable discount to the Nasdaq 100 Index, and cheaper than other AI plays, including Nvidia, Super Micro, and Microsoft Corp. However, Dell’s multiple is a record for the stock, and well above its five-year average of 5.8.\n\n“Dell is becoming an increasingly strategic vendor in AI, but there’s a lot more appreciation for this than there was a few months ago,” said Dan Flax, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman. “Demand for AI systems remains healthy, but other parts of the business remain cyclical, and if we see a macro downturn, even a growth story as powerful as AI could slow down.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nSalesforce Inc. shares fell as much as 19% on Thursday, a drop that would represent its biggest one-day percentage decline in more than 15 years. The selloff came after the cloud-based software firm said sales growth in the current quarter will stall to its slowest in history.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTesla Inc. is a company in disarray. Layoffs are mounting. Morale is shattered. Its stock is cratering and sales are anemic. And, some investors say, it’s got a distracted leader at the helm. HP Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts’ estimates, including the first increase in PC sales in two years, an optimistic signal for a long-awaited rebound in the market. Apple Inc. is seeking a senior engineer to help build a television and sports app for Android, a sign the company is finally bringing its TV+ service to the rival smartphone platform. Generative artificial intelligence is only just starting to make its economic impact felt, OpenAI Inc. Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said. Amazon.com Inc. is increasing its stake in Grubhub to as much as 18% and expanding its partnership with the food delivery service to allow US users to order takeout directly on Amazon’s website and shopping app.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPostmarket\n\nDell Technologies Marvell Technology Zscaler MongoDB NetApp Inc Elastic HashiCorp SentinelOne Asana Ambarella PagerDuty Inc\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year New York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo's Race to Boost Supplies Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Listen to Nvidia. This Little-Known, Undervalued Company Could Be a Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Pick Now",
        "content": "If there was any doubt about the strength of the AI boom in the stock market and the broader economy, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just put those questions to rest.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, the AI chip titan just posted another blockbuster earnings report, including year-over-year revenue growth of 262% overall and 427% in the data center segment, where the AI revolution is taking place.\n\nThose numbers weren't a huge surprise to those that have been following the stock, but they were still better than expected as was the company's guidance for the second quarter. It was enough to add roughly $200 billion to Nvidia's market cap.\n\nHowever, what really stoked excitement for the artificial intelligence revolution was commentary from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, indicating that growth in the AI market was still in its early stages and that demand was still soaring, outstripping supply.\n\nFor example, Nvidia noted that 40% of data center revenue was the result of AI inference, meaning that training, the other key component of creating generative AI models, likely made up a majority of data center revenue in the quarter. The company said that both training and inference were growing \"significantly.\"\n\nThat's important, because inference is expected to eventually be a much larger part of data center demand than training since inference is the part that comes after training. If AI inference demand is still smaller than AI training demand currently, then that means the companies and organizations using generative AI are still in the very early stages of scaling generative AI demand. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI power struggle\n\nRunning generative AI models consumes enormous amounts of power, and the issue has mostly gone overlooked thus far in the generative AI boom. Predictions about generative AI power consumption vary, but some say it will impact the electrical grid in ways not seen since the spread of central air conditioning in the 1960s. According to Goldman Sachs, data center power demand is expected to grow 160% by 2030.\n\nIf those estimates are accurate, the real winners in the AI-driven energy crunch are likely to include the power suppliers themselves, meaning utility companies like Dominion Energy (NYSE: D).\n\nNearly all of Dominion Energy's profit comes from Virginia, where it enjoys a regulated monopoly in utilities. The company's annual report says that it faces no competition for electric distribution service and \"no such competition is currently permitted.\"\n\nThat's significant, because Virginia is a major market for data centers. In fact, Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, and the state has roughly 35% of hyperscale data centers worldwide globally. These are the data centers that belong to some of Nvidia's biggest cloud computing customers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs those companies ramp up their AI data center operations, Dominion looks poised to benefit. On a recent earnings call, management noted, \"Northern Virginia leads the world in data center markets. In recent years, this growth has accelerated in orders of magnitude.\"\n\nWhy now is a great time to buy\n\nInvestors primarily own utility stocks for their dividends, as these recession-proof companies tend to be reliable income stocks.\n\nHowever, most utility stocks have fallen over the last couple of years; rising interest rates have caused dividend investors to park their money in bonds instead, as treasuries are now paying more than 5%. You can see that weakness reflected in Dominion's performance over the last three years. D Chart\n\nThe stock is down 33% over the last three years, even as the S&P 500 index has surged to new all-time highs.\n\nDominion currently offers a 5% dividend yield, making it appealing as an income stock.

        "content": "The Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) juggernaut is showing no signs of stopping as the semiconductor behemoth delivered another set of stunning results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (for the three months ended April 28) on May 22 that easily crushed Wall Street's expectations.\n\nWhile Nvidia's revenue jumped a whopping 262% year over year to $26 billion, its non-GAAP earnings shot up 461% to $6.12 per share. Analysts would have settled for $5.60 per share in earnings on revenue of $24.6 billion. What's more, Nvidia has guided for fiscal second-quarter revenue of $28 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be more than double the $13.5 billion revenue it posted in the prior-year period and well above the $26.6 billion consensus estimate.\n\nThere were more goodies in store for Nvidia investors as the company increased its quarterly-cash dividend by 150% and also pointed out that it will start shipping its next-generation Blackwell chips ahead of schedule. All this indicates that Nvidia's red-hot stock market rally is here to stay. The stock has jumped 115% in 2024 already, and its latest results and guidance point toward more gains.\n\nBut if you're one of those investors who have missed the Nvidia gravy train and are wary of buying the stock now because of its expensive valuation -- even though it may be able to justify it -- it would be a good idea to take a closer look at Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Let's look at the reasons why.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nNvidia's phenomenal results gave server manufacturer Super Micro Computer a nice boost. That wasn't surprising as the robust demand for Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI)-focused chips bodes well for Super Micro, whose server solutions are used for mounting those chips in data centers.\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the demand for its current and next-generation chips could exceed supply going into 2025. That's good news for Super Micro as it should continue to see healthy demand for its AI-optimized servers and sustain the terrific growth it has been clocking in recent quarters. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSMCI Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue forecast of $14.9 billion for the current fiscal year would translate into a 110% increase from the previous year's reading of $7.1 billion. Similarly, its earnings expectation of $23.69 per share for fiscal 2024 would be double last year's level of $11.81 per share. However, it won't be surprising to see Super Micro growing at a faster pace than it is currently forecasting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's because the company has already revealed server solutions for Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which will start shipping in the current quarter and ramp up as the year progresses. Reports suggest that Super Micro has already received huge orders for servers optimized for mounting Blackwell processors, and it could be expected to fulfill a quarter of the demand for servers built using Nvidia's next-gen chips.\n\nNot surprisingly, Super Micro's top and bottom lines are expected to grow substantially over the next couple of fiscal years. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nSMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nSuper Micro's revenue is expected to quadruple in just three years (given that it delivered $7.1 billion in revenue in the previous fiscal year), while earnings could jump 3.5 times by fiscal 2026 from fiscal 2023's reading of $11.81 per share. More importantly, it isn't too late for investors to buy this AI stock as it is trading at an attractive 4.4 times sales and 25 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, has a sales multiple of 33 along with a forward-earnings multiple of 43. Even better, analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years, giving investors yet another solid reason to accumulate this stock before it flies higher.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake may not be as popular an AI name as the other two companies discussed in this article. But the company, which provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations to store, organize, analyze, and build applications using their proprietary data, believes that AI could become its next big growth driver.\n\nSnowflake stock is down over 21% in 2024 thanks to poor guidance and management transition announced in February. However, the company's first-quarter fiscal 2025 results (for the three months ended April 30) suggest that AI could play an important role in driving future growth.\n\nThe company's top line increased 33% year over year to $829 million, easily exceeding the $787 million consensus estimate. More importantly, the company's fiscal Q2 product-revenue forecast of $805 million to $810 million was ahead of the $793 million estimate and points toward a year-over-year increase of 26.5% at the midpoint. The company has also raised its full-year product-revenue guidance to $3.3 billion from $3.25 billion.\n\nSnowflake's remaining performance obligations, a metric that refers to the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled, increased 46% year over year to $5 billion. That was faster than the growth in its top line, indicating that the company is building a solid revenue pipeline for the future.\n\nIt seems that AI is playing a central role in boosting Snowflake's growth prospects. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy pointed out in the company's press release: \"Our AI products, now generally available, are generating strong customer interest. They will help our customers deliver effective and efficient AI-powered experiences faster than ever.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Snowflake has been investing aggressively in AI infrastructure and has been looking to quickly deploy AI-focused products to help its customers make the most of their data. The company has also teamed up with Nvidia to help its customers deploy custom AI models for various tasks, such as translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, extracting content from documents, and creating generative AI-powered assistants.\n\nAdditionally, Snowflake is looking to shore up its AI capabilities by acquiring TruEra, an observability platform that will allow enterprises to monitor and evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) and machine learning models. Such moves should allow Snowflake to set itself up for stronger long-term growth as high-quality data is important for the development of robust, generative AI applications.\n\nAs such, it won't be surprising to see Snowflake stock gaining momentum as its AI-focused moves start paying off. The stock is currently trading at 17 times sales. Though that's expensive, the sales multiple is lower than last year's reading of 24 and significantly cheaper than Nvidia. However, it may become more expensive in the future thanks to Snowflake's growing AI chops, which is why it would be a good idea to buy it before it soars higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Blue-Chip Bubble Trouble: 7 Stocks to Short as Valuations Stretch to the Limit",
        "content": "If you’re wondering which overvalued blue-chip stocks to ditch right now, look no further. The best investors pay attention to a stock’s valuation. Warren Buffett famously avoids buying stocks that are trading at more than 15 times future earnings estimates. Any stock with a higher multiple is too expensive for the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett’s most recent stock purchase, Swiss insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB), is trading at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11 times future earnings forecasts.\n\nWithin the benchmark S&P 500 index, the average P/E ratio is currently just over 27, having risen along with the bull market that began 18 months ago. Stocks are compared to the average multiple to determine whether they are expensive relative to their peers. Some stocks justify a high valuation due to their strong earnings growth and share price appreciation. Others are dangerously overvalued and destined for a correction.\n\nHere is blue-chip bubble trouble: seven stocks to short as valuations stretch to the limit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) have performed well, rising 120% in the past 12 months, including a 40% gain on the year. In the last five years, CRWD stock has increased 444%. While the share price appreciation has been impressive, the growth has made CrowdStrike a very expensive stock to own. The company’s shares are currently trading at 950 times future earnings estimates.\n\nSome investors might feel the premium valuation is justified as CrowdStrike continues to grow at a brisk clip. CRWD stock rose 23% in one day during March after the company reported fourth quarter 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forward guidance. On an earnings call, management reiterated their goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2030.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has been one of the best performing cybersecurity stocks, there’s no denying that the shares are expensive right now. The company next reports earnings on June 4.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nData analytics company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is also richly valued, trading at 165 times future earnings forecasts. Like CrowdStrike, Palantir stock has been a strong performer, rising 43% in the past year and climbing 26% so far in 2024. However, the valuation on PLTR stock is starting to look stretched with the shares trading at such a high multiple relative to earnings expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Denver, Colorado-based company recently reported EPS of 8 cents, yet its stock is trading at nearly $21 a share. While the company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters, analysts are raising concerns about the lofty valuation. The high P/E ratio is the main reason why there is a consensus “hold” rating on Palantir stock among 12 Wall Street analysts who cover the company.\n\nPalantir builds artificial intelligence (AI) software for governments and corporations, and its stock looks to have gotten caught up in the AI trade this year, pushing up the valuation.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAhead of its upcoming 50-for-1 stock split, one of the biggest in market history, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is trading at a lofty valuation for a quick service restaurant chain. Currently, CMG stock is trading at 67 times future earnings forecasts. That compares to a valuation of 21 times earnings estimates for rival McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). Not only does Chipotle have a high valuation but its share price is out of reach for many investors trading at more than $3,100.\n\nThe stock split is meant to help with the affordability of Chipotle’s shares. However, the valuation is likely to remain rich as investors pay a premium to own the fast-growing restaurant chain that specializes in Mexican cuisine. CMG stock has grown 52% in the last 12 months, bringing its five-year growth rate to 375%. Chipotle has been one of the best-performing stocks to own in the restaurant sector.\n\nWhile CMG stock has been rallying leading up to the stock split on June 26, there could be a selloff after the split is executed. Investors should proceed with caution.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nBelieve it or not, shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are more expensive currently than archrival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. AMD stock is trading at a P/E multiple of 247. That compares to 65 times forward earnings estimates for NVDA stock. Of course, Nvidia just reported that its profit rose more than 600% in the first quarter from a year earlier.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has gained the high valuation partly from its own earnings growth, and also because of lofty expectations for the company’s new AI microchips. AMD is seen as the main challenger to Nvidia in the fast-growing market for AI chips and semiconductors, where global demand is exploding. In the last 12 months, the share price of AMD has increased 36%. Through five years, the stock is up 523%.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Robinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) have exploded over the last year as a bull market in both stocks and cryptocurrencies has investors trading more. In the past 12 months, HOOD stock has gained 127%, outpacing most other equities. The rocketing share price has pushed Robinhood Markets’ P/E ratio sky-high. It’s at a point where Robinhood stock is trading at 141 times future earnings.\n\nThe pricey valuation comes as investors cheer the brokerage and its financial results. On the back of strong trading activity, Robinhood recently reported record first-quarter financial results. The company singled out crypto trading on its platform as being largely responsible for its strong financial results. Cryptocurrency transaction revenue more than tripled in Q1 from a year earlier. In the last month alone, HOOD stock has risen 17%.\n\nEli Lilly And Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) has a big catalyst with its weight loss drug Zepbound. Robust sales of the weight loss medication have powered Eli Lilly’s sales and stock to new heights in recent months. In the past year, LLY stock has climbed nearly 90% higher. That brings the stock’s five-year appreciation to almost 600%. The sharp rise in the share price has led to a significant increase in the stock’s valuation.\n\nCurrently, LLY stock is trading at 118 time earnings estimates. That compares to a P/E ratio of less than 10 for rival Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE:JNJ) stock. Pharmaceutical stocks are known for having low P/E multiples. This begs the question of whether the valuation of Eli Lilly’s stock is justified? Analysts seem to feel it is given that Zepbound is expected to post sales of more than $1 billion in its first year on the market, and it could become the biggest-selling drug of all time.\n\nOvervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO), the leading credit scoring agency in the U.S., has been a consistent, long-term winner for investors. FICO stock has risen 22% this year, 75% over the last 12 months, and 367% in the past five years. The company’s near monopoly on credit scoring services in the U.S. has led to consistently strong earnings growth and a stock that seemingly always rises. But that growth has made Fair Isaac’s stock expensive.\n\nToday, FICO stock is trading at 72 times future earnings estimates. While the Bozeman, Montana-based company has a market capitalization of $34 billion, it is currently trading at a higher multiple than most of the Magnificent 7 mega-cap tech stocks that have market caps above $1 trillion. There’s no question that shareholders pay a premium to own Fair Isaac stock. But the company’s growth and competitive position in the marketplace help account for the rich valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, LLY and FICO.

        "content": "We recently published a list of top 10 most buzzing AI semiconductor stocks in 2024. Since Micron ranks higher in the list, it needs a deeper look. But first, let's see what's happening in the semiconductor industry with a special focus on AI.\n\nThe semiconductor industry seems have found a new growth catalyst in the form of AI that could keep it thriving and abuzz for years to come, as analysts see no end in sight for the demand for AI-specific chips needed to power generative AI applications that would be ubiquitous from just a few years from now. Earlier this month, analysts at Citi published a bullish note for semiconductor stocks, citing strong March sales, which jumped about 15.7% year over year to total $50.6 billion. The figure was higher than Citi's $50.1 billion estimate. Citi analyst Christopher Danely highlighted that most of the demand bump came from analog and microcontrollers, which were up about 50% on a month-over-month basis.\n\nAre AI Semiconductor Stocks Overvalued?\n\nSemiconductor stocks have run so much on the back of the AI boom that many are voicing valuation concerns.

From these stocks we chose the ones with the highest number of hedge fund investors and strong YTD gains. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nAn aerial view of a bustling semiconductor production zone showcasing the company’s integrated circuits.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nYTD Price Performance: +8.64%\n\nLast month Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted strong Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.62, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue jumped 2.2% year over year to $5.47 billion, beating estimates by $20 million. For the second quarter, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) expects revenue in the range of $5.7 +/- $300 million, compared to the consensus estimate of $5.69 billion.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur said Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) can increase its datacenter GPU revenue to over $5 billion in 2024 and continue to poach market share from Intel in server and PC CPUs market.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Better than NVDA?\n\nIt seems NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) always takes the center stage when it comes to the AI semiconductor industry. Take a cursory look at the latest earnings calls and you'll see executives joining the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) praise chorus, chalking out plans to pile into more H100 GPUs. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s latest results show a spectacular increase in data center revenue, but a lackluster increase in operating income (+26%) threw water on the enthusiasm around the stock. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) bears also say the stock's P/E ratio of over 240 is amongst the highest in the chips industry. Surprisingly, AMD's forward P/E ratio is about two times higher than Nvidia's.\n\nWith NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuations already raising concerns and AMD coming in not as attractive, what are the options for beginner investors who are looking to board the AI rally? The market is always presenting itself with opportunities for those who know where to look.

        "title": "Double Delight- 3 Tech Stocks Delivering Dividends and Growth",
        "content": "The tech industry is a hot space right now. Investors are watching the segment with keen interest, and it is understandable why there is so much attention on the space. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is grabbing headlines, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has set a record. Those who missed out on holding Nvidia are now on the lookout for tech dividend stocks that could show a similar rally. AI has become a part of several industries and is indispensable today.\n\nThe earnings season shows the importance of AI, and while Nvidia is wearing the crown right now, several other tech companies have been steadily growing. If you are a passive income investor and want the best of both dividends and growth, here are three tech stocks with strong upside potential and steady dividend payouts. Let’s take a look at these companies have a strong industry presence and a record of delivering dividends.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustry favorite Taiwan SemiconductorManufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is an undervalued stock. Trading at $159, it is up 57% year-to-date (YTD) and 315% in the past five years. As the demand for chips continues to grow, TSM is set to benefit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is the world’s largest chip maker and produces chips for companies including Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It holds 60% of the market share in the foundry industry and 85% of the market share in the AI chip industry.\n\nA leader in the industry, TSM will benefit as Nvidia grows. Both companies have a close connection, and with the soaring demand for AI chips, TSM is set to expand. The company is struggling in the smartphone segment while thriving in the AI chip market. It will have to find a balance so that the drop in smartphone segment revenue does not impact the business as a whole.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter results, TSM beat analyst estimates and reported revenue of $19.62 billion. It aims to begin mass production of 4-nanometer (nm) chips at its new Arizona plant in 2025.\n\nTSM enjoys a dividend yield of 1.52%, and the payout ratio stands at 33% of the earnings. This shows there is a potential to increase dividends in the coming years.\n\nWhile TSM stock hasn’t had a rally like Nvidia, there is a lot of upside potential from here. The demand is going to remain strong, and as a dominant chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is set to benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been writing about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for a while now, and am impressed with the way the business is expanding. A global software company, Oracle has been in the industry for many years and is taking on AI demand with the right products. The company is building 100 new data centers and has signed noteworthy partnerships which will strengthen its market position.\n\nBesides partnering with Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) and Nvidia, Oracle has recently deepened its 30-year association with Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and will continue to offer generative AI solutions. Both companies aim to help businesses with data analysis.\n\nTrading at $124, ORCL stock is up 19% YTD and soared 6% in the past month. Investors who believe that the future is AI should start accumulating ORCL stock. The company impressed the market in third-quarter results that featured strong financials. The revenue hit $13.3 billion, up 7% while the cloud services segment was up 25% and reported revenue of $5.1 billion. An important metric, the remaining performance obligations hit $80 billion, up 29% year over year (YOY).\n\nOracle is a fundamentally stable company with a strong history. It enjoys a dividend yield of 1.29% and has increased dividends for 14 consecutive years. Oracle is a stock to buy and hold for the next decade. Its AI investments will drive growth in the coming years.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) cisco (CSCO) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.46%, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an ideal choice for dividend investors. The company is a hidden gem that does not get the attention it deserves.\n\nTrading at $46, the stock is down 8% YTD and has been moving sideways over the past few months. The company is working on enhancing its AI offerings. While it is a little behind in the AI race, it is very much a part of the race.\n\nIt reported revenue of $12.7 billion, down 13% YOY in the third quarter, and earnings per share (EPS) came in at 88 cents. Net income dropped 41% and management believes it was because of existing users setting up the equipment they received. The management enhanced its outlook with revenue guidance in the range of $53.6 billion to $53.8 billion.\n\nCisco has increased dividends for 13 consecutive years, and with the product order trends looking up, I believe it has the potential to increase the dividends in the coming years.\n\nInvestors aren’t happy with the results or the guidance but I believe the AI investments will pay off in the long term. The stock looks cheap to me and is a good choice for those looking to make money from dividends while the stock grows. Cisco stock isn’t going to show any immediate upside and it isn’t risk-free but if you are in it for the dividends, it is worth a bet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Enterprise AI stocks tend to represent companies that focus on solving complex business problems by leveraging powerful algorithms. Consumer AI, on the other hand, tends to be less complex and deals primarily with user interface and experience overall. Stocks representing companies in both realms represent incredible opportunities.\n\nHowever, this article will focus on stocks representing companies powering the enterprise AI boom. So, just how big is the opportunity overall? The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 44.1% between 2023 and 2032. That will bring the overall value above $270 billion. The opportunity is crystal clear so let’s look at a few strong stocks leading the way.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s so much that could be discussed in relation to Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock as it relates to enterprise AI. For example, the partnership between Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) and Palantir.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOracle is noted for the strength of its distributed cloud and AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Palantir’s strength lies in its AI and decision acceleration platforms. The two firms forged a partnership to leverage those respective capabilities and build solutions for government partners.\n\nThe point I’d like to focus on here is the characterization of PLTR as a strong decision acceleration platform. Remember, enterprise AI requires the most complex and powerful algorithms leveraged to solve enterprise scale problems. Palantir has emerged as one of the strongest firms in that realm.\n\nTake the recent downturn in share prices at Palantir as the opportunity that it is. It’s a company that hit profitability far sooner than anyone could have expected and is bound to continue to grow moving forward.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is currently one of the more interesting stocks available to investors. It looks like Chinese stocks are finally reemerging. The nation’s tech leaders continue to do well despite a choppy economy overall.\n\nBaidu is one of the very best AI opportunities for investors interested in China. The company touts its full AI stack encompassing a complex infrastructure of computing needs.\n\nThe company’s ERNIE bot is a particular bright spot. BIDU reported that it had 26,000 enterprise AI clients for that bot late in February. That represented a 150% increase over the previous quarter.\n\nGenerally speaking, Chinese firms have lacked behind their North American counterparts when it comes to generative AI. Baidu is working hard to change that and its recent investment in enterprise AI makes it particularly noteworthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains at the forefront of most things artificial intelligence. The ubiquity of its chips across artificial intelligence applications has caused the stock to soar. It’s clear from the most recent earnings report that the opportunity in Nvidia is not going away anytime soon. What is also very clear is that Nvidia is among the most important enterprise AI stocks overall.\n\nMost enterprise AI workloads are performed at hyperscale data centers. That is exactly where the majority of Nvidia chips are being sold. $22.6 billion of Nvidia’s $26 billion in first quarter sales was attributable to data center sales.\n\nNvidia produces the most powerful chips and those chips are leveraged for the most complex challenges. Again, those challenges manifest at the enterprise AI level where solutions are the most complex. The continued enterprise AI opportunity is one more indication that Nvidia is the best of the best in relation to enterprise AI stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently published a list of top 10 most buzzing AI semiconductor stocks in 2024. Since Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) ranks higher in the list, it needs a deeper look. But first, let's see what's happening in the semiconductor industry with a special focus on AI.\n\nThe semiconductor industry seems have found a new growth catalyst in the form of AI that could keep it thriving and abuzz for years to come, as analysts see no end in sight for the demand for AI-specific chips needed to power generative AI applications that would be ubiquitous from just a few years from now. Earlier this month, analysts at Citi published a bullish note for semiconductor stocks, citing strong March sales, which jumped about 15.7% year over year to total $50.6 billion. The figure was higher than Citi's $50.1 billion estimate. Citi analyst Christopher Danely highlighted that most of the demand bump came from analog and microcontrollers, which were up about 50% on a month-over-month basis.\n\nAre AI Semiconductor Stocks Overvalued?\n\nSemiconductor stocks have run so much on the back of the AI boom that many are voicing valuation concerns. And it's always surprising when such concerns come from Cathie Wood, one of the notable growth investors of this age who poured (and lost) a fortune into hyper-growth stocks trading at eye-popping valuations. In March, Cathie Wood warned that the semiconductor space could see a \"correction.\" However, Wood clarified that she's just expecting a \"correction\" and not an \"end\" of the sector.\n\nSince the end of March, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is up 10%.\n\nBut Cathie Wood isn't alone in these valuation worries. Analysts believe since the AI-rally is no longer limited to big names like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and MSFT, investors should caste a wider net. And we did just that. Our latest research unlocked many AI-related stocks trading at attractive valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nFor this article we used stock screeners and did manual research to see which AI-related semiconductor stocks were generating the most buzz.

Ltd.'s (NYSE:TSM) revenue in the quarter ending April 30 increased 26.2% from a year ago. Top companies like Nvidia, Apple, AMD and Qualcomm rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) for their chips. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) shares have gained about 52% so far this year.\n\nThird Point Management stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we added to our Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) investment, which we initiated in May of last year. TSMC is coming off its worst year since the Global Financial Crisis, and in the years to come we see a combination of cyclical recovery plus structural growth in AI demand fueling substantial earnings growth for the company.\n\nWe view TSMC as the “toll road” of the semiconductor industry, particularly for AI compute. TSMC holds more than 90% market share for leading edge semiconductor manufacturing, where all AI silicon is being processed. Beyond their reliable execution producing some of the most complex products on earth in volume, TSMC has spent decades optimizing for and building ecosystems around their 500+ customers, an advantage that cannot be replicated overnight…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before the June 7 Stock Split?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, and this has helped earnings to climb in the triple digits in recent years. AI may be the hottest investment theme right now, and this could continue. After all, analysts say the AI market could be worth more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. So it's no surprise that Nvidia shares have skyrocketed, advancing 600% over the past three years.\n\nThis momentum helped push Nvidia shares to nearly $1,000 in recent times. And they actually surpassed that level after the company announced another blowout quarter, along with a move many investors had been hoping for: a stock split.\n\nThis will significantly lower the price of each Nvidia share. The big question is: Should you buy Nvidia stock before the June 7 stock split or wait until you can get shares at the lower price? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLowering the price of each share\n\nFirst, let's talk about stock splits, in general. They don't change the market value of a company or the value of your holding if you already own the shares. Instead, a stock split will lower the price of each share by offering more shares to current holders. The ratio of the split determines the number of shares each investor will receive.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, it's a 10-for-1 stock split, so for every one share you hold, you'll get an extra nine. At today's price of about $1,139, each individual share will now sell for $113. You'll have to be a shareholder of record as of June 6 to benefit, and the extra shares will be distributed after the market close on June 7.\n\nShould you get in on Nvidia before or after this much-awaited stock split? The short answer is it doesn't matter, and here's why. As mentioned earlier, a stock split doesn't change the value of the company or the value of an investor's holding. If you buy one share today or 10 shares after the split, you'll be investing the same amount of cash.\n\nAlso, stock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share performance since they're just mechanical movements -- so Nvidia shares aren't likely to soar the day after the split just because a split occurred. Any potential gains, which could come either now or post-split, probably would be linked to the company's recent earnings performance or future growth prospects.\n\nOpening the door to a broader range of investors\n\nThe split is positive for Nvidia because it offers a broader range of investors access to the stock, and the company even stated that as its reason for launching the operation. Yes, fractional shares exist, but certain brokerages don't offer them, and some investors prefer buying full shares. That doesn't mean a huge wave of new investors will buy Nvidia shares post-split, but over time, a lower per-share price could attract more investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow let's get back to you. If you want to bet on a current and future leader in the AI space, Nvidia makes an excellent buy (now or post-split). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the key AI tasks of training and inferencing -- and more. And demand for Nvidia's chips and systems is so high, the company says it's \"racing\" to keep up.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is set to release its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever later this year. And the company pledges to update its top-performing chips annually. This will make it very difficult for rivals to unseat this market giant.\n\nThough we all tend to look at a stock price and immediately think \"that's cheap\" or \"that's expensive,\" it's important to instead look at valuation, or what the stock really is worth. Today, Nvidia trades at 42x forward earnings estimates, which looks reasonable, considering the company's market position and growth prospects.\n\nNvidia makes a great buy and could offer you explosive growth over time -- whether you buy the stock before or after the upcoming stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Take advantage of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) investor enthusiasm with these under-the-radar stocks. The chip giant’s latest quarterly revenues were $26 billion, 262% more than last year, and net earnings were $14.9 billion, which was beyond expectations. Nvidia achieved record earnings due to increasing demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products and data center operations.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia’s stock went through the roof, rising 24% to a new high. This increase affected the tech industry, which helped explain why the market value of AI-focused tech companies increased by about $300 billion. Moreover, another sign of its importance was that Nvidia’s growth greatly improved S&P 500 earnings over the previous year.\n\nThe S&P 500, for example, had its best first quarter since 2019 — it went up 10.2% — thanks to the success of big tech and AI companies like Nvidia, which made a lot of money. In the same quarter, the Nasdaq Composite also went up by 9.29%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith three rate cuts possible in 2024, now seems like the best time to buy some under-the-radar stocks that are cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio higher than 78% of its industry.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) IBM Q System One Quantum Computer at the Consumer Electronic Show CES 2020. Quantum computing stocks.\n\nSource: Boykov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is involved in one of the economy’s hottest growth sectors: quantum computing. As part of a market with the potential to reach over $93 billion by 2040, it comes as no surprise that RGTI boasts a whopping 196% potential upside.\n\nMore recently, RGTI reached 99.3% median 2-qubit gate reliability on a 9-qubit system in the first quarter. It hopes to expand this to the 84-qubit Ankaa 3 system by the end of the year and build a 336-qubit system called Lyra.\n\nAnother milestone for RGTI was the first Novera QPU sale to Horizon Quantum Computing in Singapore. In 2025, the technology will link Rigetti’s quantum processor to Quantum Machines’ OPX1000 processor-based quantum interface.\n\nIn addition, RGTI won a competition run by Innovate UK to give the National Quantum Computer Centre (NQCC) a 24-qubit quantum computer machine built on its Ankaa-class design.\n\n​Rigetti and Oxford Instrumentsalso recently announced the completion of a three-year project to build and run one of the UK’s first quantum computers.\n\nHowever, Rigetti needs to start performing better financially; it reported Q1 2024 sales of $3.1 million, up from $2.2 million. Revenue rose, but the firm lost $20.8 million. On the bright side, Rigetti’s ATM campaign generated $32.9 million, bringing its end-of-quarter liquidity to $102.8 million, expected to finance operations until mid-2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nOddity Tech (ODD) AI Artificial Intelligence.

AI stocks\n\nSource: Tapati Rinchumrus / Shutterstock.com\n\nOddity Tech’s (NASDAQ:ODD) first-quarter 2024 financial statistics showed strong growth and success. The firm beat consensus projections of 49 cents with 61 cents in earnings-per-share. Oddity Tech earned $212 million, an amount noticeably above its $205.14 million forecast.\n\nThe Israeli artificial intelligence-driven online platform reported healthy growth for its two main brands, IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild while stating that work on new brands in beauty and health areas is ongoing. At the same time, the balance sheet holds $252 million in cash and no debt.\n\nHowever, NINGI Research is alleging Oddity Tech defrauded investors. The report said that Oddity fraudulently claimed to be an online firm while having 43 storefronts and six beauty schools in Israel.\n\nOddity Tech rejects the charges, stating that its Israeli outlets account for less than 5% of net revenue and EBITDA. Ernst & Young audits all of its Israeli subsidiaries and guarantees its financial records and business strategy. Oddity Tech pledges transparency and client satisfaction.​\n\nHowever, the short-seller report makes it one of the best under-the-radar stocks, especially with its strong buy rating and over 44% upside.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) has made significant progress since the pandemic, thus, it’s no wonder analysts rate it a “strong buy,” with an over 28% upside. For 2024, it plans to add new sites and extend its summer flights on its international routes.\n\nUnited Airlines has announced its most summer flights ever, including new routes to Brussels, Malaga, Reykjavik, and Rome. United also installed eight local lines. Summer services are provided from Dulles International Airport to Palm Springs and Anchorage.\n\nFinancially, United Airlines’ stock price rose more than 17% after the firm forecast high second-quarter profits; the carrier expects to report $3.75–$4.25 per share, above Wall Street expectations.\n\nUnited had to revise its 2024 fleet plan because Boeing (NYSE:BA) still has quality issues. The airline now expects 61 narrow-body aircraft this year, down from 101. Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) A321neo planes will be leased in the future.\n\nUnited CEO Scott Kirby said the company has adjusted its fleet strategy to manufacturer supply. Notwithstanding these adjustments, United remains confident in its $9 to $11 per share annual profits prediction.\n\nFinally, Fitch Ratings recently upgraded United Airlines’ ratings, citing improving credit metrics; UAL concluded Q4 2023 with $14.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.75 billion under its revolver, protecting against the downside, placing it well among under-the-radar stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Hypergrowth Hits: 3 Stocks Clocking Triple-Digit Gains with No End in Sight",
        "content": "Hypergrowth stocks are the holy grail of traders and growth investors. These stocks can multiply a small position by two, five, 10 times, or more. In many cases, analysts like to project what stocks they believe can deliver this kind of market-beating performance in the future.\n\nHowever, this article analyzes three stocks that have posted a 100% or higher increase in share price over the last 12 months. Past results don’t always equate to future performance. And it’s fair to note that many hypergrowth stocks can’t sustain that return over time. Many have even failed. However, each stock on this list appears likely to move even higher.\n\nYou’ll notice that none of these stocks is named Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The Magnificent 7 stock could have easily made this list, but it seems too easy. Instead, the hypergrowth stocks on this list may be able to give you Nvidia-like gains but for, perhaps, far less investment capital.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs noted, Nvidia is not on this list, but that doesn’t mean we ignored the chip sector altogether. ACM Research (NYSE:ACMR) is a picks-and-shovels play on the likely rise in semiconductor stocks. This growth isn’t just due to Nvidia’s strong earnings report. Advanced semiconductor chips are going to be essential to the growing AI economy.\n\nACM Research is the leading provider of semiconductor cleaning equipment essential in manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips. Specifically, the company handles wafer cleaning, a market that experts believe will achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% through 2030, promoting a valuation of $5.77 billion. In 2023, ACM had over $557 million in revenue, about 13% of the total market valuation of $4.23 billion.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company nearly doubled its revenue on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. However, ACM stock is down 16.5% in the month following its earnings report. That may be due to the softness in the wafer fab equipment market, which is expected to continue this year before picking up in 2025.\n\nTidewater (TDW) A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. top growth stocks\n\nSource: MEE KO DONG / Shutterstock\n\nThe next of these hypergrowth stocks comes from the energy sector. Tidewater (NYSE:TDW) operates a fleet of marine service vessels supporting the energy industry’s exploration and production efforts. Capital expenditures in this sector are expected to grow significantly in the coming years as global oil production will increase due to rising demand.\n\nTDW stock has been up 118% in the last 12 months and will be up 42.5% in 2024. That’s notable because the first quarter is historically the company’s slowest quarter from an activity perspective – by the company’s admission. Yet Tidewater delivered YOY revenue growth of 66% in the quarter, and earnings were up a whopping 286% YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts have a consensus price target of $119.83, 16.5% higher than its closing price on May 24, 2024. However, BTIG Research has reiterated its Buy rating on TDW stock since the company’s earnings report and raised its price target from $110 to $130.\n\nContext Therapeutics (CNTX) Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock\n\nContext Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CNTX) is a pre-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company in the early stages of developing drugs to combat solid tumors. In early May 2024, the company received FDA clearance for its IND application to bring its CTIM-76 candidate into Phase 1 clinical trials. CTIM-76 is “a promising Claudin 6 (CLDNG) x CD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody.”\n\nIt’s not unusual to see biopharmaceutical companies on a list of hypergrowth stocks. That’s because all it takes is one blockbuster drug to send revenue soaring and turn unprofitable stocks profitable. On the other hand, many of these companies never make it through the clinical trial stage.\n\nHowever, in May 2024, Context also completed a private placement that netted the company gross proceeds of approximately $100 million. This will allow the company to begin the Phase 1 trial.\n\nCNTX stock has been up 138% in the last 12 months, but investors should remember that this is still a penny stock that trades for just $2 a share. It’s not only unprofitable, but the company is still in the pre-revenue stage. Like many penny stocks, it doesn’t receive much analyst coverage, but the three analysts that have issued price targets have a consensus price of $6.50, which would be a 225% gain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Hypergrowth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "You might not realize it, but one of the most important data releases of the quarter occurred roughly two weeks ago. On May 15, institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn simple terms, a 13F gives investors over-the-shoulder access to Wall Street's brightest investment minds. Though the data can be delayed by more than six weeks, it provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's top investors bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, 13Fs detailed trading activity for the first quarter). These filings can be especially useful in identifying which stocks, sectors, industries, and innovations asset managers are buying into or avoiding. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe latest round of 13Fs show that billionaires were busy bees during the first quarter. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite pushing to fresh all-time highs, billionaires chose to pile into two hypergrowth stocks. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that one of the fastest scaling companies on the planet, artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), was given the heave-ho by billionaire investors.\n\nMore than a half-dozen billionaires dumped shares of Nvidia\n\nFollowing the release of its fiscal first-quarter operating results (ended April 28), shares of Nvidia have rocketed higher by 115% on a year-to-date basis, and gained more than $2.2 trillion in market value since the start of 2023. However, this didn't stop eight prominent billionaire investors from heading to the exit during the March-ended quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nThe three likeliest reasons these successful billionaires bid adieu to a portion of their respective Nvidia stakes likely boils down to three factors: history, pricing power, and competition.\n\nWith regard to the former, there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation in three decades where investors didn't overestimate the uptake/adoption of said innovation. Whether it was the internet, business-to-business commerce, genome decoding, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology, or the metaverse, investors continually overshoot the when it comes to the adoption or application of new innovations. While artificial intelligence can be wildly successful over the long run, there's a high probability we're witnessing yet another early stage bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Nvidia is on the cusp of contending with a surge of hardware competition in high-compute data centers. Intel is readying to release its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator during the third quarter, while Advanced Micro Devices has been steadily ramping the release of its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nThe concern with this external competition is that it'll reduce the scarcity that's helped push the selling price of Nvidia's H100 GPUs into the stratosphere. As the availability of AI-GPUs improves, Nvidia's pricing power should wane. This might explain why Nvidia's fiscal second-quarter guidance calls for its gross margin to contract by 235 to 335 basis points from the sequential first quarter.\n\nLastly, Nvidia could see increased competition for AI-accelerated data center space from its top customers. Nvidia's four largest customers make up about 40% of its net sales, and they're all currently developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these in-house chips are used in a complementary fashion, it potentially marks a top in gross margin and scaling for this $2.6 trillion AI juggernaut.\n\nBut while billionaires were selling shares of Nvidia, they were piling into the following two hypergrowth stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOkta\n\nThe first fast-paced stock that had the undivided attention of billionaire money managers as they were pressing the sell button on Nvidia is cybersecurity company Okta(NASDAQ: OKTA). Five top-tier billionaires -- six, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- opened or added to their positions in Okta during the March-ended quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (278,971 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (274,832 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (133,918 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (22,996 shares)\n\nOkta endured a challenging end to 2023 after it had to admit that hackers had breached its platform and gained access to sensitive information. It's not uncommon for cybersecurity companies to stumble for a couple of quarters following such an admission. However, billionaires believe there's quite the value proposition with this rapidly growing security company.\n\nWhat makes Okta tick is its cloud-native, AI and machine learning-driven cybersecurity platform. While it still needs refining (as evidenced by the October breach), a cloud-based, AI-driven identity verification platform has the ability to become more efficient at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time, and is far nimbler than on-premises solutions.\n\nWhat billionaires likely appreciate about Okta is its subscription-fueled operating model. Subscriptions generate predictable operating cash flow and high margins quarter after quarter. As of the end of fiscal 2024 (Jan. 31, 2024), Okta had nearly $3.4 billion in remaining performance obligations (essentially its subscription backlog) and enjoyed a gross profit margin of 74.3% for the full year, up 370 basis points from the previous year. As Okta scales, its gross margin should approach 80%.\n\nFurthermore, the company has moved past the high integration costs associated with its 2022 acquisition of Auth0. Buying Auth0 meaningfully expanded Okta's presence in the $30 billion Customer Identity market, and gives the company a clear path to sell its solutions beyond the borders of the U.S.\n\nOver the coming four years, Okta's earnings growth rate could double up its sales growth.\n\nDatadog\n\nThe second hypergrowth stock that billionaires couldn't stop buying in the March-ended quarter as they were sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is cloud-based observability company Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG). Similar to Okta, five billionaires took the plunge in the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,076,411 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,053,632 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (873,186 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (93,409 shares)\n\nThe biggest challenge a company like Datadog has faced over the past year is the prospect of a U.S. recession. A couple of predictive indicators, such as the first decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, signal a real likelihood of a recession in the not-too-distant future. It's not uncommon for fast-growing businesses to pare back their capital spending during short-lived economic downturns.\n\nThankfully, the U.S. economy has remained strong, which has fueled macro and company-specific catalysts for Datadog.\n\nOn a macro basis, the permanent shift we've witnessed in the labor force following the COVID-19 pandemic has worked in Datadog's favor. With a hybrid work environment -- i.e., a mix of office-based and mobile employees -- Datadog's platforms are being counted on more than ever to observe and secure data flows and user activity within the cloud.\n\nOne of the company's primary growth drivers is enterprise cloud spending. In 2019, approximately 5% of all global information technology (IT) spending was for the cloud. By 2027, closer to 20% of global enterprise IT spending is estimated to be spent on the cloud. Datadog has a sustained double-digit growth runway as businesses ramp their push into the cloud.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Okta right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Okta, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Okta wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 lesser-known, under-the-radar AI stocks hedge funds are piling into. Since RXRX is part of the list, the stock deserves a deeper look.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals is an NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) partner that will use the semiconductor giant's chips and technology for drug discovery. The NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) \"effect\" is now causing many stocks to create buzz in the market, while many analysts believe NVDA shares themselves are overvalued. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nThe AI-led stock rally that rewarded mega-cap technology stocks has finally started to trickle down to other industry players that were seemingly not related to the AI and tech industry. Consider this: The information technology sector gained about 11% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 utilities sector jumped 18% in the same period. Why? Because investors are scrambling to pile into utilities since they are set to benefit from the dramatic rise in power demand thanks to the data center boom caused by the mass AI adaption. As Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang put it in the company's latest earnings call, the \"next industrial revolution\" has started with the dawn of AI and across the globe data centers are being \"converted into AI factories.\"\n\nA Wall Street Journal report recently quoted Nadia Lovell, senior U.S. equity strategist, global wealth management at UBS, who said that the market is \"no longer dependent on just one stock\" when it comes to AI as she sees a \"broadening out of the AI trade.\"\n\nInsider Monkey's research backs this notion. Our research recently unlocked several AI stocks that are better than mega-cap AI stocks with soaring valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nFor this article we first conducted thorough research to see which lesser-known companies are offering products and services set to see demand in the AI revolution. These companies included firms making hardware, software, infrastructure and backend products necessary for mass AI deployment and consumption. From these companies we chose 7 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Austin Distel on Unsplash\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nAI-based drug discovery is one of the biggest trends major companies and venture capitalists are betting on. Some estimates suggest AI-led drug discovery could soon be a $100 billion business. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) is an AI drug discovery play, as Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) uses high-dimensional data and predictive results for drug discovery and development. Last year, Nvidia decided to invest $50 million in Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) in a partnership that would see the combination of Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc's (NASDAQ:RXRX) chemical and biological datasets with NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud and other AI tech stack for drug discovery.\n\nAs of the end of the first quarter of 2024, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX). The biggest stakeholder of Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) during this period was Catherine D. Wood's ARK Investment Management which had a $245 million stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX).\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) ranks 6th in Insider Monkey’s list of the 7 Best Under-The-Radar AI Stocks Hedge Funds are Buying.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Evercore ISI argued in a Wednesday note to clients that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is no longer the linchpin of the stock market, despite its remarkable post-earnings rally.\n\nFollowing Nvidia's earnings report on May 22, the AI stock surged nearly 20% in three days, a move that historically would have lifted the S&P 500. However, this time the S&P 500 remained down, marking an unprecedented decoupling.\n\n“While there have been several instances of “important” stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) or NVDA rising 20% in 3 days, either the shares were not yet a top 5 weight stock in the S&P 500 or those rallies moved the S&P 500 higher in tandem,” Evercore analysts wrote.\n\n“SPX never down simultaneous to a 20%+ advance after an Earnings release,” they added.\n\nThe divergence is particularly striking given Nvidia's high correlation with the S&P 500, which stood at 0.95 over the past year, and happening on May 28, when the implied correlation among large-cap stocks tumbled to 12.04, among the lowest in history.\n\nThis, according to Evercore, further reinforces the notion of a \"stockpicker's market.\" Historically, such troughs in correlation have led to significant market corrections, yet the recent period has been an exception.\n\nThe 3-day surge of NVDA while the S&P 500 fell “is a catalyst for greater movement at the S&P 500 level ahead of other event catalysts,” continued Evercore analysts. These catalysts include the upcoming Trump trial verdict, core PCE inflation report, Nvidia’s stock split, CPI report, and the FOMC meeting next month.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvercore ISI: Nvidia is no longer 'the stock that is the market'\n\nHow China's EV makers aim to beat Tesla, legacy automakers in Europe\n\nEuropean stocks largely lower; key inflation data looms\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Major U.S. indices are coming off a strong performance quarter following surging gains of large-cap technology stocks fueling the bull market. Despite the slight drawback in recent weeks, Wall Street analysts are positive that there’s still enough steam left in the engines before indices could experience a retraction.\n\nTech Holding Steady\n\nOn Monday, May 20 indices across the market were pursuing new records as the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.65%, reaching an intra-day record high of 16,794.87. The broader S&P 500 furthered its winning streak, gaining 0.09% and ending the trading day at 5,309.13.\n\nOn Wall Street, all eyes were on the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had caught investors off guard following its breakout performance on Friday, May 17. The Dow ended the trading day above 40,000, a new record for the 30-stock index and the first time in its nearly 128-year history.\n\nAfter the weekend, however, the Dow Jones slightly retreated, falling 196.82 points on May 20, and closing off at 39,806.77.\n\nThough retraction levels are somewhat superficial at this time, investors are hot on the heels of large-cap technology stocks and companies that are expected to begin delivering earnings results in the following weeks.\n\nThe next couple of weeks are set to be yet another eventful time on the stock market as major players such as AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are expected to deliver earnings. Company stocks gained 2% on May 20, as investors and analysts raised their pricing positions ahead of its earnings report.\n\nNvidia continues to push beyond the glass ceiling, with stocks up more than 96% since the turn of the year and already gaining more than 206% in the last 12 months. The tech and chip titan is now the third-largest on the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion.\n\nThough elsewhere, broader economic performance continues to remain volatile despite U.S. inflation trending downwards and domestic demand for products and services cools. Inflation data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in April with CPI rising 3.4% year on year, Reuters reported.\n\nSticky inflation and wage growth have left the Federal Reserve’s decision unchanged about cutting interest rates any time soon, with the federal fund rate still sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%. A potential rate cut is expected near the end of summer, as the central bank continues to gauge inflation, employment, and wage growth as key decision-makers before losing their monetary policy. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nNew York Wall Street sign.\n\nLooking Towards Diversifying\n\nThe overactive market conditions are bringing new and old investors to consider other possibilities that could provide them with broader diversification in the tech sector. As the competition among large-cap companies continues to swell, those looking to hold a safer position could instead be looking at tech exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an opportunity to gain market share and further diversify their holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroad tech ETFs are a corner of the market that has received major attention in recent years, with holdings in companies that are directly involved in the technology industry, including networking, software, hardware, semiconductors, social media, search engine marketing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of five broad tech ETFs to keep on your radar this year.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF\n\n5G connectivity is taking off at full speed despite being only in the beginning stages of its lifecycle. An Ericsson Mobility Report found that more than 1.6 billion 5G smartphone subscriptions were active by the end of 2023 with a projected two billion to be active by the end of this year.\n\nThe exceptional growth of the market has meant that mobile service providers are quickly catching wind of these developments and looking to leverage larger market opportunities in the coming years.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG) shows that 5G technology and connectivity aren’t only essential for everyday communication but instead provide a stable investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their portfolios into this seemingly untapped market.\n\nThe fund has roughly 53 holdings, offering investors transparent exposure to 5G stocks and companies engaged in connectivity services, development, research, and commercialization. The underlying index tracks 48 globally-listed stocks with various market capitalizations.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, the fund has held steady, offering a 21.68% one-year return, and roughly 9.15% since inception. Total return (NAV) is slightly in line with broader market performance, with year-to-date returns of 2.77%, as of May 2024.\n\nA diverse fund holding ensures that investors obtain the necessary exposure to large-cap technology and network stocks, with iPhone maker, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) having the top spot, with 5.67% of the fund invested in Apple shares.\n\nOther notable holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n\nThe Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF is more than a fund directed at network mobility. Instead, Defiance claims that this fund allows investors to gain traction in a rapidly growing industry that’s connected to more than mobile devices, but instead sees some of its biggest customers being in healthcare, finance, and data generation.\n\niShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) is a broad technology fund with roughly 278 holdings in North American equities. The objective of the fund is to provide investors with more diversified exposure to North American equities and companies operating in the technology sector, including communication services and the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nOn top of this, the fund manages several holdings related to hardware, software, internet marketing, and interactive media. Overall, the Expanded Tech Sector ETF aims to provide North American and international investors with an expressed view of advanced technology companies and the broader tech sector.\n\nBased on current performance data, the iShares Extended Tech Sector ETF has gained roughly 10.59 since its inception back in 2001. One year total return is currently standing at 52.97%, which for some investors might seem outlandish considering the fund's broad exposure to various capital sectors.\n\nThe staggering performance of the fund can be largely attributed to its ability to invest in a large quantity of diverse tech and software companies. At the top of the list, companies such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) make up the largest portion of fund distributions.\n\nOutside of investing in major tech companies, most of which are part of the Magnificent Seven, the fund has much of its distributions held up in the semiconductor and interactive media services, investing 24.0% and 19.31% of the fund, respectively. Other sectors of importance include application and system software, and lesser-known services such as IT consulting and communication equipment.\n\nSince the turn of the year, the fund has gained 17.73%, while the broader S&P 500 has risen 11.29% YTD, and the S&P 500 Information Technology index is up by 16.24% YTD.\n\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\n\nAnother suitable option for investors looking to invest in large-cap high-tech companies is the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) which invests in the top 7 tech stocks and provides investors with more exposure to heavy-weight competitors.\n\nFor investors that are not yet aware, the Magnificent Seven is the collective name given to the largest, and most prominent tech companies and includes Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nIn the last couple of years, these seven trailblazing companies have helped push technology stocks to new heights, and the widespread development of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the next generation of tech and software developers.\n\nMAGS offers investors pure exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, reducing direct volatile risk exposure and weighting out portfolio distribution. On average, distribution holdings are fairly equal, although currently 16.36% is invested in Alphabet Class A shares, with Meta Platforms taking the bottom position with 12.61% fund allocation.\n\nThough the fund offers direct pure exposure to mega-cap tech stocks, seasoned professionals might be skeptical about the long-term viability of MAGS. For starters, the fund is relatively new, coming onto the market in November 2023, meaning that many investors still have limited amounts of data to clearly define their forward-looking position of the fund.\n\nSecondly, the fund solely holds seven stocks, meaning that risk distribution to return potential is seemingly higher, and can be considered a drawback for older, more seasoned investors that are looking to lower these risks and direct capital towards more buoyant long-term options.\n\nFinally, a principal investment strategy of MAGS is to invest at least 80% of its assets, including borrowings for investment purposes in the financial instruments of its holdings that provide the best exposure, or a combination of economic characteristics.\n\nThis could mean that should one of its holdings, or several others experience a significant decline in revenue, profit, market share, or market capitalization, the fund could then possibly experience declined near-term returns.\n\nThough it’s an ambitious technology fund that gives the best possible exposure to the Magnificent Seven, perhaps investors who are looking to reduce risks and mitigate near-term volatility would be best suited to opt for something more geared towards their forward-looking goals.\n\nVanEck Robotics ETF\n\nOn paper, the VanECK Robotics ETF (IBOT) offers a multi-dynamic investment opportunity that sees the fund invest in large-scale technological projects and developments supported by global market demand.\n\nIBOT exposure is directed toward high-growth companies, the majority focusing on future industrial automation and technological acceleration. Based on current data, IBOT invests the majority of its capital in the information technology sector, followed by industrial and consumer discretionary. Other, smaller holdings are focused on healthcare, energy, and cash.\n\nThe fund aims to replicate the performance of the BlueState Robotics Index which tracks companies that are closely involved in the field of robotics research and development.\n\nOverall, the BlueStar Robotics Index has held steady performance, with the index rising 23.45% over the past 12 months. The BlueStar Robotics Index has distributions across the world, investing in highly developed and high-growth capital markets, including the U.S., Japan, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, among other countries.\n\nSince its inception back in April 2023, the VanEck robotics fund has gained roughly 21.39%, slightly below the 22.16% return reported by the BlueStar Robotics Index during the same period. However, a yearly return is currently reported at 22.17%, which could give a positive indication for investors looking to actively leverage the robotics industry.\n\nIn a report by the International Federation of Robotics, recent data showed that in 2023, manufacturing companies across the world, and primarily in the U.S. have heavily invested in production line and supply chain automation. During the period, robotic installations rose by 12%, reaching more than 44,300 units in 2023, with the automotive industry being the top adopter of automation and robotic equipment.\n\nOn the back of surging growth and demand, IBOT could be the link investors need to tap into the marketing of automation and robotic equipment. With both the private and public sectors now plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into the world of robotics automation, IBOT could perhaps be the turning point for novice and seasoned investors.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nLast on the list is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) which aims to track the performance of a benchmark index through passively managed strategies, including a full-replication strategy when possible.\n\nAs the name suggests, VGT is focused on investment movement within the information technology sector with 27.60% of its weighted exposure allocated to the semiconductor sector. The systems software sector follows second, making up 22.90% of the fund, and technology hardware, storage, and peripherals take up 17.30%.\n\nAlthough these are only three of the primary sectors the fund is invested in, holdings such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Cisco Systems, and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) are among the 313 other companies that make up the broader diversification of VGT.\n\nFor the physical year-end 31 August 2023, Vanguard Information Technology ETF reported a strong turnover rate of 15.4%, while the fund currently has an earnings growth rate of 2.07%, according to recent fund information.\n\nOther performance data indicates that VGT managed to slightly outperform the benchmark one-year performance rate. VGT reported a 12-month return of 29.70%, while the benchmark return was 29.66%.\n\nFor investors who are seeking more weighted security and direct exposure to the domestic information technology sector, VGT is considered a reasonably safer option for long-term opportunities and provides a seemingly secure holdings distribution.\n\nRiding Out Uncertainty\n\nAs the bull run is expected to extend well into the coming months, looking toward the technology sector for better portfolio and performance buoyancy is becoming a sure strategic decision for investors and Wall Street investment firms.\n\nAlthough uncertainty continues to loom overhead, with geopolitical tension and tight interest rates keeping some investors at bay, those seeking to leverage current market conditions are holding steady on technology stocks and ETFs due to a positive turnaround in the market.\n\nArguably, conditions are looking surprisingly positive for both ends of the spectrum. The S&P 500 Information Technology index is above the broader S&P 500, gaining 16.24% compared to 11.29% year to date. On a quarterly basis, similar conditions are playing out, as the S&P tech sector index gained 3.34% compared to 1.02% on the S&P.\n\nMarket conditions are piping hot, and investors aren’t taking a backseat anytime soon. Yet, broader economic conditions and the possibility of a hard landing remain deciding factors for some seasoned investors who are hoping to ride out near-term volatility.\n\nFinishing Thoughts\n\nTechnology is rapidly changing the way we work and communicate, and the companies spearheading the race to innovation are casting a bright light on new opportunities on the stock market.\n\nThough there is still a lot of uncertainty up ahead, both in relation to macroeconomic conditions and the global political environment, investors should consider seeking out investments, and diverse funds that not only provide stability but offer them the necessary long and near-term broad exposure in advanced tech sectors that can ride out uncertainty,m while providing sufficient portfolio buoyancy.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: I recently initiated a small position in Tesla, no other positions in any other positions mentioned.\n\nRelated Content\n\n10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now Should You Hold Nvidia (NVDA)?

        "content": "Shares of NVIDIA NVDA, arguably the most important company in the world today, have surged more than 135% this year, following a nearly 240% increase in 2023.\n\nThe company reported impressive results last week, exceeding sky high expectations as demand for its AI chips continues to grow exponentially.\n\nDeep-pocketed clients, particularly tech giants Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL as well as well-funded AI startups, are scrambling for NVIDIA's GPUs as the AI race heats up.\n\nNVIDIA currently controls over 80% of the market for cutting-edge chips used to train and run large language models. The biggest question for investors now is whether this dominance can be sustained and for how long.\n\nWhile NVIDIA's GPUs are unmatched for training AI models, chips from competitors like Intel and AMD can be used for inference after models are trained.\n\nNVIDIA appears to have a strong position in the inference market as well, but it could face increased competition in the coming years. Additionally, large technology companies are designing their own chips, potentially reducing their reliance on NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA's chips are already significantly ahead of the competition, with the company planning to launch even more improved chips annually.\n\nWhat truly sets NVIDIA apart is its comprehensive AI ecosystem, which includes its CUDA software and leading networking technology.\n\nNVIDIA has invested heavily in CUDA for over almost two decades, and boasts the best chip networking technology thanks to its acquisition of Mellanox in 2019.\n\nAny rival aiming to gain dominance in the industry will need to develop best-in-class hardware, software, and networking technology, a significant challenge.\n\nFurthermore, NVIDIA has access to a large share of TSMC's TSM advanced manufacturing capabilities, making it difficult for competitors to secure similar allocations.\n\nPlease watch the short video to learn more.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The latest Nvidia Corp. frenzy is fueling an unprecedented rally in the booming industry of leveraged-up ETFs as retail traders go all-in on the world’s “most important stock.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Wall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers\n\nA GraniteShares fund, which gives investors two times the daily return of the Jensen Huang-run company, is now up 450% over the past year, with a record $4.7 billion in trading volume last week. The $2.8 billion GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (ticker NVDL) launched in December 2022.\n\nNvidia, the posterchild of the artificial intelligence craze, is fueling the bull market to multiple records with the now $2.8 trillion chipmaker posting a fresh blockbuster earnings report as bullish call options boom. On the flipside, bears have got crushed with the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD), which tracks the daily inverse return of the underlying stock, down 86% this year alone.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Stock Surge Fueled by Short-Dated Call Option Squeeze\n\nWith speculative euphoria running wild in markets, the creator behind the amped-up products is prepping an avalanche of new options-fueled strategies tracking everything from gold and Big Tech to Bitcoin.\n\nPut another way, Nvidia is increasingly the new Tesla Inc. as tech-bullish retail traders pounce on new ETF strategies.\n\n“If we were having this conversation three years ago, I would say we’d be talking exclusively about Tesla. That was where the enthusiasm was. That’s where all the flows were,” Will Rhind, chief executive officer of GraniteShares, said on Bloomberg Television’s ETF IQ. “Now, obviously the whole conversation is dominated by Nvidia that is why I think Nvidia is the most important stock in the world right now. And it goes without saying we got an ecosystem around Nvidia.”\n\nLeveraged funds have gained favor this year, amassing $11 billion of inflows so far, on track to keep pace with last year’s $20 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Demand for this breed of funds has increased as investors seek new vehicles to bet on the market’s biggest themes. But they have also garnered mixed reviews due in part for exposing retail traders — who are often dubbed as less sophisticated than institutional ones — to high risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nGraniteShares has filed for at least 25 ETFs that track the performance of other single-stock ETFs that have daily 2x and 3x leveraged strategies.\n\n“What we are providing is institutionally priced leverage to the masses — that’s the big breakthrough,” he added. “With leverage comes risk and these products are not without risk.”\n\n--With assistance from Denitsa Tsekova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley When Business Is Just a Game The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "On Wall Street, reality may blur with the virtual, while investors search for top metaverse stocks.\n\nThe metaverse refers to a virtual world where users can interact, play and socialize in an immersive and interactive environment. With the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, the metaverse is poised to revolutionize the way we live, work and play. The segment is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 41%.\n\nAs the metaverse continues to evolve, investors are seeking exposure to the companies driving this innovation with cutting-edge technologies, platforms and experiences. From gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare, the metaverse has the potential to transform industries and create new growth opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s delve into three top metaverse stocks to buy that are paving the way for a new era of immersive digital engagement.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is a leading innovator in haptics technology, which allows users to experience realistic touch sensations through digital devices. IMMR develops haptic feedback solutions across various industries. Those include mobile phones, automotive user interfaces and gaming peripherals. Their comprehensive portfolio enables manufacturers to integrate immersive touch feedback into their products.\n\nThe haptics technology innovator reported stellar financial results for the first quarter in April. Total revenue soared to $43.8 million, a dramatic 520% year-over-year (YOY) increase from $7.1 million. This robust performance significantly surpassed analyst estimates of $24.94 million. Net income climbed to $19.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $9.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nImmersion inked significant licensing deals in the first quarter of 2024, solidifying its market position. A February agreement granted Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) access to Immersion’s haptics patents for their hardware, software, VR, and gaming products. This deal highlighted the growing role of haptics in the metaverse. Additionally, Immersion renewed its licensing agreement with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) in March, ensuring continued use of their technology in Nintendo’s gaming products.\n\nAs a result, IMMR stock has gained 38% year-to-date (YTD), reaching multi-year highs. Shares are trading at an attractive 8.2x forward earnings and 4.4x sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $10.50 for IMMR, signaling roughly a 10% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a real-time 3D development platform where creators can build interactive experiences. In fact, Unity’s reach extends far beyond video games. It allows a diverse set of creators to develop VR applications, architectural visualizations and automotive design simulations as well.\n\nYet, the 3D platform developer recently reported mixed financial results. Total revenues declined 8% YOY to $460.4 million, yet beat analyst estimates by 6%. Diluted net loss per share widened 12% to came in at 75 cents, higher than anticipated.\n\nIn a move poised to revolutionize the in-cabin car experience, Unity and Mazda Motor (OTCMKTS:MZDAY) have recently forged a strategic partnership. This collaboration will leverage Unity’s development platform to create a next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) and graphic user interface (GUI) for future Mazda vehicles.\n\nSo far in 2024, U stock has plunged close to 50%, while the stock is currently trading at 3.7 times sales. Yet, Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of U stock with a price forecast of $26, an upside of 25%. Interested investors could regard declines below $19 as opportunity to initiate positions in U shares.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nThe last top metaverse stock is the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pure-play for investing in businesses at the forefront of the metaverse market. These companies might be involved in hardware (VR headsets, haptic technology) and software development (game engines, 3D creation tools). In addition, networking infrastructure and even payment solutions that will facilitate transactions within virtual worlds enter the domain of the fund.\n\nMETV, which has 38 holdings, was launched in June 2021. The top 10 names make up about 50% of net assets of $406 million. In terms of sectors, we see gaming platform (22%) followed by computing components (19%), cloud solutions (14.9%) and video games (11.6%). About 70% of the companies are U.S.-based. Others come from China (8.7%), Japan (6.7%), South Korea (6.0%) and others. Leading holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); Roblox (NYSE:ROBLOX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nSince January, METV has returned around 10%, and recently hit a 2-year high. Yet, the current valuation appears favorable with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1x . Investors looking to capitalize on the next iteration of the internet can find the METV ETF a compelling option. Finally, potential investors should also note the expense ratio of 0.59%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "4 ETF Areas Hovering Around 52-Week Highs",
        "content": "Wall Street has been hovering around a record high and witnessing remarkable growth across various sectors, with several growth ETFs reaching or nearing their 52-week highs. This trend indicates a broad-based recovery and investor confidence in specific market segments.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore four key ETF areas that are currently shining: Semiconductor, Shipping, Nordic Region and Taiwan. These ETFs not only reflect robust market performance but also present intriguing opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on prevailing market trends.\n\nLet's delve a little deeper.\n\nSemiconductor\n\nStrive U.S. SemiconductorETF SHOC – Up 3.1% on May 28\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH – Up 2.3%\n\nInvesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ – Up 2.1%\n\nOn Tuesday, chipmaker NVIDIA’s NVDA stock surged above $1,100 for the first time, reaching a new milestone. Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, announced on Sunday that it had successfully raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round. Reports suggest that Elon Musk intends to deploy NVIDIA chips for a new \"supercomputer\" aimed at powering xAI's chatbot named Grok. This news sent the NVIDIA stock and NVIDIA ETFs like SHOC, SMH and SOXQ soaring.\n\nShipping\n\nU.S. Global Sea to Sky Cargo ETF SEA – Up 2.9%\n\nSonicShares Global Shipping ETF BOAT – Up 2.4%\n\nShipping stocks have recently surged to new highs, but their long-term performance is even more remarkable. Over the past five years, larger-cap shipping stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 by a factor of two to 10.\n\nAs a result, insider wealth from shipping ownership has increased by hundreds of millions of dollars. Geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea, a crucial area for international trade, have sparked a significant shift in the shipping industry, which offered a bullish case for global shipping stocks.\n\nNordic Region\n\nNorway iShares MSCI ETF ENOR – Up 1.7%\n\nGlobal X FTSE Nordic Region ETF NORW – Up 1.4%\n\nEnergy stocks take about 30% of both funds and hence depend largely on oil price movements. On May 28, 2024, crude oil prices increased by more than $1 per barrel. This rise was driven by expectations that OPEC and its allies (OPEC+) will continue their current crude supply restrictions, along with a weaker U.S. dollar, which made oil more appealing to investors holding other currencies. United States Brent Oil Fund LP BNO has added 16.7% so far this year (as of May 28, 2024).\n\nTaiwan\n\nTaiwan Franklin FTSE ETF FLTW – Up 1.4%\n\nTaiwan iShares MSCI ETF EWT – Up 1.2%\n\nStory continues\n\nIn both the above-mentioned ETFs, information technology takes more than 60% exposure. The top companies of these two ETFs are Taiwan Semiconductor (a key beneficiary of the latest AI boom), Hon Hai Precision and Mediatek. Understandably, the flurry of AI investment has continued to boost optimism over Taiwanese Chip companies’ growth rates.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "NVIDIA in Rush to Overtake Apple: ETFs Set to Gain Further",
        "content": "NVIDIA NVDA has been on a solid run with no signs of a slowdown, driven by the flurry of continued artificial intelligence (AI) investments and blockbuster earnings. Its shares closed above the $1,100 milestone for the first time ever.\r\n\r\nLast trading at $1,139, the AI chipmaker, the world’s third-most valuable company, is now just $100 billion away in market value to overtake Apple AAPL in a major reshuffle of Wall Street's biggest players. NVIDIA's market capitalization reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, the second-most valuable company after Microsoft MSFT.\r\n\r\nInvestors seeking to tap the robust growth could consider ETFs having the largest allocation to this AI darling stock. These are Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF SHOC, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, Grizzle Growth ETF DARP, TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF LRNZ and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ.\n\nAI Boom\n\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of technology companies racing to build AI into their products and services. NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said, “The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.”\r\n\r\nThe latest catalyst driving NVIDIA is the billions of dollars funding into Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence start-up. Elon Musk announced that AI start-up xAI's supercomputer will run on NVIDIA technology (read: Why You Should Buy AI & Chip ETFs Post-NVIDIA Earnings).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth for the chip maker, along with its CUDA software platform and its exposure to the automotive market. Investors cheered CEO Jensen Huang’s comments regarding their latest chip, Blackwell, which is expected to be launched in the second half of the year.\n\nBlowout Earnings\n\nLast week, NVIDIA reported blowout first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein it topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled GPU chips. Its data center revenues skyrocketed 427% year over year to a record $22.6 billion, buoyed by the rapid adoption of AI technologies (read: AI Boom Bolsters NVIDIA's Q1 Growth: ETFs to Tap).\n\nStock Split: A Big Boost\n\nThe chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share. The stock split has sparked a retail frenzy as it will make NVIDIA shares more accessible to a wider range of investors, including the ones who make small trades, and increase liquidity. Also, it will likely pave the way for the company’s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the lower price could pave the way for the company’s inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Amazon AMZN joined the Dow earlier this year after undergoing a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nBullish Analysts\n\nDriven by explosive growth prospects, Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish on NVIDIA and raised the target price on the stock. At least 28 of the 58 brokerage firms have raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $1,200, according to LSEG data.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. Of the 41 recommendations, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.8% and 4.88% of all recommendations.\n\nAttractive Valuations\n\nNVIDIA stock has more than doubled so far this year, following a nearly 240% rise in 2023, courtesy of the fast-growing adoption of its H100 AI chips. However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, given that its earnings are growing faster than the share price. NVIDIA is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 46.90 versus 50.14 for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA stock is expected to surge 258% from the current levels and hit a $10 trillion market valuation by 2030, according to I/O Fund tech analyst Beth Kindig (read: NVIDIA's Explosive Earnings: Should You Buy the Stock or ETFs Now?).\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nStrive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC) – NVIDIA occupies the top position with 30.3% of assets.\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) - NVIDIA is the top firm, accounting for 23.3% share. \r\n\r\nGrizzle Growth ETF (DARP) - NVIDIA occupies the top position with 22.6% of the assets.\r\n\r\nTrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF (LRNZ) - NVIDIA takes the top spot at 16.4% share.\r\n\r\nInvesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ) - NVIDIA occupies the top position with a 14.6% share in the basket.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Top-Ranked Stocks Powering Nasdaq's Rally to the 17,000 Mark",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite Index hit a series of record highs and closed above the 17,000 milestone for the first time ever. Solid corporate earnings, artificial intelligence (AI) boom and rate cut bets have been driving stocks higher. In particular, NVIDIA’s blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism in the stock market along with the global artificial intelligence boom. This drove Nasdaq further up. The tech-heavy index has risen 13.4% so far this year.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the stocks have performed well this year, we have highlighted five of them that more than doubled this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These are Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, Vital Farms Inc. VITL, Powell Industries Inc. POWL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and AppLovin Corporation APP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its AI-enabled GPU chips. The AI chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share.\r\n\r\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth in the tech sector and beyond. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\r\n\r\nHowever, concerns over stubborn inflation once again might halt the rally in the Index. This is because the Fed minutes and upbeat manufacturing data, both of which highlight concerns over stubborn inflation, have again pushed back the timing of rate cuts.\r\n\r\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, it failed to show further progress toward the Fed’s 2% objective in recent months, per its latest minutes. As such, the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought. Meanwhile, U.S. business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth led by an upturn in the service sector. The data indicates that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. The strength in the economy could spark a revival in inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nSuper Micro designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. The stock has skyrocketed 208% so far this year.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro saw a positive earnings estimate revision of $1.34 for the fiscal year ending June 2024 and has an earnings growth rate of 99.1%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and a solid Momentum Score of B.\r\n\r\nVital Farms offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods.

        "title": "Nasdaq Tops 17K: 5 Best-Performing Stocks in ETF YTD",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite Index hit a new record high, topping the 17,000 level for the first time ever. Solid corporate earnings and rate cut bets have been driving stocks higher. In particular, NVIDIA’s blockbuster earnings spread huge optimism into the stock market along with the global artificial intelligence (AI) boom. This led the Nasdaq to move further higher. The tech-heavy index has risen 13.4% so far this year.\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ QQQ, which serves as a proxy to the Nasdaq Index, gained 12% in the year-to-date timeframe. As such, we have highlighted the five best-performing stocks of QQQ this year that led the way higher in the portfolio. These are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Constellation Energy Corporation CEG, Micron Technology MU, Moderna Inc. MRNA and Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA topped both earnings and revenue estimates and offered a bullish revenue outlook for the current quarter, thanks to the solid demand for its AI-enabled GPU chips. The AI chipmaker announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective Jun 7, and increased its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to 10 cents per share (read: NVIDIA's Explosive Earnings: Should You Buy the Stock or ETFs Now?).\r\n\r\nPer the latest survey from Bank of America, expectations of interest rate cuts rather than earnings optimism have made investors the \"most bullish\" since November 2021. About 82% of global fund managers expect the first rate cut by the Fed in the second half, while 78% say a recession is unlikely in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth in the tech sector and beyond. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\r\n\r\nHowever, concerns over stubborn inflation once again might halt the rally in the Index. This is because the Fed minutes and upbeat manufacturing data, both of which highlight concerns over stubborn inflation, have again pushed back the timing of rate cuts.\r\n\r\nWhile inflation has eased over the past year, it failed to show further progress toward the Fed’s 2% objective in recent months, per its latest minutes. As such, the disinflation process would likely take longer than previously thought. Meanwhile, U.S. business activity growth accelerated sharply to its fastest pace in more than two years in May after two months of slower growth led by an upturn in the service sector. The data indicates that the U.S. economy is back on course for another solid GDP gain in the second quarter. The strength in the economy could spark a revival in inflation.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.\n\nStory continues\n\nQQQ in Focus\n\nInvesco QQQ provides exposure to 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. Information technology accounts for 58.9% of the assets, while consumer discretionary makes up 17.9% share.\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $268.2 billion and an average daily volume of around 37 million shares. Invesco QQQ charges investors 20 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: What's in the Cards for Nasdaq ETFs?).\r\n\r\nBelow, we have highlighted the abovementioned five stocks in the ETF with their respective positions in the fund’s basket.\n\nTop-Performing Stocks in QQQ\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Best High Growth Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other fast growth stocks. Recently Baron Funds said the following about NVIDIA Corporation:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the Fund’s largest position. We believe NVIDIA continues to be at the epicenter of one of the biggest technological paradigm shifts of the last 50 years as computing is shifting from sequential to accelerated and as we begin to see the early stages of the use cases of generative AI (GenAI) enter the mainstream. Is GenAI real? Is it going to be material, sustainable, and disruptive? Will NVIDIA (and other GenAI leaders and disruptors) likely benefit from this disruptive change? Our research suggests that the answer to all of these questions is an unequivocal – yes\"\n\nYou can see Baron Funds' entire comments here.\n\nGrowth stocks are those that are either growing their revenue in mid to high double or triple digit percentages or those who trade at significantly higher prices when compared to their earnings. Using a high P/E ratio is the more commonly accepted definition of growth stocks, and sometimes, investors are richly rewarded for their faith.\n\nWhile we'll get to the specifics later, there are several stock indexes and exchange traded funds that track growth stocks. Some of the more popular growth stock indexes and ETFs are Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIGAX) ETF and the S&P 500 Pure Growth stock index. The performance of these ETFs and indexes depends, for most part, on the economic climate. A well known investment principle is that growth stocks perform well when interest rates are low and consumers and businesses are able to comfortably splurge for pricey products and services.\n\nYear to date, the Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares (VIGAX) and the S&P 500 Pure Growth index are up by 15% and 12%, respectively. This allows the S&P stock index to match the benchmark index in performance, while the Vanguard Fund has gained more since the S&P is up by roughly 12% year to date.\n\nOver the past twelve months, a period characterized by high but stable interest rates, easing inflation, robust economic growth, and the AI boom, the S&P 500 has gained 27.7%. The index bottomed in October 2023 and so did our ETF and index. The Vanguard ETF is up by 34.9% over the year, and the S&P Pure Growth index has lagged the broader index through its 24% gains. Compare these all around rosy figures with the 32% that the index lost between January 2022 and June 2022 and the additional 32% bled by the ETF and you'll see how growth stocks are sensitive to high rates and inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, trying to see where interest rates are heading would also serve one well when talking about fast growth stocks. On this front, one 'proxy' that can be used to gauge investor sentiment is the Russel 2000 index. This is a small cap stock index, and if investors become optimistic about lighter rates, then the shares rise since smaller firms are often more at risk from higher rates than corporate titans.\n\nSmall-cap stock indices have been relatively flat year to date by having registered an unimpressive 2% in gains. This is unsurprising as the year has seen Wall Street progressively tone down rate cut expectations. However, from mid April to late May, the small caps have gained 6%, so perhaps the winds are changing for interest rates. However, this hasn't been the case, since two of its strongest performing stocks have posted 100%+ in gains. One of these is a fast growth stock when compared to the broader benchmark multiple.\n\nThis stock is none other than the rather infamous Super Micro. If you're unaware, Super Micro has been caught in the market's artificial intelligence surge too since it is a semiconductor stock. It has a trailing twelve month price to earnings ratio of 49.27 which is high compared to the commonly accepted definition of a growth stock. However, Super Micro's P/E ratio is lower than the semiconductor sector average of 82.75. The market trailing P/E for this data set is 52.28, and it represents 94 sectors. Within these sectors, 26 have a higher trailing P/E ratio than the market ratio, and among these, nearly half have a higher trailing P/E ratio than the semiconductor industry. However, the higher value for semiconductors is a clear example of how artificial intelligence has transformed the market.\n\nYet, even before AI was a part of daily media coverage, semiconductor stocks had already given us a historic growth story. This comes in the form of the chip designer AMD. AMD's shares are up by a whopping 506% over the past five years, while the S&P 500 has gained 92% during the time period. Despite this stunning growth, the AI onset has led AMD to have a trailing P/E ratio of a whopping 232.51 (forward P/E is 45.66, which is precisely in tune with the sector's 45.77). Between 2010 and 2025, AMD's profitability trend started in 2018, and saw the P/E ratio jump to 515 in early 2023 when earnings took a hit from a glut in the semiconductor industry. AMD's eight cents of EPS in the third quarter of 2023 also meant that as the market bumped its valuation due to AI, the P/E ratio soared 1,285 - making it a classic example of a fast growth stock.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best fast growth stocks, we first narrowed down the 20 stocks that had the highest trailing P/E ratios and five year and quarter over quarter revenue growth greater than 30%. These were ranked through the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 according to Insider Monkey's data of hedge fund holdings. Moreover, for each of these stocks, we looked at how many hedge funds from our database held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 186\n\nTTM P/E Ratio: 62.12\n\nAI and semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops our list of the best fast growth stocks, which is unsurprising if we're honest. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have soared by triple digit percentages over the past year, and this has also been the case for its revenue and profit. The latest set of results for the first quarter saw NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat analyst revenue estimates of $24.6 billion by posting $26 billion. Adjusted EPS of $6.12 beat analyst estimates of $5.59.\n\nBy Q1 2024 end, 186 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners held the largest stake which was worth $12 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks first on our list of the best high growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Click to see the 10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now. NVDA is now a $2.8 trillion company and trades at a forward PE of 41. Assuming that its extremely high growth rate continues for a few more years, this is a very cheap stock. This is a big assumption that hedge funds and other investors are betting on right now. The market is assuming that NVDA will earn nearly $70 billion over the next 12 months, $100 billion in 2 years, $150 billion in 3 years, and then grow those profits at high single digits for the foreseeable future (the same rate S&P 500 companies grow their earnings annually). I think the probability of this happening is less than 50% as NVDA needs to defend its moat for a couple of decades which is a very long time in the tech industry. Intel couldn’t defend its moat for two decades and now trades at less than NVDA’s 2026 expected earnings. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Protect Against the Collapse of the American Family",
        "content": "We’re in the middle of a Baby Bust. Births have been trending sharply lower since 2007. The number of babies born in America is now at its lowest level since 1979.\n\nAccording to the research platform Microtrends, the current birth rate for the U.S. is 1.787 live births per woman. That’s less than the 2.1 births per woman a nation needs to simply replace itself from one generation to the next (excluding immigration).\n\nIn 1979, the birth rate was 1.81 live births per woman. That doesn’t seem very much bigger than today until you put it in perspective: Our population today – at 333.3 million – is 48% bigger than it was – at 225.1 million – in 1979.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means the number of babies born now is far lower than 1979 levels. In short, our birth rate has plummeted, as is clearly visible in the chart below.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nAnd what effect is it having?\n\nLet’s address one question at a time.\n\nWhy Are Americans Today Having so Few Children?\n\nThe simple answer is that they’re broke and can’t afford them.\n\nMost would-be parents are not financially prepared enough to start families when they kick off their professional lives buried in tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in student-loan debt.\n\nEven if they were ready for that white picket fence in the suburbs, they’d have a hard time finding an affordable house. According to Redfin, home affordability is the worst it’s been in nearly 40 years… and that assumes two working parents. Having a new mom take time off to be with her baby is pure fantasy for most young couples.\n\nTo add insult to injury, white-collar hiring across much of the U.S. – in industries such as finance, technology, media, law, and accounting – has stalled. So starting your career and growing in it is as hard as it’s ever been.\n\nThis is borne out by an increasing number of reports in mainstream media decrying the shortage of college-level jobs available for new graduates. And white-collar jobs in the entertainment and technology sectors are increasingly hard to come by as some of the biggest employers – such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) subsidiary Optum – continue layoffs.\n\nThis is increasingly leading to a troubling trend of underemployment amongst college graduates. According to New York Times’ columnist Peter Coy, 52% of college grads are underemployed a year after graduation, working in jobs that don’t require the degrees they earned. A decade after graduation, 45% of graduates are underemployed.\n\nStory continues\n\nNever mind that these young adults are trying to start a career and family saddled with student loan debt. The average federal student loan debt in 2023 was $37,088. The total average (including private loan debt) is $39,981.\n\nAll of this is to say that young adults are increasingly delaying starting a family and having children because they simply cannot afford to do so. They can barely afford to move out of their parents’ house, let alone feed and raise little humans that not only cost a fortune to feed and educate, but also require daycare – itself an exorbitant expense – for both parents to work.\n\nPointing the Finger\n\nWe can thank the Federal Reserve and governmental financial incompetence for this mess.\n\nWhen the Fed injected $5 trillion into the monetary system during the pandemic, it inflated the prices of virtually all assets, including homes. The resulting inflation forced the central bank to then aggressively raise interest rates, which made affordability even worse.\n\nAnd a deficit rising by $1 trillion every 100 days is exacerbating the inflation problem.\n\nI don’t see any of this getting better any time soon.\n\nThe forces pushing Americans into having smaller families or not having families at all don’t turn on a dime. If anything, they’ll likely get worse before they get better.\n\nAll we can do is protect ourselves from the potential fallout.\n\nThis requires smart – and agile – investing.\n\nHave inflation hedges in your investment portfolio.\n\nInvest in companies with good track records in essential industries. And add short-term investing – even trading – to your wealth-creation arsenal.\n\nHere are three stocks to buy now to achieve all three goals… and ultimately protect you against the ravages a declining population (a topic for another day) will have on the U.S. economy.\n\nProtection Stock No. 1: National Retail Properties (NNN) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nTens of millions of Americans depend on Social Security to meet their basic income needs in retirement. But a pay-as-you-go system like this isn’t fundamentally different from a Ponzi scheme. It works so long as there are a lot of young workers paying into the system and relatively few retirees drawing benefits.\n\nThat’s not the situation today… and the lower the birth rate goes or the longer it stays depressed, the worse the math gets.\n\nNo politician wants to touch this – they call Social Security the “third rail of American politics” for a reason – but math is math.\n\nIf you still have a few years until you draw Social Security, you should just assume that substantially all of it will be taxed and that your benefits will likely shrink, at least relative to inflation.\n\nThis means you need income. One nice source of reliable and growing income is in high-traffic, mission-critical real estate.\n\nTake a look at National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN). This real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a diverse portfolio of convenience stores, car washes, and other properties that tend to be both recession proof and future proof.\n\nThe stock sports a dividend yield of 5.4%, in line with T-bills.\n\nBut unlike bond interest – which is fixed – NNN’s dividend has historically risen over time. It’s raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years and counting.\n\nA stock like this can help to supplement shortfalls in your Social Security check.\n\nProtection Stock No. 2: SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM) A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDemographic pressures are going to put enormous strain on the dollar in the decades ahead. I can’t tell you exactly how this plays out, but I expect it to look something like this…\n\nThe national debt is already closing in on $35 trillion. We’re adding an extra trillion every 100 days. That’s not sustainable. At some point, our lenders – the bond market – will balk, requiring a much higher interest rate to compensate for the higher risk of a borrower this deeply in debt.\n\nAt that point, selling bonds becomes prohibitively expensive… so the Federal Reserve steps in and effectively directly finances the government.\n\nIf you don’t have at least a couple dollar hedges in your portfolio, you’re risking your financial future.\n\nOne of the best and most reliable dollar hedges is gold. You could buy coins and keep them somewhere safe, of course. But for your IRA or other financial accounts, it’s generally going to be easier to buy an ETF like the SPDR Gold MiniShares (NYSEARCA:GLDM).\n\nProtection Stock No. 3: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnd finally, throughout war, peace, inflation, deflation, and every manner of financial calamity, America’s biggest and best-run blue-chip companies have a way of surviving and thriving. This is why, at The Freeport Society, we call them the “rich man’s super currency.”\n\nAs a long-term wealth protector and grower, you need quality growth companies. One such company is the AI chip darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThis is a company that has redefined itself twice in the past decade alone, evolving from a maker of video game graphics chips to a maker of Bitcoin mining chips. Now it’s becoming the leading maker of the chips needed to power the AI boom.\n\nThe stock looks a bit rich at today’s prices, so you might want to wait for a pullback before jumping in. But regardless, always make sure that your portfolio has a core of quality growth stocks.\n\nWith these three stocks, and others along the same lines, you can prepare yourself from the fall out of the collapsing American family.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Sizemore held a LONG position in NNN and BTC-USD.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Buy on Monster Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox, click here.\n\nIn February, AI superstar Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced fourth-quarter earnings that blew expectations out of the water. Shares rose 16% in a single day, adding $34 billion to shareholder pockets.\n\nThe fascinating thing, however, was what happened afterward. Because over the following month, shares of Nvidia rose another 20%. Even if investors completely missed out Nvidia’s monster Q4 earnings, they could have made even more money from buying after the fact.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giant isn’t alone in seeing this market momentum effect. Commodities… international stocks… real estate… virtually all well-traded assets seem to retain some “memory” of their past movements. Rising prices tend to keep going up, while falling ones keep going down.\n\nMany academics have attempted to answer why. They studied the concepts of “inertia” and “harmonics” as early as the 1930s. And later academic works in 1980s focused on data “heterogeneity,” a term for how information flows across markets. There is still no single answer that everyone agrees on.\n\nStill, we’ve found that momentum works. Earnings beats tend to improve Wall Street’s outlook on a company, which historically drives share prices higher. Successful companies also find it easier to raise capital and generate internal cash flows, which can fund even greater future successes. Nvidia itself expected to pour $9.2 billion into research and development (R&D) this year thanks to its windfall. It will outspend all but two other chip developers. It’s why Louis Navellier considers earnings beats so crucial in his Portfolio Grader system, and why it features so heavily in my own MarketMaster AI trading system.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings are now creating a whole new market of “haves” and “have-nots” in this momentum-heavy market.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia are pulling ahead while consumer-facing firms are starting to fall behind. Earnings at firms like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) were so bad that writers at CNBC called this quarter the “long-predicted consumer pullback.”\n\nThat’s why the writers at our free news and analysis site – InvestorPlace.com – are focusing on successful companies that are announcing blowout earnings. Pandemic-era savings are beginning to deplete for both consumers and enterprises, and our analysts are closely watching which firms are succeeding.\n\n5 Stocks to Buy on Monster Q1 Earnings: Digital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), a data center real estate investment trust, announced stunning first-quarter results on May 2. Earnings per share of 82 cents blew expectations out of the water, while new bookings also came in strong. Wall Street was only expecting 24 cents EPS, so the world’s largest owner of data centers beat forecasts by almost 250%.\n\nThese results were driven by 1) an insatiable demand for AI-related data centers and 2) a severe market shortage of them. DLR raised renewal prices by an average of 12% this quarter and booked a record $252 million in additional annualized revenue.\n\nAt InvestorPlace.com, Rich Duprey even sees Digital Realty Trust as a stock to buy for a potential downturn.\n\nBusiness continues to move its data to the cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly critical component for ensuring the health and integrity of the information. The need for data centers won’t abate during a market crash. It would be just as important that data is accessible and viable — if not more so, particularly considering the caliber of Digital Realty’s clients.\n\nThat’s because DLR will profit in both good times and bad. Companies are only creating more data, and the costs of analyzing this information are only growing. Cloud computing in the form of data centers provides a compelling solution.\n\nEven better, shares of Digital Realty Trust have not yet moved on earnings news. Shares are only up 3% since May 2, providing investors with an opening to buy the stock at a reasonable 20 times cash flow.\n\n2. Western Digital (WDC) photo of glass Western Digital (WDC) company building with black letter logo on front face\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.co\n\nMemory-chip maker Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) released an equally impressive earnings report on April 25. Revenues of $3.45 billion beat expectations by 3%, while earnings per share of 63 cents beat by 204%. After a terrible 2023, the cyclical memory industry is finally entering a period of growth again. Wall Street analysts have now raised their WDC target price to $86.60, up from $52 at the start of 2024.\n\nDuprey also notes this week at InvestorPlace.com that Western Digital has another potential catalyst to drive shares higher. The firm plans to split itself into two companies, and we know that spinoffs are historically strong events for returns.\n\nWestern Digital and Kioxia reportedly increased first-quarter output to 1.22 million units, according to industry site Omdia. That’s a 20% increase over the 1.02 million units produced in the fourth quarter. That would be a fortuitous turnaround for the spinoff.\n\nShares of Western Digital have been rising ever since the separation was announced last year and the new company could make for an interesting play on the memory market.\n\nAnalysts have now raised their 2024 earnings estimates by 56% over the past 30 days. And given that Western Digital’s stock hasn’t really moved yet, this could present a compelling moment to jump in on a hidden gem before markets catch on.\n\n3. Robinhood (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nStock trading platform Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is a tough company for long-term investors to buy. The firm scores an F grade in my MarketMaster AI system for its high short interest and lumpy profitability. Louis’s Portfolio Grader awards Robinhood’s fundamentals a C for similar reasons.\n\nHowever, the numbers don’t lie: Robinhood could see a near-term boost in share prices thanks to blowout first-quarter earnings.\n\nOn May 9, the Silicon Valley-based firm announced quarterly revenues of $618 million and EPS of 18 cents, beating estimates by 13% and 226%, respectively. Rising cryptocurrency prices and renewed retail trading interest have put the company back on a path of growth. InvestorPlace.com’s Larry Ramer notes that investment bank Mizuho has now raised its target price to $23, a 29% implied upside.\n\nFellow InvestorPlace.com writer Marc Guberti now urges investors to look beyond Robinhood’s reputation as a one-trick pony.\n\nThe company’s foray into innovative financial products and services can create more opportunities. Investors are monitoring the company’s unlimited 3% cashback credit card that is available for Robinhood Gold members. Also, [the] fintech firm has an impressive 3% match for IRA contributions.\n\nVery few financial institutions and fintech companies have these types of offers. Most companies don’t match any of your IRA contributions. Robinhood can gain more ground as it releases innovative products and its trading platform continues to perform well. While the fintech company has fallen by 49% since its IPO, the stock is up by [65]% YTD. Therefore, investors are starting to realize Robinhood’s potential, and a recent switch to profitability has helped matters.\n\nPut another way, Robinhood’s Q1 results might be a sign of even greater improvements to come. The company now earns over $250 million each quarter from interest-based revenues (the interest earned on investor cash deposits). And the rising popularity of options could put Robinhood’s transaction revenues on more stable footing.\n\n4. SoFi (SOFI) An advertisement for SoFi, a fintech personal finance startup, in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline banking firm SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) joins the list of strong earners this quarter. Revenues came in 4.4% better than expected, its largest positive surprise since 2022. Earnings were also impressive, with total profits beating forecasts by a solid 20%.\n\nPerhaps the most notable feat, however, was that these figures were achieved without loan origination growth and only a 5.4% increase in loan balances. In other words, SoFi is purposely tapping on the brakes to balance its risks… and is still beating Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nWill Ashworth sees SoFi’s conservative approach as a reason to buy shares.\n\n“SoFi continues to add customers and deposits as its banking business grows,” he writes at InvestorPlace.com. “Restrained growth in a higher interest rate environment is a good thing.”\n\nHe views the firm as the ultimate long-term winner.\n\nHe’s not alone. InvestorPlace’s David Moadel sees shares topping $10 in the medium term, thanks to rising forecasts and strong underlying growth.\n\nEssentially, SoFi’s management is keenly aware that banks that grow too quickly tend to face problems with bad loans. FICO credit scores only tell part of a borrower’s story, and regional lenders like First Republic and Signature Bank folded in 2023 precisely because they grew too quickly in markets they didn’t understand.\n\nSoFi is taking a different tack – allowing its services business (i.e., non-lending) to grow fast, while keeping loan growth to manageable levels. First-quarter results showed this strategy in full light, and it’s only a matter of time before markets realize there’s more to SoFi’s story.\n\n5. Bumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Josh Enomoto writes at InvestorPlace.com about Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL). The dating app, he writes, is a potential breakout stock.\n\nIn my opinion, Bumble needs a simple tweak. It needs to focus more on the business rather than attempting to engineer gender equity in relationships. That means in traditionally oriented couplings, the company must allow male users to reach out to female users. Currently, women must make the first move, which hurts participation and engagement…\n\nA ship can always be righted if the damage is caught in time.\n\nSince that writeup, lo and behold, management says it is revamping Bumble’s core business. Men can now make the first move if allowed, and the dating firm is also finding new ways to monetize through Premium+ subscriptions. As CEO Lidiane Jones noted in her Q1 earnings call:\n\nWe have expanded upon our signature make the first move by introducing choice in how connections made. Women can choose to make the first move as always. And now, they can choose to have a question set that their matches can respond to, creating a new way to engage with connection while retaining control…\n\nWe’re [also] expanding monetization, once our updated Premium+ subscription is here. We continue to have conviction that our subscription tiers are designed to bring value to our customers by offering them the fastest path to finding their matches.\n\nThe company also announced strong first-quarter earnings. Revenues of $268 million beat expectations by 1%, while EPS of 19 cents came in 181% ahead. Not only is management revamping its core user experience; these efforts are already having an effect.\n\nThese improvements will go a long way to win back skeptics. Analysts now expect Bumble to earn 86 cents per share this year in profits, a major upward revision since January. And growth is expected to accelerate through 2025 as these efforts play out. If history is any guide, Bumble’s initial 7% post-earnings pop should be followed by even greater gains to come as markets begin to realize that Bumble’s growth story is far from over.\n\nMarketMaster AI is an artificial-intelligence-powered stock picking system that uses an ensemble of neural networks to grade stocks based on their expected 6-month returns.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Coattails: 3 Stocks to Ride the AI Chipmaker’s Earnings Success",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just released what was arguably its best earnings report ever. Revenues and profitability both reached historical highs, and the company bested Wall Street’s expectations. That report showed that revenues grew by 18% in Q1, reaching $26 billion. This has lead investors to start eyeing other AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe blowout report from Nvidia should serve to pull the broader AI sector higher still. Nvidia dominates the sector but there is a massive opportunity for other firms. Let’s look at three of the more AI stocks to buy following Nvidia’s latest positive news.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the primary challenger to Nvidia in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. It’s a battle in which AMD has long been trailing. Honestly, that’s not likely to change soon. It’s clear that demand for Nvidia’s best chips is much greater than that for AMD best.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd that’s not a bad thing. AMD actually has a very comfortable position at the moment. it has established its chips as the lower priced alternative to those from Nvidia. The largest and most important chip buyers including companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have made no secret about it. They are willing to invest heavily in AMD chips despite their slightly lower performance specifications.\n\nIn other words, AMD is in the enviable position of receiving the positive benefits of enterprise frustration with Nvidia’s pricing strategies. It’s a pretty good place to be while simultaneously making efforts to best Nvidia’s AI chips.\n\nBeyond that, Nvidia doesn’t have enough supply to meet demand, offering AMD another opportunity to prove its chips.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock has been noted as a beneficiary of Nvidia’s bounce across headlines covering the financial world.\n\nThe memory chip provider recently forged a relationship with Nvidia that should set it up for a period of strong success. Micron Technology is one of the leading providers of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. Those are integral to artificial intelligence. It is a segment dominated by Korean firms SK Hynix and Samsung.\n\nFortunately for Micron Technology, it has forged a strong relationship with Nvidia due to its superior memory process. That has allowed the company to make significant headway as a competitor to the two Korean firms. Micron Technology’s opportunity looks to be strengthening following news that Samsung’s HBM chips are failing Nvidia’s tests.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Samsung refutes the claims, and Nvidia declined to comment, Sources say that Samsung has been trying to pass Nvidia’s tests since last year. Those same sources say that the most recent failure occurred in April and is just now coming to light.\n\nMicron Technology is in prime position as a result.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is bound to be both interesting and volatile in the wake of Nvidia’s blowout earnings report.\n\nBased on price movement, it’s clear that some traders were only interested in securing gains following the earnings print. Prices jumped up on the news and then receded as profit takers sold their positions.\n\nInvestors shouldn’t take that to mean that the opportunity in Super Micro Computer is over. Remember, Super Micro Computer sells servers heavily featuring Nvidia’s GPUs. The company’s shares have soared as companies of all sizes  have moved to deploy artificial intelligence at scale.\n\nThe latest news again proves that Nvidia continues to see extraordinarily high demand. That should translate to increased demand for the server packages that Super Micro Computer produces.\n\nDon’t be surprised that investors took profits off the table on the strong news. It’s understandable. However, also be aware that the data center opportunity is extraordinarily strong, especially given that it accounted for $22.6 billion of Nvidia’s $26 billion in sales during the first quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Blue-Chip Bargains: Weak Q1 Results Spell Opportunity in These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "It’s not uncommon to see blue-chip stocks trading at a valuation premium. The reasons include low-beta, dividends, share repurchase and stable cash flows. However, the markets tend to be sensitive to news or quarterly numbers. Therefore, temporary weakness in quality blue-chip stocks presents a good opportunity to buy quality names. This column focuses on blue-chip stocks to buy that trade at attractive levels after weak Q1 results.\n\nAs a long-term investor, focus on the vision for growth and value creation than numbers for every quarter. Even the best of companies can go through rough times. The secret to market success is adding quality stocks on the decline instead of panic selling. The stocks discussed represent companies with good fundamentals but near-term weaknesses. These ideas can deliver healthy returns once the macroeconomic or industry-specific headwinds are navigated.\n\nLet’s discuss the reasons for being bullish when the markets are bearish.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has declined by 27% year-to-date. The sharp correction has been on the back of weak quarterly numbers. Competition and macroeconomic headwinds have impacted Tesla’s growth and profitability.\n\nThe correction in TSLA stock is a good opportunity for accumulation. The company is an innovator and is likely to make a strong comeback. With potential rate cuts in the coming quarters, Tesla will benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nRecently, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, opined that Tesla is “far ahead in self-driving cars.” That’s one possible area of massive value creation with robotaxis that will “make money for their owners and a driverless transportation network.”\n\nFurther, as competition intensifies, Tesla might look at its impending promise of low-cost cars. This will likely be a game-changer in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and India. With high financial flexibility, Tesla has the headroom to invest in new manufacturing facilities in countries like Indonesia and India.\n\nTarget (TGT) A Target (TGT) store during dusk\n\nSource: Target\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) stock had touched highs of $182 in April. However, there has been a meaningful correction from those levels, with TGT stock currently trading at $145. The correction has been largely on the back of mixed Q1 2024 numbers. I don’t see a further downside with TGT stock trading at a forward P/E of 15.5.\n\nAn important point is that consumption spending is a key growth driver for the U.S. economy. With GDP growth decelerating, multiple rate cuts will likely be pursued in the next 12 to 18 months. Target will likely benefit as lower money costs translate into higher consumption spending. From a macroeconomic perspective, this is a crucial reason for being bullish on TGT stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second point to note is that Target has reaffirmed its guidance for the full year for comparable store sales growth of 0% to 2%. Further, the GAAP and adjusted EPS are expected at $8.6 and $9.6, respectively. The coming quarters are, therefore, likely to be good, and I expect a strong reversal rally toward the end of the year.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) is another company that has posed mixed results for Q1 2024. With macroeconomic headwinds being a key factor, UPS stock has declined by around 12% for year-to-date. The 4.7% dividend yield stock trades at a forward P/E of 17 and looks attractive. The downside is, therefore, a good opportunity to accumulate this blue-chip stock.\n\nFor Q1 2024, UPS reported a decline of 5.3% in consolidated revenue on a year-on-year basis to $21.7 billion. At the same time, the company’s operating margin declined by 310 basis points to 8%. While the quarter numbers disappointed investors, there are two positives to note.\n\nFirst, UPS has reaffirmed revenue guidance from $92 to $94.5 billion. Further, driven by operating efficiencies, UPS expects an operating margin of 10% to 10.6%.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that UPS reported a free cash flow of $2.3 billion.

        "content": "In today’s market, anyone can look smart saying that stocks like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Meta (NASDAQ:META) are good investments. However, the best investments are often found by investors identifying overlooked stocks that the rest of the market has yet to catch up on. If you can enter these stocks at the right time, the returns have the potential to be life-changing over a long enough period. Imagine entering NVIDIA before it was a billion-dollar company!\n\nSo how can we identify these overlooked stocks ready to take the next step? Well, the best way is proper due diligence and research for fundamental catalysts like an industry-changing product, or stellar year-over-year financial growth. In this article, we’ll highlight three such overlooked stocks that are still flying under the radar for most investors.\n\nDespegar.com (DESP)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf you are from the States, there’s no need to be embarrassed if you have never heard of this company. Despegar.com (NYSE:DESP) is a leading Latin American online travel technology brand. As of now, six analysts have given DESP a projected one-year average price target of $14.42 and a high-end target of $19.00.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespegar.com offers a unique opportunity to invest in a regional travel industry flattened by the pandemic. It offers the largest selection of regional airlines and accommodations through an award-winning mobile or desktop app. Through its acquisition of Koin, Despegar has since entered the buy-now-pay-later market and is expected to continue growing its addressable market into entirely new customers. \r\n\r\nIn the most recent quarter, Despegar saw strong profitability and beat consensus earnings estimates by 120%. However, while DESP is trading a minimal price multiple at just 1.6x sales, some investors might worry about larger fish entering the waters. While other incredible Latin American stocks like MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) are already eyeing DESP for a potential acquisition, we see DESP’s current rise into the limelight as a great opportunity for investors to diversify into a relatively cheap local industry leader.\n\nPinDuoDuo (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinDuoDuo (NASDAQ:PDD) is usually not the first Chinese tech stock investors think of. It has often been overshadowed by stocks like AliBaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY). Wall Street analysts are well aware of the potential for PDD as they have an average price target of $201.09 with a street-high price target of $276.72. The high-end price target indicates more than 70% upside from its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis company exploded during the pandemic with its agricultural eCommerce platform that connected farmers directly with consumers in China. Now, PinDuoDuo has launched its discount marketplace Temu in more than 50 markets worldwide. The result? PinDuoDuo reported a 130% year-over-year rise in revenue and 245% year-over-year growth in net income during the first quarter of 2024. Earnings-per-share jumped by 99% from the same quarter in 2023.\n\nPinDuoDuo has always traded with a China discount. Shares are trading at just 13x forward earnings and 5.5x sales. On a price multiple basis, the stock is cheaper now at a $218 billion market cap than when it had a $100 billion market cap. At this rate, don’t be surprised if five or ten years from now, PinDuoDuo is the best-performing Chinese ADR stock on the market!\n\nOnOn Holdings (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe complete our list of three overlooked stocks with our third international company: OnOn Holdings (NASDAQ:ONON). In May, 16 of 21 analysts rated the stock a Buy or Strong Buy. They also have an average one-year price target of $39.66, with the highest target being $54.51.\n\nOnOn has taken the running apparel and footwear world by storm. You might not recognize the brand by name, which goes by On Cloud, but you have likely seen the unique-looking shoe styles. Earnings in the most recent quarter beat estimates by 128% and On saw a 105% year-over-year growth in quarterly net income. One of the biggest growth drivers behind this performance has been ONON’s commitment to growing its number of high-profile investors and athletes including Roger Federer as a core marketing strategy.\n\nThe company is in high-growth mode right now and trades at a fairly high multiple. Shares trade at 42.7x forward earnings and 12.6x sales. With ONON expected to ramp up marketing again this summer and into the next Olympic games, investors should look out for key pullbacks for the chance to buy into this amazing growth trajectory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock: 4 Reasons to Buy, 4 Reasons to Sell",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock jumped 9% to a new all-time high on May 23, after the company posted its latest earnings report. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 28, the chipmaker's revenue surged 262% year over year to $26.0 billion and exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.5 billion. Its adjusted earnings surged 461% to $6.12 per share and also cleared the consensus forecast by $0.54.\n\nThose growth rates were explosive, but does Nvidia's stock still have room to run after rallying about 2,720% over the past five years? Let's review the four reasons to buy Nvidia's stock -- as well as the four reasons to sell it -- to decide. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe key numbers\n\nBack in fiscal 2023, which ended in January of that year, Nvidia's revenue flatlined as its adjusted EPS fell 25%. Its sales of gaming GPUs cooled off as PC shipments declined in a post-pandemic market, and the macro headwinds curbed its sales of data center chips. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted EPS surged 126% and 288%, respectively.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Revenue growth (YOY) (13%) 101% 206% 265% 262% Adjusted gross margin 66.8% 71.2% 75% 76.7% 78.9% Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) (20%) 429% 593% 486% 461%\n\nData source: Nvidia.\n\nThat abrupt acceleration was driven by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia's data center GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks, and the market's demand for those chips quickly outstripped its available supply. Nvidia generated 87% of its revenue from its data center chips in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia also announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will take effect on June 7. The split won't alter Nvidia's valuations, but it might attract some interest from smaller retail investors while boosting the stock's liquidity through more options trading.\n\nThe four reasons to buy Nvidia\n\nThe bulls still love Nvidia for four reasons. First, they believe it will continue to dominate the AI market with its data center GPUs. The global AI market could still expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to Markets and Markets, and Nvidia could be the simplest way to profit from that secular boom.\n\nSecond, its first mover's advantage in the AI space gives it tremendous pricing power. Its top-tier H100 GPUs cost more than $40,000, and it can keep raising those prices to boost its gross margin. Third, Nvidia's gaming business, 10% of its first-quarter revenue, is gradually recovering as the PC market stabilizes.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued relative to its growth potential. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 43% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 49%.\n\nBased on those estimates, Nvidia's stock trades at just 41 times forward earnings. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), which is growing at a much slower rate and has less exposure to the AI market, trades at 46 times forward earnings.\n\nThe four reasons to sell Nvidia\n\nMeanwhile, the bears are skeptical about Nvidia for four reasons. First, they believe Nvidia will lose its first mover's advantage in the data center GPU market as more competitors carve up the market. AMD's new Instinct data center GPUs already cost less than Nvidia's top-tier GPUs, and tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms have all been developing their own in-house AI chips to reduce their long-term dependence on Nvidia.\n\nSecond, U.S. regulators recently barred Nvidia from shipping its top-tier AI GPUs to China. That pressure could drive Chinese chipmakers to accelerate their development of comparable AI accelerators. If those efforts are successful, Chinese companies could eventually flood the global market with cheaper AI chips and crush Nvidia's gross margins.\n\nThird, Nvidia's insiders sold about twice as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months. That cooling insider sentiment suggests that Nvidia could be running out of room to run as the market hovers near its all-time highs. Last but not least, the recent buying frenzy in AI chips could eventually lead to a supply glut if the market finally cools off.\n\nThe strengths still outweigh the weaknesses\n\nNvidia faces some long-term challenges, but I believe its strengths still clearly outweigh its weaknesses. Its business is still firing on all cylinders, its margin is expanding, and its stock still looks reasonably valued. Therefore, it's not too late to accumulate more shares of Nvidia if you believe the AI market will continue flourishing over the next few decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's \"Blowout\" Quarter Contained a Subtle Warning That Most Investors Likely Missed",
        "content": "Despite no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends over the last three decades, nothing has come close to capturing the buzz that was created on Wall Street when the internet transformed corporate America in the mid-1990s. That is, until now.\n\nFor more than a year, professional and retail investors have been captivated by the game-changing potential of artificial intelligence (AI). AI involves using software and systems in place of humans, and allowing these systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention. Ideally, AI can become more proficient at repetitive tasks, and possibly even learn new skills over time, which would give the technology utility in pretty much every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAs is to be expected, estimates of what AI can bring to the table are all over the place. The standout prognostication comes from the analysts at PwC who believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nAlthough dozens of companies are benefiting from the artificial intelligence revolution, none has more directly seen its share price and operating performance ascend to the heavens quite like semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia, once again, blew past even the loftiest expectations\n\nOne week ago, Nvidia lifted the hood on its fiscal first-quarter operating results (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January) and did what it's been doing with consistency for more than a year -- it blew past any and all expectations from Wall Street institutions and analysts.\n\nNet sales for the company surged a cool 262% to $26 billion from the prior-year period, with its Data Center operations leading the charge. Data Center sales catapulted by 427% on a year-over-year basis to $22.6 billion, with the company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) leading the charge.\n\nIn particular, Nvidia's H100 GPUs are the undeniable top choice by the world's leading businesses for their AI-accelerated data centers. The H100 is being used to train large language models (LLMs) and power generative AI solutions on cloud infrastructure service platforms. Nvidia controls as much as 90% of the AI-accelerated GPU market.\n\nWith demand handily outpacing supply, Nvidia is enjoying exceptionally strong pricing power for its chips. Whereas the company's cost of revenue (across all segments) rose by 122% from the prior-year period, net sales increased by more than twice this rate (the noted 262%) in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nNvidia's top line is also going to benefit from supply chain kinks beginning to work themselves out. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has been meaningfully increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which should allow Nvidia to meet more of its customers' orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe icing on the cake is that the company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and increased its token quarterly dividend by 150%.\n\nIn the 24 hours following Nvidia's earnings release, more than a half-dozen investing sites and Wall Street organizations referred to the company's results as a \"blowout\" in the headlines. But what seemingly every investor appears to have missed is the subtle warning Nvidia provided with its fiscal second-quarter guidance during its conference call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's guidance contains a red flag that shouldn't be ignored\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia expects sales of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%, which easily sailed past the consensus for analysts of about $26.66 billion. While noting demand is overwhelming supply, Nvidia also forecast gross margin of 75.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.\n\nSuperficially, this guidance looks great. After delivering a 64.6% gross margin in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, Nvidia's forecast for a 75.5% gross profit margin in the current quarter appears to show just how quickly this nearly $2.6 trillion company has scaled. But there's a very casual warning here that optimists may be blindly overlooking.\n\nIn the quarter ended on April 28, Nvidia's gross margin came in at 78.35% ($20.406 billion in gross profit divided into $26.044 billion in revenue X 100). In the second quarter, the company's gross margin is set to retrace by 235 to 335 basis points, based on Nvidia's guidance. This might not sound like much, given that its gross margin has expanded by roughly 13.8 percentage points in a year, but it very likely marks the arrival of two awaited headwinds for the company. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFirst of all, Nvidia's external competition is tangibly manifesting. After effectively having the high-compute GPU market to itself, Nvidia will be contending with the launch of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi3 AI-accelerator during the third quarter, and the ongoing rollout of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) MI300X GPU. Both companies have their sights squarely set on rivaling Nvidia's H100 GPUs and winning over enterprises wanting to train LLMs and operating generative AI solutions.\n\nEven if Nvidia's AI-GPUs remain superior to AMD's and Intel's AI-accelerator chips in speed and compute capability, the mere fact that this data center hardware is hitting the market will reduce the scarcity of AI-GPU chips. This scarcity has been the fuel propelling the price of Nvidia's GPUs into the stratosphere. A sequential 235-basis-point to 335-basis-point decline in gross margin might be a signal that weaker pricing power is on the horizon.\n\nThe other issue for Nvidia that shouldn't be ignored is that its top customers are all developing their own AI-GPUs.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet account for about 40% of Nvidia's net sales. Meta Platforms even upped its capital expenditures forecast for 2024, likely to bolster its investments in Nvidia's AI-GPUs. But with all four actively building and deploying in-house AI-accelerators for their data centers, their reliance on Nvidia's hardware is almost certain to diminish in the quarters and years to come. This might be somewhat reflected in Nvidia's forecast sequential decline in gross margin.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also note that every next-big-thing innovation or trend for three decades has endured a bubble-bursting event. While Nvidia looks untouchable at the moment, history is undefeated when it comes to the early stage ramp of buzzy innovations and technologies.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter gross margin guidance may well signal that Nvidia's stock has peaked.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Including debt, the deal values IDS at £5.28bn.\n\nIDS said if the deal goes through Royal Mail would continue its universal service obligation to one-price-goes-anywhere first-class post six days a week, and keep the company’s branding and UK headquarters.\n\nRead more: The tax pledges to watch for in the UK election\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE - European stock markets head lower as Royal Mail agrees £3.5bn takeover\n\nIt also said it would protect existing employment rights of all IDS staff, and that there is “no intention to make any material changes to overall headcount or reductions in the number of frontline workers” beyond existing plans.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nHeavyweight chip maker Nvidia surged by almost 7% to a new high this last session and is the number one trending ticker in pre-market trading as the AI darling eyes Apple’s (AAPL) spot as the world's second most valuable company by market cap, behind Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNvidia shares soared to a record high on Tuesday, putting it close to overtaking Apple with Nvidia now valued at $2.8tn, just shy of Apple's $2.9tn. Shares finished the day above $1,140.\n\nThe milestone moment comes after Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI said Sunday that it raised $6bn in a Series B funding round, sending Nvidia stock up as much as 8% the following trading day.\n\n\"The market has been struggling to keep up with the company's ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesn't feel like bubble territory,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThe stock has now jumped by a third since the start of May, and by 137% over the year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nBHP (BHP.L) has called for further extension to a bid deadline to allow for more talks over a £39bn takeover of rival Anglo American.\n\nUnder UK takeover rules, the Sydney-based company faces a deadline of 5pm UK time on Wednesday to make an offer for Anglo or walk away for 6 months.\n\n\"BHP believes a further extension of the deadline is required to allow for further engagement on its proposal,” it said.\n\nThe mining company said that it was ready to offer a break fee to Anglo American if the deal was blocked due to anti-trust reasons or if it failed to gain regulatory approval.\n\nRead more: What's next for state pension? Sunak unveils 'Triple Lock Plus'\n\n“BHP is confident that the measures it has proposed to the board of Anglo American provide a viable pathway to resolve the matters raised by Anglo American and would support South African regulatory approvals,” it added.\n\nAnglo previously claimed the offers were too risky and complex. The latest bid valued it at £38.6bn. It came after BHP had put forward two prior bids, valuing Anglo at £31.1bn and £34bn respectively.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL)\n\nShares in American Airlines were lower in pre-market trading after the company cut its guidance on second profit as softer demand is expected to dent revenue.\n\nThe Texas-based carrier now expects second-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.15 per share, compared with its previous forecast of between $1.15 and $1.45 per share.\n\nIt forecast total revenue per available seat mile, a proxy for pricing power, to be down about 5% to 6% from a year ago. That compares with a decline of 1% to 3% expected earlier.\n\nThe airline also announced that its chief commercial officer, Vasu Raja, will leave the company next month. He has been in the role since April 2022.\n\nAmerican Airlines said its vice chair and chief strategy officer Stephen Johnson will take on Raja’s brief with immediate effect.\n\nWatch: Nvidia aiming beyond chips with AI ecosystem</p><p>Nvidia's shares have surged nearly 13% since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split.</p><p>Speaking with Reuters' Lisa Bernhard, Mahn noted how the \\\"AI poster child\\\" is looking to \\\"invest massively in their data center business and provide holistic AI solutions as opposed to [just] the chips component.\\\"</p><p>As for Apple, whose shares this year have lagged its megacap tech peers, Mahn said that while he expects it to invest heavily in AI, \\\"I don't anticipate any significant [stock] price performance over the short term while they're making those types of investments.\\\"</p><p>Apple shares were down in afternoon trading despite data showing an uptick in iPhone sales in China.</p><p>Mahn also discussed Tuesday's surprisingly strong consumer confidence data, adding that with stubborn inflation and a rising unemployment rate he doesn't see \\\"what they're so optimistic about.\\\"\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DACi2RhTziaYdK4ik2uuug--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/5fa2c21e78fd194e2496b47d7c778cd8\",\"duration\":\"PT4M26S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/516f0b23-02f4-3c28-9434-1fd5f6ae61fb.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-aiming-beyond-chips-ai-204009699.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"516f0b23-02f4-3c28-9434-1fd5f6ae61fb\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "A 'robust' earnings outlook is driving further optimism for stocks in 2024",
        "content": "The outlook for the stock market's most important driver just keeps getting better.\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC) earnings grew 6% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to data from FactSet. When excluding dismal earnings from Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), the results were even better, with earnings growing 10%, per Bank of America.\n\nThis comes as earnings estimates for future quarters are on the rise too. Consensus now sees earnings growing 11.4% in 2024, up from a projection of 10.9% on April 5. In 2025, earnings growth estimates have moved up to 14.2% in 2025 from the 11.6% growth seen that day.\n\nOn Tuesday, UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub boosted his year-end S&P 500 target to 5,600 from 5,400, citing \"stronger earnings.\"\n\n\"While subsequent quarter earnings estimates typically decline during earnings season, [second quarter] estimates have also been quite robust,\" Golub wrote. \"A similar pattern is also evident in full year 2024 estimates. These trends all support further market upside.\"\n\nEarnings are one of several reasons Wall Street strategists have been boosting their S&P 500 year-end targets. Golub and others have noted that economic \"tail risks\" have declined, with consensus estimates for economic growth increasing throughout the year.\n\nDeutsche Bank's chief global strategist Binky Chadha recently told Yahoo Finance that further growth than expected in the economy could help the S&P 500 reach 6,000 by the end of the year. But for his current target of 5,500, a large part of the case is built around earnings growth that is \"accelerating, and continues to accelerate.\"\n\n\"We see the earnings cycle having plenty of legs,\" Chadha wrote in a research note boosting his year-end S&P 500 target to 5,550 from 5,100 on May 17. \"While all the growth may not materialize this year, we see market confidence in a continued recovery rising by year-end, supporting equity multiples.\"\n\nChadha, like other strategists, had been looking for a rotation in earnings growth to begin in the first quarter, with Big Tech's growth starting to slow and other areas catching up. That didn't quite happen. A basket of stocks Chadha tracks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" grew about 39% compared to the year prior, roughly flat from the 40% year-over-year growth seen in the previous quarter.\n\nThis isn't an issue in itself, per Chadha. He believes the robust earnings growth seen in this group, which includes the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE), is \"extremely likely to slow at some point.\" And that will come as positive developments have been brewing under the surface in other pockets of the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings for Cyclicals and Defensives grew at a 7.5% clip in the first quarter, which Chadha noted is \"healthy.\" Other strategists believe a similar catch-up scenario is set to take place in earnings growth throughout the rest of this year.\n\nBank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon highlighted in a recent research note that Nvidia drove 37% of the S&P 500's earnings growth over the past 12 months. In the next 12 months, it's expected to represent just 9%.\n\n\"We don't think it's just about Nvidia anymore,\" Kwon told Yahoo Finance. \"Things are broadening out ... To power, commodities, utilities, things like that.\"\n\nStrategists like Kwon say the most notable blip in the fundamental story for stocks has been cost-cutting driving earnings growth, not increased demand and booming revenues. Kwon and Bank of America remain steadfast in their belief this will change later this year as companies in the industrial sector have signaled they believe they've hit the trough of declining demand in their cycle.\n\n\"In the second half of the year, we're gonna start seeing that demand recover,\" Kwon said. \"And with that, we're gonna see operating leverage and better margins.\"\n\nCharles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon noted that this will be a key trend for investors throughout the year. In the first quarter, companies that beat estimates for revenue outperformed those that just beat estimates on earnings.\n\nTo Gordon, this was the market singling out companies that were just increasing earnings through cost-cutting.\n\n\"The market tends to sniff [cost-cutting] out and say at some point, OK, now we have to actually see real demand come back online,\" Gordon told Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Better Stock-Split Buy: Nvidia or Chipotle?",
        "content": "Step aside, Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). There's a more heavily anticipated stock split on the way now. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced in its first-quarter update last week that it plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split effective June 7, 2024. Chipotle's board of directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split in March that's expected to take effect on June 26, 2024.\n\nNvidia has been the bigger winner by far so far this year. The GPU maker's shares have skyrocketed more than 125% compared to a gain of more than 35% for Chipotle. But which is the better stock-split buy now: Nvidia or Chipotle?\n\nForget about the stock splits\n\nFirst things first: Forget about the stock splits. I know many investors get excited about them and I led off this article talking about them, but they're practically meaningless.\n\nSure, both Nvidia and Chipotle stocks will soon sport lower share prices. And maybe this will entice some retail investors to buy. The reality, though, is that anyone who wanted to invest less the price of one share in Nvidia and Chipotle could have already done so. How? Many online brokers offer the opportunity to buy fractional shares of top stocks.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that stock splits don't always provide nice catalysts for a stock's price. And when they do, the gains are often temporary.\n\nMost importantly, though, stock splits change nothing about a company's underlying business. Stock splits merely increase the number of outstanding shares and lower the price of each share. That's it.\n\nHow Nvidia and Chipotle stack up against each other\n\nNonetheless, the upcoming stock splits for Nvidia and Chipotle could stoke interest in both stocks. How do they stack up against each other? Let's start with each company's financial position.\n\nNvidia reported Q1 revenue of $26 billion, up 262% over the result in the prior-year period. The company posted a profit of nearly $15 billion, soaring 628% year over year. Nvidia's cash stockpile topped $31.4 billion as of April 28.\n\nChipotle's Q1 revenue jumped 14.1% year over year to $2.7 billion. Its earnings rose 13.3% to $359.3 million. The restaurant operator had cash and cash equivalents totaling nearly $727.4 million as of March 31.\n\nMoving on to growth prospects, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings will grow by nearly 43% annually on average over the next five years. Analysts look for Chipotle's earnings to increase by around 22% annually during the same period.\n\nWhat about valuation? Nvidia's shares trade at a lofty 41.5 times forward earnings estimates. However, the stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a more reasonable 1.35. Meanwhile, Chipotle's forward earnings multiple of 58.8 and PEG ratio of 2.72 are even higher than Nvidia's multiples.\n\nStory continues\n\nI doubt that income investors will find either stock appealing. However, Nvidia does offer a dividend whereas Chipotle doesn't. Nvidia also recently announced a 150% increase to its dividend payout.\n\nBetter stock-split buy?\n\nThis decision appears to be an easy one. Nvidia's financials are more impressive than Chipotle's. The giant chipmaker has stronger growth prospects. Its valuation is more attractive. Nvidia even offers a small dividend. It's the hands-down winner, in my view.\n\nJust because Nvidia is a better pick than Chipotle, though, doesn't automatically make it the best stock to buy right now. As great as Nvidia is, I think other stocks could be even bigger winners over the next few years. These stocks might not have stock splits on the way, but that doesn't matter one bit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday as market participants were assessing the Fed decision regarding the trajectory of the benchmark interest rate in 2024. Investors were also watching mixed economic data. The Nasdaq Composite surged while the Dow tumbled last day. The S&P 500 ended\n\nHow Did The Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) slid 0.6% or 216.73 points to close at 38,852.86. 20 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory, while 10 in positive zone.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 17.019.88, rising 0.6% due to strong performance by U.S. technology behemoths. The tech-laden index recorded its first ever closing above the crucial technical barrier of 17,000. In intraday day trading, Nasdaq Composite posted an all-time high of 17,032.66.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 1.32 points to finish at 5,306.04. Eight out of 11 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in negative territory, while three in positive zone. The Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) declined 1.1%, 1.2% and 1.2%, respectively. On the other hand, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) advanced 1%.\r\n\r\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 4.5% to 12.92. A total of 11.91 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.32 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.75-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.\n\nSemiconductors Gain\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) rose 1.9% buoyed by blockbuster first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results of NVIDIA Corp. NVDA. NVIDIA ensures artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy is yet to unfold. The AI market has gathered pace in the past few years buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet. These astonishing results were primarily due to sky-high shipments of NVIDIA’s Hopper graphics processors, especially H100 GPU.\r\n\r\nThe stock price of NVIDIA jumped 7%. Consequently, stock prices of other semiconductor giants like Micron Technology Inc. MU, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD and QUALCOMM Inc. QCOM advanced 2.5%, 3.2% and 1.3%, respectively. NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRate Cut Hope Evaporates\n\nThe CME FedWatch currently assigned a 56% probability that the Fed will cut the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in November and a 77.5% chance that the fed fund rate will be reduced by 25 basis points in December. Expectations of more than one rate cut is a distant possibility now.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomic Data\n\nThe Conference Reported that the consumer confidence index for May came in at 102%, beating the consensus estimate of 96%. The metric for April was revised upward to 97.5% from 97% reported earlier. The Present Situation sub-index—based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions—increased to 143.1% in May from 140.6% in April.\r\n\r\nThe Expectations sub-index—based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions—rose to 74.6% in May from 68.8% last month. However, the metric stayed below 80%, the threshold which usually signals a recession ahead.\r\n\r\nThe S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 6.5% annual gain for March, the same increase as the previous month. The 10-City Composite saw an increase of 8.2%, up from an 8.1% increase in the previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a slight year-over-year increase to 7.4%, up from a 7.3% increase in the previous month.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Futures lower, Salesforce to report - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures point lower following a mixed session on Wall Street on Tuesday, with traders keeping a close eye on upcoming inflation data later this week. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)'s Data Cloud unit is set to be in the spotlight when the business software company reports its latest quarterly results after the bell, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) cuts its outlook for the current three-month period. Elsewhere, BHP requests an extension to a looming deadline facing its negotiations over a multi-billion pound takeover of rival Anglo American (JO:AGLJ).\n\n1. Futures lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged down on Wednesday, as investors looked ahead to key inflation data later this week that could influence how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nBy 03:38 ET (07:38 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had shed 21 points or 0.4%, Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 70 points or 0.4%, and Dow futures had dropped by 168 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed higher in the prior session thanks in part to a jump in shares in artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A closely-watched monitor of semiconductors added 1.9%, boosting the benchmark S&P 500. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped, weighed down by an uptick in U.S. Treasury yields.\n\nTraders are awaiting the release of the monthly personal consumption expenditures price index on Friday. The figure is widely considered to be the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, meaning it could factor into how policymakers regard the trajectory of price gains. Signs of sticky inflation have led several officials to suggest in recent days that they would like to see more evidence of cooling prices before starting to bring rates down from more than two-decade highs.\n\n2. Salesforce to report\n\nSalesforce is due to report its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with Wall Street likely on the lookout for updates on the business software group's Data Cloud division.\n\nThe unit stands to be a beneficiary of a boom in interest in artificial intelligence. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that they expect demand for the segment to \"remain strong\" partly due to Salesforce's ability to \"enhance its products via AI.\"\n\nData Cloud's fourth-quarter annual recurring revenue neared $400 million, growing by almost 90% versus the year-ago period. Salesforce President Brian Millham told investors in February that the result \"should be an indicator of the demand that we're seeing for people to get ready for the AI transformation they want to put their company through.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, market observers have flagged that California-based Salesforce still faces headwinds from uncertainty hovering over the broader economic backdrop and a recovery in spending by inflation-squeezed small- and medium-sized companies.\n\n3. American Airlines slashes second-quarter earnings outlook\n\nShares in American Airlines slumped in extended hours trading after the carrier warned that it expects to earn less per share in the current quarter.\n\nThe company lowered its forecast for second-quarter earnings per share to between $1.00 to $1.15, down from $1.15 to $1.45 previously. Total revenue per available seat mile, or TRASM, is also now expected to fall by 5% to 6%, versus a prior estimate for a decline of 1% to 3%.\n\nQuarterly flying capacity is now forecast to match the corresponding three-month period in 2023. American had said that the number would increase by 7% to 9%.\n\nMeanwhile, the firm announced the departure of Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja in June.\n\n4. BHP asks for extension in Anglo American takeover talks\n\nBHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said it would need more time to hold negotiations with Anglo American, as a deadline for the Australian miner to submit a formal takeover offer for its rival loomed large.\n\nLast week, London-listed Anglo rejected a bid from BHP that was reportedly worth 38.6 billion pounds. The firms now have until 5 p.m. London time on Wednesday to reach an agreement, following a week-long extension of a prior deadline.\n\nIn a statement to Australia's securities exchange, BHP said that the extension would allow for \"further engagement on its proposal.\"\n\nBHP, the world's largest listed mining group, has put forward a range of measures to alleviate Anglo's concerns regarding the deal structure, which includes Anglo unbundling its platinum and iron ore assets in South Africa.\n\n\"BHP is confident that the measures it has proposed to the Board of Anglo American provide a viable pathway to resolve the matters raised by Anglo American,\" it said.\n\nCNBC has reported that Anglo American said it would respond to BHP's request in \"due time.\"\n\n5. Crude gains prior to U.S. inventory data\n\nCrude prices rose Wednesday, adding to recent gains on hopes that demand will pick up with the onset of the travel-heavy U.S. summer season ahead of a meeting by major producers to decide future output levels.\n\nBy 03:34 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.5% higher at $80.20 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.4% to $84.25 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks gained over 1% on Tuesday.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, is set to take place online over the weekend, and the group is expected to extend its current voluntary output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day into the second half of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Memorial Day holiday on Monday signaled the start of the peak demand season in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, supporting sentiment in the market. Upcoming inventory data is expected to further the notion of growing demand, with analysts predicting a 2 million barrel draw in overall inventories.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures lower, Salesforce to report - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ policymaker hints at rate hike if yen's impact on inflation is big\n\nIMF upgrades China's 2024, 2025 GDP growth forecasts but warns of risks ahead\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Wednesday, weighed by persistent concerns that sticky inflation will push major central banks into keeping interest rates high for longer.\n\nChinese markets were somewhat of an exception, advancing slightly after the government announced more measures to support the beleaguered property sector.\n\nRegional stocks took middling overnight cues from Wall Street, which was boosted chiefly by a rally in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which in turn pushed the NASDAQ Composite to record highs.\n\nBut beyond tech, broader U.S. stocks were muted in anticipation of key inflation data due later this week. Federal Reserve officials also kept up their hawkish commentary on interest rates.\n\nU.S. stock index futures were flat in Asian trade.\n\nAustralia sinks on inflation shock, RBA jitters\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 index was among the worst performers in Asia, sinking 1% after consumer price index inflation data read stronger than expected for April.\n\nThe reading marked a second straight month of increased inflation, and drummed up concerns over a more hawkish Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nSticky inflation could push the RBA into keep rates high for longer, or even potentially raising rates further this year, as it moves to bring down inflation.\n\nThe central bank had considered a rate hike in its May meeting, and had signaled that it would not rule out any measures to bring down sticky inflation.\n\nJapanese stocks hit by mixed BOJ signals\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 0.3%, while the broader TOPIX index lost 0.5% on Wednesday.\n\nBank of Japan member Adachi Seiji warned that excessive declines in the yen could attract policy tightening by the central bank, especially if it impacted inflation.\n\nAdachi also forecast that inflation would pick up in the summer-autumn period, and that the BOJ will gradually phase out its stimulative asset purchase programs.\n\nBut he warned against any quick increases in interest rates, due to risks to Japan’s economy, and stressed on the need to keep policy accommodative in the near-term.\n\nBroader Asian stocks also retreated, as anticipation of more cues on U.S. inflation and interest rates battered sentiment.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.9%, while futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a negative open, with the index set for more profit-taking after hitting record highs this week.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index slid nearly 1% on profit-taking in technology stocks, which offset gains in the property sector.\n\nChinese stocks rise on more property support\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes were the sole gainers in Asia on Wednesday, rising 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nA slew of major Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen, were seen further loosening restrictions on home buying and lending requirements for property investment.\n\nThe measures come just weeks after Beijing announced a swathe of supportive measures for the property market, a slowdown in which has been a major point of contention for the Chinese economy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall on inflation jitters, China buoyed by more stimulus\n\nFactbox-Over 713,000 customers without power in Texas, other states from storms\n\nBrazil's Congress advances bill to tax low-cost online orders\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 27.3% of the Entire S&amp;P 500 Index",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is composed of 500 stocks from 11 different sectors, including information technology, energy, financials, and real estate. While it is the most diversified of the major U.S. stock market indexes, a select few technology stocks are having a growing influence over its performance thanks to their meteoric rise in value.\n\nAs of this writing, the following five companies have a combined market capitalization of $12.5 trillion, accounting for 27.3% of the total value of the entire S&P 500:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $2.9 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $2.8 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $1.9 trillion.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is up 11.5% in 2024 so far. However, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index -- which assigns an equal weighting to every stock regardless of its market cap -- is up just 4.9%. The difference can be explained (in large part) by the average year-to-date gain of 26.3% in the above five stocks, which highlights their influence over the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are using that experience (and their vast financial resources) to dominate new industries like artificial intelligence (AI). If they succeed, they could become even more influential over the S&P 500.\n\n1. Microsoft: 7.2% of the S&P 500\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company. It was founded in 1975, and some of its flagship products like Windows and Word are still used by billions of people today. Microsoft has expanded beyond software and into gaming, hardware (computers and devices), internet search, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the company agreed to invest $10 billion in AI start-up OpenAI, which created the ChatGPT online chatbot. Microsoft is integrating OpenAI's technology into most of its products to deliver more value for users. The Bing search engine, for example, now features a chatbot interface, and applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel are benefiting from AI's ability to rapidly craft content from text to videos.\n\nMicrosoft has cemented itself as a leader in AI thanks to the OpenAI partnership, and its products will continue to benefit from the start-up's lightning-paced innovation.\n\n2. Apple: 6.2% of the S&P 500\n\nApple makes some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, with 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. That includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. The iPhone also led to successful, billion-dollar spinoff devices like the Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's enormous installed base makes it the perfect distributor of AI software to consumers. The latest iPhone 15 Pro already comes with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, designed to process some AI workloads on-device. The company is reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet to decide which AI models will power its future devices, so consumers should expect its next iteration of chips to come with even greater processing capabilities.\n\nEventually, devices like the iPhone might come with advanced AI assistants capable of answering complex questions and crafting emails and social media content (among other things). Modern smartphones are simply pocket-sized computers, and, generally speaking, they have made humanity far more productive. AI is set to accelerate that trend.\n\n3. Nvidia: 5.9% of the S&P 500\n\nGenerative AI is developed, trained, and deployed in large, centralized data centers. Nvidia designs the graphics processing chips (GPUs) that fill those data centers, and they are the most sought-after in the industry among AI developers. During fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to $47.5 billion, which was a whopping 217% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company just reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), and growth in its data center revenue accelerated to 427%. The H100 buoyed sales, but shipments of the new H200 GPU are set to begin in Q2. It can inference (the process of feeding live data to an AI model so it can make predictions) twice as fast as the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which could trigger another demand wave from leading data center operators like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\n\nIn essence, Nvidia remains far ahead of its competitors, and the development of next-generation AI models won't be possible without its GPUs. The company plans to launch a new series of chips later this year that are built on its latest Blackwell architecture, and they will deliver even greater performance.\n\n4. Alphabet: 4.3% of the S&P 500\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, and it's also home to other tech subsidiaries like YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and AI developer DeepMind. Google Search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue, but investors have questioned whether AI chatbots could unseat its dominance, given their ability to provide an instant answer to practically any question.\n\nData is king when it comes to AI, and since Google Search has been the window to the entire internet for more than two decades, it has more valuable information than practically any company on Earth. This allowed Alphabet to develop its own AI models, culminating in its latest Gemini lineup, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 models. In some tests, Gemini is as good, if not better, at understanding and generating text, images, videos, and computer code.\n\nGoogle also embedded generative AI into its traditional search engine, which provides the user with a text-based answer at the top of the page to save them from sifting through web results to find the information they need. Alphabet's AI initiatives are resonating with investors, who have catapulted the company into the exclusive $2 trillion club this year.\n\n5. Amazon: 3.7% of the S&P 500\n\nAmazon is best known as an e-commerce company, and online sales remain its largest source of revenue. But the company has branched out into streaming, digital advertising, robotics, and cloud computing (among other things), which have all contributed to the company's position on this list. In fact, its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the biggest in the industry, and it's home to a growing number of AI services.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy wants AWS to dominate the three layers of AI. There is the infrastructure layer, the model layer, and the application layer. To achieve this, the company now designs its own AI chips for the data center, it offers a growing portfolio of ready-made large language models (LLMs), including some it developed in-house, and it recently launched a generative AI assistant called Q, which can help businesses extract more value from the AWS platform.\n\nAmazon also uses AI in its core e-commerce platform to recommend products to customers and to help advertisers craft engaging content. Simply put, this is one of the most diversified companies an investor can own during the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Tuesday after a rally in market darling Nvidia drove the Nasdaq to new highs, with focus remaining on upcoming inflation data and more cues on interest rates.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) extended some gains into aftermarket trade after surging some 7% during the session on hype over artificial intelligence. The stock was now nearing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second-largest listed firm on Wall Street.\n\nBut this did not translate into strength in Wall Street futures, as broader stocks remained subdued on growing caution over U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,321.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures steadied at 18,939.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,898.0 points.\n\nNvidia drives Nasdaq to record highs, but broader sentiment subdued\n\nGains in Nvidia saw the NASDAQ Composite rise 0.6% to a record high of 17,019.88 points on Tuesday. The stock was boosted chiefly by hype over AI, especially after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk raised $6 billion for his AI venture.\n\nNvidia is the third-largest stock on Wall Street, and also helped the S&P 500 close marginally higher, although the index remained well below recent peaks.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average- which is more economically sensitive than its peers, fell 0.6% to 38,852.86 points.\n\nRate jitters mount amid hawkish Fedspeak, PCE watch\n\nBroader U.S. stocks were largely subdued in anticipation of key inflation data this week. PCE price index data, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, is due this Friday, and is likely to factor into the central bank’s outlook on interest rates.\n\nBefore that, hawkish warnings from Fed officials continued to pour in. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned on Tuesday that the Fed had still not ruled out rate hikes, especially in the face of sticky inflation.\n\nMore Fed officials, including New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are set to speak before Friday’s PCE reading.\n\nThe Fed’s Beige Book report is due on Wednesday, while a revised reading on first-quarter economic growth is also due on Thursday.\n\nAfterhours movers: American Airlines dips, Robinhood jumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) sank over 6% after it cut its second-quarter earnings forecast on a more subdued outlook on travel demand.\n\nThis pulled down broader airline stocks, with Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) and Spirit Airlines Inc (NYSE:SAVE) down between 0.8% to 2.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) rose 4.3% after it unveiled a stock buyback of $1 billion.\n\nMeme stock GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) fell 1.7% after surging 25% during the session on raising $933 million in share sales.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after Nvidia rally; Fed cues in focus\n\nUS judge rejects Amazon bid to get FTC lawsuit tossed over Prime program\n\nAmid merger speculation, Brazilian airline Gol parent talks with Azul\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Soaring Today",
        "content": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 7.5% in the afternoon session after continued strong momentum following a strong earnings report last week. This helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high. The tech-heavy index crossed the 17,000 mark.\n\nThere was also some positive news over the weekend. The Information reported that Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, announced plans to buy Nvidia's AI chips for its new supercomputer. On Monday, May 27, 2024, xAI announced its series B funding round on the social media platform X.com (formerly called Twitter). The AI start-up raised $ 6 billion to \"take xAI's first products to market\" and to \"build advanced Infrastructure.\" According to the reports, it is likely that the development of the infrastructure will birth a massive computing system - dubbed \"the Gigafactory of computing\" - which is expected to use 100,000 semiconductors based on NVDA's H100 GPU, and with an estimated size exceeding 4x the biggest cluster in existence.\n\nOverall, the report suggested that it is still early days in the hot AI market while providing more definitive insight into the growing demand for Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 11.2% on the news that the company reported first quarter earnings results. Nvidia recorded healthy gross margin improvement, indicating elevated pricing power. Its revenue and EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in its data center and automotive segments; the result in its automotive segment (17% year-on-year revenue growth) was especially impressive given the industry is in a cyclical downturn and many other semiconductor companies have posted year-on-year declines for that end market.\n\nLastly, its inventory levels increased, likely due to the company stocking up on products in anticipation of strong demand. During the announcement of the results, Nvidia issued a 10-1 stock split that will commence on Friday, June 7, 2024. Looking ahead, Nvidia's revenue for the next quarter beat expectations again. Overall, this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is up 136% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $31,676.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Zaheer Kachwala\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia's shares rallied around 6% to hit a record high on Tuesday, leaving the AI chipmaker's stock market value about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple in a major reshuffle of Wall street's biggest players.\n\nLast trading at $1,128, Nvidia's market capitalization reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, which is Wall Street's second-most valuable company after Microsoft.\n\nIts stock surged as much as 8% to $1,149.39 during the session, an intra-day record high. Apple's stock was down 0.2% in afternoon trading.\n\nNvidia's shares have surged nearly 13% since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split, which excited investors as they continue to bet on the AI poster child.\n\n\"The market has been struggling to keep up with the company's ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesn't feel like bubble territory,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nNvidia recently traded at 36 times its forward profit estimates, compared with 38 for Advanced Micro Devices and 21 for Intel, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company's shares have more than doubled so far this year after more than tripling last year.\n\nNvidia, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, reported a five-fold jump in revenue at its data center segment last week as customers line up for their high-performance chips.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com and other technology companies have been competing for a limited supply of Nvidia's high-end chips as they race to dominate AI computing.\n\n\"Business is doing incredibly well, there are so many opportunities to keep growing, and the AI theme still has legs. When the song is that catchy, investors want to keep humming it all day long, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell when asked about the stock's rally.\n\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple has underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling around 2% this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China.\n\nMicrosoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company earlier this year as it raced ahead of other tech firms due to gains made by early investments in artificial intelligence across its cloud services.\n\nMicrosoft's shares were down 0.4% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of $3.1 trillion.\n\nApple has also been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "If You Can Only Buy One Dividend Stock in May, It Better Be One of These 3 Names",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are making a comeback in portfolios after a period where higher interest rates made fixed-income options more attractive to income investors. As these investors return to dividend stocks, the criteria for selecting the best options have evolved — a trend that applies to most stock segments today.\n\nFor instance, today’s growth-oriented investors now demand stronger financial and fundamental credentials than in the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) era, when any company forecasting significant future profits could easily attract investor funds, regardless of its underlying financial management. Now, investors are more cautious, avoiding speculative stocks with a more critical eye.\n\nThis shift also affects dividend stocks, albeit in a somewhat different way. While seeking greater stability in growth stocks, investors now expect long-term growth potential from their value investments. Although short-term Treasuries still offer yields over 5%, income-producing stocks must either provide a higher yield or the prospect of long-term capital gains — or both! — to stand out from the competition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealthy, sustained dividends alongside long-term price appreciation potential are the best hallmarks of dividend stocks to buy. Few dividend stocks meet this high bar better than Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), which offers a perfect mix of stability and growth potential. As a top pick for long-term investing, Medtronic’s sector dominance and dividend status distinguish it from the competition.\n\nMedtronic’s collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostic tool highlights its unique position at the intersection of growth and stability. Additionally, Medtronic’s CEO Geoff Martha recently emphasized the strategic use of AI to enhance clinical decisions, innovate new treatment indicators and personalize patient care. He seeks to position the company at the forefront of AI integration in medical technology.\n\nMedtronic’s most recent filing points to the firm’s strength moving forward, including 5% sales growth and improved profitability. Better yet, for those looking for dividend stocks to buy, Medtronic also boosted its dividend to 70 cents per share quarterly — its 47th consecutive year of increases.\n\nH&R Block (HRB) Image of a yellow building featuring the H&R Block (HRB) logo\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough we’ve moved beyond tax season (unless you’re a late filer), H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) remains one of the best dividend stocks to buy year-round. Moving beyond the inherently cyclical nature of tax software, H&R Block is diversifying its revenue streams to ensure steady cash flow throughout the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo mitigate the seasonal nature of the tax sector, H&R Block launched a mobile banking service that has seen quick success and continued growth. The company snagged $456 million in net customer deposits and a total of 316,000 customer signups in less than two years, pointing to a gap in a market primed for H&R Block to fill. Additionally, H&R Block is leveraging new technologies for more efficient tax filing moving forward, collaborating with industry-heavyweight Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on an AI-powered tax assistance product.\n\nH&R Block’s status as a must-buy dividend stock is further solidified by its impressive 10% total yield, or a respectable 2.5% dividend yield. The rest comprises stock buybacks. This substantial yield, supported by a modest 33% payout ratio, indicates that H&R Block retains a considerable portion of its earnings for growth initiatives while still providing significant rewards to its shareholders.\n\nVICI Properties (VICI) a woman smiling while using a slot machine in a casino. representing gambling stocks\n\nSource: Maridav/Shutterstock, Inc.\n\nReady for a Las Vegas vacation? Dividend stock to buy VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) owns and occasionally operates multiple famous Vegas properties, including Caesar’s Palace, the Venetian, and MGM Grand. This impressive portfolio alone makes VICI a compelling investment, as Vegas will unlikely lose its global appeal anytime soon.\n\nThe REIT went public in 2017, following Caesars Entertainment’s (NASDAQ:CZR) bankruptcy proceedings. While Caesars Entertainment still operates Caesars Palace, VICI owns the land and property itself. It collects cash on gambler and tourist trades with much less operational risk than the underlying business model its tenants rely upon.\n\nSince its IPO, the dividend stock returned 60%, with gross returns exceeding 120% when including distributions. Over the past seven years, VICI has maintained a solid dividend yield of around 5%, with the current 12-month trailing yield at 5.8%. This competitive yield and growth potential make VICI a top pick among dividend stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Tech Stocks That Overpromise and Underdeliver: 3 Names to Avoid",
        "content": "Technology stocks continue to outperform and power the market higher. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq Composite index that is laden with tech securities is up 15%, bringing its 12-month gain to 30%. That’s ahead of both the benchmark S&P 500 index and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. But while the sector as a whole continues to outperform, there are several overhyped tech stocks that are lagging behind.\n\nThe main reason why some tech stocks are in the red while the rest of the market is in the green is that the companies behind the securities have failed to deliver on the promises they made. Financial results have missed targets, forward guidance has been lowered and new products haven’t materialized when expected. This has hurt investor sentiment and led analysts to revise their outlooks downward for these stocks.\n\nTo avoid falling victim to overhyped tech stocks, investors should take a good look at each of the companies on this list. Paying attention to current financials and where a company may be heading in the future can prevent costly investment mistakes in this highly volatile market segment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nHas any tech company overpromised and underdelivered as much as microchip and semiconductor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)? The company just delivered the latest in a series of disappointing quarterly financial reports, sending its share price down 8% as a result. Intel continues to struggle as it pivots to becoming a microchip foundry and not just a designer of chips and semiconductors. Not even $8.5 billion in funding through the U.S. government’s CHIPS and Science Act has helped the company.\n\nEarlier this year, Intel unveiled a new artificial intelligence (AI) microchip called the Gaudi 3 that the company says can be used to train and deploy big AI models and chatbots. In launching the Gaudi 3 chip, Intel said that it is over twice as power-efficient and one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing H100 microchip. Investors seem skeptical of the claims and that Intel will be able to deliver with the new chip.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), INTC stock is down 35% and one of the worst-performing securities listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index. It might be one of the most well-known names in the industry, but it’s also one of the top overhyped tech stocks right now.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nVideo game maker Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) saw its share price plunge 22% after the video game developer delivered forward guidance that fell far short of Wall Street expectations. The one-day drop in the company’s share price was the largest since 2022 and brings RBLX stock to a loss of 24% on the year. Since going public in March 2021, Roblox stock has fallen 53%. Roblox did manage to report strong first-quarter financial results.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company behind the popular online video game platform posted a Q1 loss of 43 cents, which beat a loss of 53 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $923.8 million, up 19% from a year earlier and above analyst estimates of $919 million. But the forward guidance sank the stock. Roblox said it expects revenue of $870 million to $900 million in the current second quarter, below analyst calls for $929 million.\n\nAt an investor day last year, Roblox’s management team said they planned to deliver 20% revenue growth over the next few years. Those growth projections now seem in doubt.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDisappointing earnings are becoming a pattern at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company’s share price just fell 8% after it yet again reported quarterly billings that missed Wall Street targets. Specifically, Palo Alto Networks’ billings for the year’s first three months came in at $2.33 billion, just missing analysts’ average estimate of $2.34 billion. While the latest print was not as bad as the previous one that really torpedoed PANW stock, it wasn’t the comeback investors wanted.\n\nAnalysts and investors see the disappointing billings as a sign of reduced corporate spending on cybersecurity solutions, creating near-term headwinds for Palo Alto Networks. Corporate America is spending less on cybersecurity as firms struggle with inflation and an uncertain economic outlook, said Palo Alto executives. For the entire year, the company expects billings of $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion. That guidance is slightly lower than a previous range of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion.\n\nPANW stock is up 7.5% on the year but trading 18% below its 52-week high and trailing rival cybersecurity firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Do Hedge Funds Like D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS) As A Quantum Computing Play?",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS) stands against the other quantum computing stocks.\n\nThese days, artificial intelligence is one of the hottest topics on the stock market and the media. This is because of the improvements in data analysis and decision making offered by AI models. These have augmented pre AI data analysis and text production technologies, and consequently, Wall Street has piled billions of dollars into the industry.\n\nAs AI is to data science, quantum computing is to classical computing. Or at least in some aspects. The fundamental difference between a classical and quantum computer is physics. Classical computers operate under the principles of classic physics, which means that it is easy to determine whether a semiconductor's processor is in the on (1) or off (0) state. In quantum computing's case, a transistor's equivalent is an elemental particle capable of existing in multiple states. So, a quantum 'transistor' could be on and off at the same time, to provide programmers with more flexibility to solve problems.\n\nThis ability to process more inputs means that quantum computing offers complex problems that traditional computers might not have enough capacity for. This is one reason that some estimates expect the quantum computing industry to be worth a modest $11.4 billion by 2027 despite a rapid compounded annual growth rate of 33%.\n\nAt the same time, quantum computing stocks are riskier than even traditional and typically high growth companies. This is because their products do not have sizeable markets and require considerable investment and research and development expenditure which might even take longer to recover than for biotechnology stocks.\n\nThese facts also make it trickier to analyze quantum computing stock performance since there are considerably fewer publicly traded companies to offer the convenience of simply seeing how an exchange traded fund has performed. For instance, consider the holdings of the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM). Some of its top holdings include software firm MicroStrategy and the memory manufacturer Micron. Neither of these companies generates material income from making products that are essential for a quantum computer to perform. Another major holding is NVIDIA, and while it does make a product for a quantum processing unit's (QPU) quantum controller, most, if not all of its share price gains have been due to artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis means that we need to analyze individual quantum computing stocks to see how they have performed recently. Heading into the year's second half, investors have battled with high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, turmoil in banking, and euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence since 2022.\n\nSome quantum computing stocks that are commonly known are Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI),  IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS). Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.\n\nSo, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over \"which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,\" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th.\n\nA modern computer datacenter, running an advanced quantum computer system.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best quantum computing stocks, we first made a list of pure play quantum computing companies and those that make crucial products for the industry.  These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nD-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 12\n\nD-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS) is another Canadian quantum computing industry. It offers cloud based access to quantum computing resources along with other software services. The firm made a major announcement in May 2024 when it revealed that it had partnered up with the University of South California to further work on an efficient type of quantum computing called annealing quantum computing.\n\nBy March 2024, hedge fund filing data tracked by Insider Monkey revealed that 12 were D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS)'s stakeholders.\n\nOverall, QBTS ranks 7th among the 12 best quantum computing stocks to buy now. You can visit 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy to see the other quantum computing stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of quantum computing companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Elon Musk Is Getting Ready to Give Nvidia (NVDA) Stock a Giant Boost",
        "content": "Elon Musk hasn’t done much for his own company lately, but he’s about to send another tech stock soaring. Like most of the business world, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO has been focused on artificial intelligence (AI) lately. Specifically, he’s building out an xAI supercomputer, which he describes as the “gigafactory of compute.”\n\nThis will require some massive chip orders, and Musk wants to buy from the industry leader. According to The Information, the executive plans on ordering a significant amount of H100 GPUs made by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Now, NVDA stock is soaring as the company prepares for a lucrative partnership.\n\nWhat’s Happening With NVDA Stock?\n\nWhenever Musk partners with a company, shares tend to surge. That’s exactly what’s happening today. As of this writing, NVDA stock is up more than 6% for the day and looks primed to keep rising. After an impressive earnings beat last week and announcing plans for a 10-for-1 stock split, the AI leader has been enjoying solid momentum. News of the pending xAI partnership is poised to only take shares even further.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBig things are happening with Musk’s new venture. xAI recently received a $24 billion valuation after its latest fundraising round. That means Musk is forging ahead with plans to build out a startup that could change the face of the tech sector if it takes off.\n\nRight now, that’s excellent for Nvidia. As Business Insiderreports:\n\n“Nvidia’s expensive and coveted GPUs are essential for AI firms to train their large language models, and it takes a big cluster of them to do so. Musk needs a cluster to compete in the AI race — and he reportedly told investors that xAI’s would be more than four times as large as Meta’s.”\n\nFor Nvidia, this type of development is exactly what it needs to retain its place at the top of the AI race. As InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango notes, there is ample opportunity for anyone who partners with xAI as a supplier. Right now, that’s Nvidia. The leading chipmaker already has an impressive client list, but catering to Musk’s high-profile startup will set the firm up for even more growth in the coming year. That means NVDA stock will likely surge in the months ahead as well.\n\nxAI already rents Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) servers that include 16,000 chips from Nvidia. But when the firm starts buying chips itself as a means of powering its new supercomputer, the news should also power NVDA stock. That type of momentum could be enough to send AI stocks up across the board — with Nvidia leading the charge.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSamuel O’Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock just keeps rising. Today's jump of about 7% as of 1 p.m. ET wasn't due to any new information from the company. Nvidia released its quarterly earnings last week and the stock jumped on that news.\n\nBut today's move -- and the reason why Nvidia shares can keep moving higher -- comes from another company's announcement today. Nvidia's sales have been soaring, and now investors see another multibillion-dollar customer coming in Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nHow can Nvidia be worth so much?\n\nNvidia's stock took off when it started monetizing sales of its processors used for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Sales of its GPUs continue to rise, with the company saying its sees revenue more than doubling in the current quarter compared to the year-ago period.\n\nThose sales are going to a wide range of technology companies building AI large language models and vastly increasing computing power. Last year, the top customers for Nvidia's GPU offering included many well-known companies. Image source: Statista.\n\nBut while one Elon Musk company (Tesla) was on that list, another just announced it raised a fresh $6 billion in capital. And many expect much of the funds xAI just raised to be spent on Nvidia's processing chips.\n\nxAI is Musk's start-up working to develop artificial intelligence. It just announced a new funding round this weekend that raised $6 billion and values the private company at about $24 billion, according to Musk. Reports have indicated that xAI plans to build a supercomputer to power a new version of xAI's chatbot named Grok. xAI may partner with Oracle using what could be tens of thousands of Nvidia chips.\n\nWith xAI not even making the top dozen customers for Nvidia's H100 GPUs in 2023, the news is making investors bullish that the backlog of demand for Nvidia's AI chips has a long tail. That's why the stock remains a buy even after its recent run to a record level.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Tuesday, jumping as much as 5.6%. As of 11:54 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 5.1%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher was word that another AI start-up had raised billions of dollars, which is likely good news for Nvidia.\n\nHeavy spending on AI\n\nxAI, the AI start-up founded by Elon Musk, announced on Sunday it had raised $6 billion in its latest funding round. The company said in a blog post that the influx of cash would be used \"to take xAI's first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\" In a subsequent post on X (formerly Twitter), Musk said the series B funding round valued xAI at $18 billion.\n\nThe company, which was founded last July, is the creator of Grok, the generative AI chatbot that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Grok is available on X and is \"modeled after the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask!\"\n\nThe principal beneficiary\n\nSo what does all this have to do with Nvidia? It's a signal that there's still plenty of appetite for continued investment in AI. Investors have been worried that the demand for AI could fall off, but this helps illustrate that's not the case.\n\nAdditionally, since xAI is working to rival ChatGPT, the underlying large language models will require plenty of computational horsepower to bring Grok up to par. Since the company isn't developing AI chips of its own, the vast majority of the processors will likely come courtesy of Nvidia -- the industry leader -- which will directly boost the company's sales.\n\nThis comes on the heels of Nvidia's blockbuster financial report and upcoming 10-for-1 stock split. For the fourth consecutive quarter, the company delivered triple-digit revenue and profit gains and is guiding for more. This helps illustrate the ongoing demand for AI.\n\nFurthermore, at roughly 38 times forward earnings, Nvidia stock is still reasonably priced when viewed through the lens of its ongoing opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Last week was volatile for Wall Street. While the NVIDIA earnings-led AI boom drove the market in the first part of the week, hawkish Fed minutes tried to take the market in the opposite direction later on.  The Dow Jones saw a sharp 600-point drop on Thursday, marking its most substantial loss in more than a year.\n\nRenewed concerns over interest rates triggered Thursday's market turmoil. However, on Friday, Wall Street tried to recoup losses. Overall, the S&P 500 was up 0.03%, the Dow Jones lost 2.3% and the Nasdaq advanced 1.4%.\n\nShift in Fed Expectations\n\nStronger-than-anticipated U.S. business data prompted a reassessment of the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory, leading to a more divided outlook among traders. Some traders revised its forecast, indicating a delay in the Fed's anticipated rate cut, now targeting September instead of July.\n\nNVIDIA, following an impressive quarterly performance, continued its upward trajectory, rising 13.5% last week to around $1,064 per share. The upcoming stock split for NVIDIA is expected to stimulate further retail investor interest.\n\nEconomic Indicators\n\nA revised University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for May was released, showing a reading of 69.1.

        "title": "Ericsson (ERIC) Advances 5G Innovation for Industrial Automation",
        "content": "Ericsson ERIC recently announced that it has successfully tested an advanced 5G millimeter wave-powered drone in its USA 5G smart factory. The test was carried out in collaboration with Qualcomm and industrial drone solutions provider Dronus. Qualcomm’s QRB5165 processor was utilized in conjunction with Ericsson’s end-to-end private 5G network and 5G mmWave from Telit Cinterion.\r\n\r\nThis proof of concept marks the first instance when a natively mmWave 5G device is used in an industrial setup. It highlights a significant technological leap as it moves away from traditional wired or WiFi connections towards direct, high-speed 5G connections.\r\n\r\nWired connections, though reliable, reduce mobility, while WiFi provides mobility, but the Internet connection is less stable and slower. Moreover, having native 5G mmWave discards the need for external gateways or hotspots or any intermediary device to connect with the 5G network.\r\n\r\nThe built-in support for high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G technology makes it suitable for real-time applications. Its flight control system is optimized for indoor use, enabling it to navigate seamlessly within the factory, which usually has more obstacles and tight spaces compared to an outdoor setting. Equipped with live video streaming cameras, the drone efficiently performed autonomous inventory checks, focusing on high racks. This automated task is faster and more accurate than manual checks, which are very time-consuming and prone to human error.\r\n\r\nIndustries are increasingly moving toward automation in their factory and warehouse setups. The change is propelled by several factors, such as competitive pressure, the need for higher productivity, and to reduce operational costs. Substantial growth in e-commerce is driving the demand for efficient warehousing solutions. To respond more flexibly to market trends, businesses are investing in automation to streamline their supply chain. The industrial automation market is expected to witness a substantial uptick in the upcoming years. However, automation for high bandwidth intensive industrial use cases demands robust 5G networks.\r\n\r\nRecognizing these trends, Ericsson is focusing on developing 5G use cases to cater to advanced applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles. The recent successful demonstration certainly paves the groundwork for commercial usage of 5G mmWave devices in inventory management in the future. This will significantly boost ERIC’s commercial prospects in the long run.\r\n\r\nWith the emergence of the smartphone market and the subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased exponentially. Further, to maintain performance with increased traffic, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. The company is reportedly the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe company focuses on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself as a market leader. It believes that the standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitizing industries and broadband. Ericsson expects mainstream 4G offerings to give way to 5G technology in the future. It currently has 162 live 5G networks across the globe, spanning 69 countries.\r\n\r\nThe stock has gained 11.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 50%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\r\n\r\nEricsson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.43%, on average. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 11.48%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit.

        "content": "Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader\n\nSeasoned Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni, founder and CEO of Yardeni Research, has boldly rebranded the Magnificent Seven giants as the “Magnificent One,” referring only to Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the key driver of this year’s market gains.\n\nYardeni noted that the semiconductor giant has rallied by 115% year-to-date, more than three times as much as MetaPlatforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) – the top performer among the “Magnificent Six” – and more than 10 times as much as the broader S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).\n\n“Nvidia is the only clear beneficiary of the AI boom currently because everyone who wants to play has to pay for the company’s expensive GPU chips,” Yardeni said.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the heavy capital expenditures could affect the profitability of Nvidia’s clients, who may not all emerge as winners in the AI competition.\n\nRead also: AI-Driven Rally Set To Expand To Power, Commodities, Utilities: ‘It’s Not Just About Nvidia Anymore’\n\nChart: Nvidia Plays Its Own League In The Year-To-Date Ranking\n\nEconomic Implications Of The AI Expansion: The Roaring 2020s\n\n“In our Roaring 2020s scenario, the technology boom should continue to shrug off the Fed and power productivity, economic growth, and the stock market higher.”\n\nYardeni explained that the Fed's monetary policy is only one of several economic drivers, and they won't need to reduce rates to support economic growth if productivity increases.\n\nNvidia recently reported an “incredible earnings report,” with quarterly net income surging from $2.0 billion in the previous year to $14.9 billion.\n\n“That further confirms our thesis” of a Roaring 2020s scenario, Yardeni said.\n\nThe Wall Street veteran believes the market began to reflect the Roaring 2020s scenario on Nov. 30, 2022, with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Since then, Nvidia has propelled the S&P 500’s semiconductor indexes to new heights.\n\nYardeni assigns a 60% chance to the Roaring 2020s scenario, contrasting with a 20% probability of a “1990s market meltup” and another 20% of a “1970s repeat.”\n\n“Our Roaring 2020s scenario is right on track,” he said.\n\nYardeni’s Roaring 2020s scenario anticipates above-average growth in S&P 500 earnings, GDP, and productivity. Increased productivity is expected to reduce unit labor costs and inflation, continuing a trend that started last year. This ongoing trend, as forecasted, should elevate profit margins to unprecedented levels.\n\nLast week, the veteran investor forecasted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach 60,000 points and the S&P 500 would climb to 8,000 by the decade’s end, assuming the Roaring 2020s scenario materializes.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead now: Dow To Reach 60,000, S&P 500 To Hit 8,000 By 2030 In Wall Street Veteran’s ‘Roaring 2020s Scenario’\n\nPhoto gguy/Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Magnificent 7 Becomes 'The Magnificent One': Wall Street Guru Hails Single Tech Stock As Market Leader originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Recent blowout earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have amplified excitement in the tech trade. Investors are piling into tech stocks, in hopes of capturing growth and riding long-term momentum. Artificial intelligence and stocks of microchip and semiconductor companies, such as Nvidia, are proving to be especially hot right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) recently forecast 10% annual revenue growth for the worldwide microchip and semiconductor industry this year. TSMC, as the company is known, is the largest chip foundry in the world, making about 70% of the world’s chips and semiconductors. Clearly, chips are a good sector to be invested in.\n\nBut beyond Nvidia and semiconductors, there is a whole world of tech stocks out there that investors can put capital to work in. Here are tech up-and-comers: three under-the-radar stocks with 10X potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Gaithersburg MD June 26, 2021 Carvana (CVNA) Auto Dealership\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline used car retailer Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) had a difficult time during the 2022 bear market. Concerns that the company was taking on too much debt and the impact of high interest rates on car sales and loans sent CVNA stock plunging 98% peak to trough. Carvana stock fell from $360 to less than $5. The selloff was brutal.\n\nHowever, the company has managed to come storming back over the past year and continues to rally.\n\nIn the last 12 months, CVNA stock has risen nearly 700% and is again trading above $100 per share. So far in 2024, Carvana stock has more than doubled, having gained 123%. The company has been helped by a resilient economy and car market that has stabilized.\n\nIt has also gotten a lift from cost reductions and efficiency gains, which have resulted in record quarterly financial results. Carvana stock recently rallied 30% after the company issued its first-quarter print. More gains can be expected.\n\nAmphenol Corp. (APH) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor another way to play the microchip and semiconductor boom, consider Amphenol Corp. (NYSE:APH). The company produces the parts and equipment that the chip and semiconductor industry relies on. This includes electronic and fiber optic connectors, as well as coaxial cables.\n\nWhile it doesn’t get nearly as much attention as the other companies helping to drive the AI revolution, Amphenol has been a going concern since 1932.\n\nThe company began life as a maker of tube sockets and other parts found in radios. Today, Amphenol is enabling the rise of microchips and semiconductors that have been called the “oil of the 21st century.” APH stock has been on an upswing, rising about 40% this year and increasing about 77% in the last 12 months and gaining 213% in the past five years. The company also just announced a two-for-one stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmphenol stock is currently trading at an all-time high. But that shouldn’t deter investors as demand for its products is only growing.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) mu stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlso benefitting from the AI revolution is Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), the maker of memory and storage for computers that specializes in USB flash drives. MU stock caught fire after the company’s most recent earnings print beat Wall Street forecasts and included upbeat forward guidance. Year-to-date, Micron Technology stock is up 57% and one of the best-performing tech stocks of the year.\n\nFor Q1 this year, Micron reported EPS of 42 cents. Analysts had been expecting a loss of 25 cents a share. Revenue totaled $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion expected on Wall Street. Company executives said they are benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products soaring. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world and its business is booming.\n\nWith its share price up 13% in the last month alone, MU stock looks to have plenty of momentum, which should continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highs And Lows: Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) Vs The Rest Of The Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let’s have a look at Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 8 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.3%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 5% below consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and processors and graphics chips stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 2.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM)\n\nThe result of a spinoff from Sanken in Japan, Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) is a designer of power management chips and distance sensors used in electric vehicles and data centers.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems reported revenues of $240.6 million, down 10.7% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 2.4%. It was a weaker quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\n“Continued strong momentum in e-Mobility drove record fiscal year 2024 sales to more than $1 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.35. We also achieved a record level of design wins of more than $1 billion. I would like to thank the entire Allegro team for their contributions which enabled us to achieve these significant milestones,” said Vineet Nargolwala, President and CEO of Allegro. Allegro MicroSystems Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 5.7% since the results and currently trades at $31.05.\n\nRead our full report on Allegro MicroSystems here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion, up 262% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 5.9%. It was an exceptional quarter for the company. Its revenue and EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in its data center and automotive segments; the result in its automotive segment (17% year-on-year revenue growth) was especially impressive given the industry is in a cyclical downturn and many other semiconductor companies have posted year-on-year declines for that end market.\n\nStory continues Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 15.2% since the results and currently trades at $1,092.6.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q1: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $140.8 million, down 23.6% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 0.2% since the results and currently trades at $76.75.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor's results here.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $941 million, up 48.7% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 1.6%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and its inventory levels increased.\n\nThe stock is down 12% since the results and currently trades at $98.44.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qorvo here, it's free.\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $9.39 billion, up 1.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a decent quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts' EPS estimates but an increase in its inventory levels.\n\nThe stock is up 31% since the results and currently trades at $215.07.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qualcomm here, it's free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "3 Sorry Nasdaq Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite‘s rally has yet to abate, but there are still Nasdaq stocks to sell. The tech-heavy index has risen over 11% and is likely to edge upwards. Fueling the rally are two dynamics. On the one hand, the core consumer personal expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased only 0.3% on a month-to-month basis, a stark difference from the 0.5% month-over-month increase we witnessed in January. Recent macroeconomic data suggests inflation is cooling.\n\nOn the other hand, demand for artificial intelligence products and technologies remains at a fever high. AI-chip behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported Q1 financial figures last Thursday and beat Wall Street’s revenue and earnings handedly, indicating the AI craze isn’t just hype. The Nasdaq has broadly benefitted from Nvidia’s consistent earnings beats over the past year, and this time wasn’t different from any others.\n\nOf course, not every Nasdaq-listed stock has enjoyed the rally. Like in every index, there are winners and losers. Not every Nasdaq-listed company is linked to AI. Some are operating in sectors that are facing severe headwinds due to high interest rates as well as general macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three Nasdaq stocks to sell this month before they ruin your returns.\n\nThoughtworks (TWKS) The ThoughtWorks (TWKS) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDigital transformation is an important theme amongst technology businesses these days. Enterprises covering almost every sector of the economy have worked to increase operational efficiencies through onboarding various technological solutions. To help them plan and execute on this pivotal business changes, many companies will approach a technology consultancy services business like Thoughtworks (NASDAQ:TWKS). Thoughtworks helps businesses to develop and implement modernization strategies. For example, the tech consultancy company helped Australian software giant Atlassian (NYSE:TEAM) to migrate its application-building tool, Bitbucket, to the public cloud.\n\nUnfortunately, the uncertain macroeconomic environment has bitten into Thoughtworks’ sales growth since the pandemic years ushered in an era of high interest rates. Uncertainty has caused some of Thoughtworks current clients and prospective ones to delay projects. Moreover, despite a clear earnings-beat for Q1 2024, investors are still feeling sour about the ability for technology services company to improve revenue growth rates. TWKS shares have plummeted more than 29% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nLumentum (LITE) A corporate office for the technology company Lumentum during the daytime.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLumentum (NASDAQ:LITE) is a communications equipment provider that specializes in optical and photonic products. The former is crucial for creating high-capacity, low-latency fiber optics cables, while the latter consists of industrial lasers that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) leverage in their manufacturing processes.\n\nTelecom and data center providers, driven by the rise of cloud computing, have increased their demand for optical products. Photonics devices, which include LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors that go into modern automotives, have also been in high demand. As a result, companies like Lumentum should be seeing a steady rise in sales over time. However, the communications equipment provider reported a year-over-year decrease in revenue in its Q3 2024 earnings report as telecom customers pulled back spending as they continue to digest already elevated inventory levels. It’s remains unclear when that particular segment of Lumentum’s customer set will recover.\n\nIn the meantime, LITE shares have fallen nearly 12% on a YTD basis, making it a prime candidate of Nasdaq stocks to sell.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock. Nasdaq Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is probably best known for its iconic pharmacy and retail outlets that are located across the United States. The Covid-19 global pandemic sent the company into a whirlwind. Lockdowns during the onset of the pandemic meant many customers who would have shopped in store for products had to source them online. Walgreens did, however, benefit from the countrywide Covid-19 vaccination campaign. If we double-click into Walgreens’ reported sales growth for fiscal year 2021, there was sizable jump to 8.6% largely off of the back of vaccinations. With the brunt of the pandemic now behind us, those tailwinds have largely dissipated.\n\nThe company’s earnings history after the pandemic years has also been hit or miss. Most recently, despite exceeding Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and earnings, Walgreens decided to slash its quarterly dividend nearly in half, from $0.48/share to $0.25/share, ultimately causing the chain drug store’s stock to plunge.\n\nWBA has fallen more than 37% YTD, making it amongst some of the Nasdaq’s underperformers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Post-Earnings Picks: 3 Cheap Stocks Worth Picking Up on Clearance",
        "content": "AI accelerator kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) pretty much ended big tech’s earnings season with a thunderous bang. Even in the face of elevated estimates, Jensen Huang’s GPU firm continued to impress the crowd. When it comes to the AI run, it still seems to be full speed ahead. If I had to guess, Nvidia has a couple more positive surprises up its sleeves for future quarters as it finds more ways to fly. As Nvidia leads the charge in the AI revolution, there are cheap stocks cashing in on the craze which you can buy to make a clean profit.\n\nIndeed, not every company has been able to pull off a rally-inducing quarter this earnings season. Some companies have fallen flat and could be at risk of further depreciation into year’s end. Though catching falling knives post-earnings can be a dangerous game, I do think the following names make sense to monitor while they’re oversold.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps shareholders in such firms had lost their patience and jumped ship to Nvidia after its latest blowout. After all, why settle for an ailing performer when you could punch your ticket to a frontrunner in the fourth industrial revolution? In any case, the following trio is worth consideration if you seek great discounts in firms that are still worth owning through their temporary fumbles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop Cheap Stocks: Intuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is the financial software developer behind popular offerings such as QuickBooks and TurboTax. The company has been actively investing in generative AI initiatives to enhance its offering and remove some of the clouds from the rather hazy world of small business and personal finances. Indeed, dealing with one’s finances can be rather complex—a problem that Intuit can better solve with an assist from generative AI.\n\nAs Intuit doubles down on AI, there’s a glorious opportunity to improve the industry. Of course, by changing the industry landscape via AI-powered time savers, the firm will also be able to attract more cash from its loyal customer base.\n\nFor now, I don’t think much of the AI narrative is priced in here. Not after INTU stock plummeted more than 8% last Friday after issuing underwhelming guidance after it clocked in some solid quarterly results that got a jolt from tax season.\n\nInvestors with a longer-term mindset may find value in shares here while they’re off 9% from their 52-week highs and going for 32.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). If you’re looking for cheap stocks, start here.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is another long-term AI beneficiary that investors seem to be cashing out of lately. Last Friday, shares of the enterprise management software company nosedived over 15% following a second quarter that saw softer full-year guidance and some subscription revenues that fell just shy of analyst expectations. Indeed, the WDAY stock plunge was bad enough that even some of its enterprise cloud peers, like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), fell in sympathy on the day.\n\nUndoubtedly, WDAY stock has been under pressure since shares peaked in February 2024. Now down over 28% from its all-time high, I view Workday as a compelling relative bargain at around $220 per share, especially if you’re a fan of its longer-term AI-driven growth narrative. The firm has an opportunity to bolster growth as it integrates AI technologies across its existing applications, specifically in areas such as human resources (HR).\n\nAt 32.9 times forward P/E, I view Workday as getting a tad too cheap given its promising AI-driven future. This is one of the top cheap stocks.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) suffered a setback when it reported earnings just over a week ago. Sales came in short of expectations while comparable sales slipped 2.8%, thanks in part to industry-specific headwinds.\n\nAs inflation cools further and homeowners have more opportunity to save up for ambitious home remodeling projects, HD stock could easily bounce back. Additionally, many consumers may find it an opportunistic time to pursue home improvement projects as various construction materials (think lumber) fall further in price. Falling prices on various goods and an upward turn in housing turnover could certainly give Home Depot a shot in the arm.\n\nIn any case, Home Depot is one of those incredibly well-run companies that one should hang onto through good times and bad. It’s a wonderful company that happens to be moving through a wobbly industry climate. In due time, things could turn on a dime, perhaps at the first signs of any shifts in consumer spending habits. Until then, investors may wish to back up the truck while the dividend yield is at a bountiful 2.77%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Salesforce.

        "content": "The American stock market is on fire. The S&P 500 index, a benchmark for U.S. equities, has been printing fresh all-time highs this year and trading at a staggering 70% above its historical average when measured by the 10-year cyclically adjusted P/E ratio, known to many as the Shiller P/E Ratio.\n\nThe question on many investors' minds is whether this is the time to pull back on stock investments, particularly those tracking this benchmark index like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nTo answer this question, we must consider past lessons within the context of the unprecedented era humanity is entering.\n\nWhat the past can teach us\n\nHistorically, buying into the S&P 500 at all-time highs has been smart. Valuation metrics like the Shiller P/E ratio lack predictive power for stock or index movements in the short term, typically less than a year.\n\nInstead, market momentum has been a more reliable indicator over periods shorter than a decade, with indices often gaining an additional 12.7% in the 12 months following the achievement of all-time highs.\n\nThis phenomenon is driven by \"recency bias,\" where investors prioritize recent market performance over long-term fundamentals, potentially leading to overvaluation and subsequent market corrections.\n\nSo despite the S&P 500's current Shiller P/E Ratio of 34.7, significantly higher than the modern-era average of 20.3, it may not be time to shift to risk-free assets like bonds or high-yield money market accounts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAfter all, the market's forward momentum indicates that further gains are on the horizon. That said, S&P 500 bull markets that result in stretched valuation metrics typically lead to multiyear bear markets, characterized by the outperformance of risk-free assets relative to stocks.\n\nHistory, in turn, suggests that the pro move is to keep buying core funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF for two to three more quarters while keeping an eye on the underperforming bond market. A deeper analysis suggests the stocks may be poised to break with this trend line, paving the way for an extended bull run in the S&P 500 over the next several years.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nWe are witnessing a unique phase in financial history. Technological innovations could render past trends irrelevant and upend conventional thinking.\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, and the automation of labor-intensive jobs will revolutionize society within the next five years.\n\nFor example, the ongoing displacement of jobs by AI, with Goldman Sachs predicting that 300 million full-time jobs may be replaced, underscores the magnitude of this transformation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis rapid technological evolution necessitates a reevaluation of traditional concepts such as the value of a four-year college degree and the future of industries like car insurance and entry-level employment.\n\nAll these pressing issues will have a significant impact on stock market valuations in the coming years. So, as we navigate this era of AI, our approach to investment valuation may also need to adapt.\n\nThe stock market seems to be anticipating these changes, with chipmakers like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) at the forefront of this shift. After all, Nvidia's stock, which lies at the heart of the AI revolution, has done this in the past five years: NVDA Chart\n\nIn short, these technological advancements are already reshaping the U.S. stock market.\n\nWhat it means to investors\n\nInvesting in the era of AI presents both enormous challenges and life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhile historical trends can provide valuable insights, the unique circumstances of the current market and the transformative impact of emerging technologies require a fresh perspective on investment strategies.\n\nThe American stock market's current performance may be a harbinger of a new era in investing. Traditional valuation metrics may have to be supplemented by a deeper understanding of technological advancements and societal changes.\n\nThis emerging theme, in turn, should power U.S. large-cap stocks higher for an extended period. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF thus screens as a top buy, despite its premium valuation and tendency to revert to the mean when its valuation breaks historical precedent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Sorry Dow Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can",
        "content": "If you had a position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after it reported earnings on May 22, you had a great week. If you owned some members of the Dow 30, your week may have looked much different. The stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined sharply last week. Some of these stocks may present a buying opportunity. In other cases, these are Dow stocks to sell.\n\nDow stocks have large market capitalizations that put them in the category of blue-chip stocks. Many investors carry one or more of these stocks in their portfolio because they outperform the market during bear markets. And, even though they lag behind growth stocks in bull markets, investors will generally get income from a stable, growing dividend.\n\nThat means that many of these falling Dow stocks will be solid buy-the-dip candidates. But that’s not the case for all of them. Here are three Dow stocks to sell based on the headwinds listed below.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nIt’s almost too easy to put Boeing (NYSE:BA) on a list of Dow stocks to sell. But too easy doesn’t mean it’s unfair.\n\nIt seems that the company is facing new (and bad) news nearly every week. Boeing has already announced that it will have a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) next year. But, that’s failing to stop the drop in BA stock which is down near a 52-week low.\n\nThe company has requested $60 billion in federal assistance. It seems unlikely that the federal government will try to force a company as important to our aerospace and defense industry as Boeing into bankruptcy. However, an analyst for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) suggests that some form of a modified bailout could be in order. Not surprisingly, the same analyst has a $135 price target on BA stock which would drop the stock near five-year lows.\n\nThat’s an outlier from other analysts who have a consensus upside of 20% for Boeing. However, the company now says second quarter orders won’t show strong growth. Further, the company will have a net cash burn in 2024, making BA stock one to avoid.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) stock is down 15.4% in 2024 and is trading near its 52-week low. Based purely on technical analysis, the stock does look to be at a solid level of support around $91.\n\nHowever, Nike is on this list of Dow stocks to sell because of slowing growth. It appears that inflation and higher interest rates are weighing on consumers, particularly in a hyper-competitive market like athleisure and footwear.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe two specific issues that Nike is working hard to address are innovation and the speed at which they bring those innovation to market. The company expects the Olympic games in Paris to be a significant catalyst this summer.\n\nThat’s likely the reason that analysts have a consensus buy rating on NKE stock with a price target that forecasts 20% upside. However, before you think of buying that dip, consider that Nike is guiding to low single-digit growth for the first half of its 2025 fiscal year which begins in June 2024.\n\nWhen you put it all together, NKE stock may be worth taking a look at later this year, particularly if interest rates tick lower. But, it’s hard to see the company’s fourth quarter earnings showing significant acceleration in growth. And the dividend isn’t large enough to attract new investors.\n\nTravelers Companies (TRV) Red umbrella covering stacks of bills\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUnlike the other two stocks on this list, Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) is having a solid year. TRV stock is up 23.8% in the last 12 months and 11.9% in 2024.\n\nHowever, expectations of past history will be an accurate reflection of future results. In this case, companies that have to increase their insurance rates generally make attractive stock targets.\n\nThe problem is that Travelers Companies is already facing higher claims from strong summer storms that have moved throughout the country. In its last earnings report, it reported that catastrophe-related expenses were up 33% to $712 million.\n\nAnd that’s before the hurricane season kicks off at the beginning of June. It’s expected to be one of the most active seasons on record. That means more claims and losses are to be expected. Investors should look at TRV’s most recent performance, which is down 3% in the last three months. And, that would be a better barometer of the likely performance in the second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Brilliant Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before Its Stock Split",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) last split its stock in 2021, a 4-for-1 split to reduce its $600 share price to around $150. Now, due to the company's success in the past few years, management has decided it needs another one.\n\nDuring its last earnings release, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will occur on June 10, reducing its $1,000 stock price to $100 per share.\n\nMany people (including myself) saw this split coming. It will affect some investors who don't have access to fractional shares. In the past, stock-split announcements caused massive run-ups in the weeks leading up to the split. Last time, Nvidia increased by 20% between the split announcement and the effective date.\n\nIf you're looking to buy Nvidia stock before the split, I have three good reasons why it's a good idea.\n\n1. Data center revenue growth isn't slowing down\n\nNvidia's primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs), which handle intense computing workloads. Because GPUs process many calculations in parallel, they are great choices for complex tasks like training artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nAI demand has been unprecedented over the past year, driving the stock to new heights. Nvidia recognizes revenue from GPUs used in AI in its data center division, which grew revenue by an astounding 427% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28).\n\nWhile that's impressive, investors really wanted to see the quarter-over-quarter growth rate -- whether AI demand is growing or shrinking from one quarter to the next. And with revenue rising 23% from the fourth quarter's figure, it's clear that the demand for AI computing power is still growing.\n\nNvidia doesn't give segment-specific guidance, but second-quarter revenue is expected to be about $28 billion, indicating 107% year-over-year growth and an 8% quarter-over-quarter increase. This appears to be a slowdown, but Nvidia is starting to come up against more difficult comparisons. However, it consistently beat its guidance -- the first-quarter goal was $24 billion while the actual figure was $26 billion.\n\nNvidia's business isn't slowing down. And it likely won't. According to CEO Jensen Huang, \"The next industrial revolution has begun -- companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center -- AI factories -- to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\n\n2. The stock isn't as expensive as you might think\n\nPart of the reason many have avoided buying the stock despite its success is its valuation. Before announcing first-quarter results, Nvidia traded at 35 times forward earnings. That's cheaper than Microsoft, which trades at 36 times forward earnings, yet Nvidia is growing more rapidly.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhen a company is transforming an industry like Nvidia is, it's hard to value a stock because of so many unknowns. With the transformation that AI is bringing and the massive amount of infrastructure needed to execute that change, Nvidia will continue to succeed, and the stock's valuation is a less important factor.\n\n3. Nvidia's dividend is growing\n\nAnother announcement Nvidia buried in its earnings release was a 150% dividend increase. Before the bump, it paid shareholders $0.04 per share in a quarterly dividend, equating to a 0.016% yield. That essentially made the dividend a nonfactor in owning the stock.\n\nWith the increase and the stock split, Nvidia will now pay investors a $0.01 per share quarterly dividend, for a 0.04% yield. That's still not anything impressive, but it's the foundation for a much larger payment.\n\nMany investments are being made to produce the most powerful GPU possible right now. Eventually, this demand will decrease, and Nvidia can increase its dividend to a meaningful amount when it diverts its cash flows to return capital to shareholders.\n\nFor now, management sees more value in reinvesting its cash flows into the business rather than paying dividends. And so far, it has been right.\n\nNone of those reasons has anything to do with the stock split itself, but that's on purpose. Stock splits are mostly cosmetic actions and only have consequences if investors cannot access fractional shares or trade options.\n\nThere are far better reasons to buy Nvidia stock than a split announcement. If you buy now and the stock sees a huge rise due to the announcement, you'll benefit in the short term. But the three reasons I discussed above will be more impactful over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In the ever-changing market, savvy investors look for bright prospects to profit from the game-changing potential of technology stocks. Here are three major players. The first one sticks out for its unwavering dedication to operational effectiveness and cost control. The firm has experienced a significant increase in sales, but its cost control measures demonstrate a robust operating model that generates strong margins and solid market value.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one, renowned for its revolutionary developments in electric cars, has now expanded its horizons to the energy industry. With its energy business witnessing record profitability and its energy storage deployments projected to rise astounding through 2024, the firm has firmly established itself as a major player in the renewable energy solutions market, instilling confidence in its growth potential.\n\nFinally, the third one deftly negotiates the semiconductor market, using operational excellence and regional expansion as engines of success. Its robust presence in developing nations like China and Korea attests to the company’s skill at establishing a foothold in strategic areas and leveraging the need for semiconductor solutions throughout the world.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) maintains great cost control and operating edge alongside revenue growth and investments in infrastructure and AI. The company uses resources wisely, striking a balance between tight cost management techniques and investments in emerging fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and Reality Labs. For instance, Q1 2024 total costs and expenses came to $22.64 billion, a slight year-over-year rise of 6%. This shows effective revenue growth cost control, producing operating solid margins.\n\nAdditionally, Meta is positioned for long-term development and innovation because it prioritizes infrastructure, immersive technologies, and sophisticated AI models to support future product development and preserve competitiveness. With expected increases to support the AI roadmap and Reality Labs efforts, capex for Q1 was $6.72 billion.\n\nLastly, despite large expenditures, the business produces a sizable amount of free cash flow and has enough liquidity to fund expansion plans and satisfy shareholders. With $12.53 billion in free cash flow for Q1, Meta executed repurchases of $14.64 billion of its Class A common shares and delivered $1.27 billion in dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Megapack, one of Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) energy storage deployments, hit a high mark in Q1, resulting in record profitability for the energy segment. Looking forward, Tesla projects that the deployment of energy storage will increase by at least 75% in 2024 compared to 2023. Further, record-high installations and margins indicate Tesla’s energy sector’s robust growth and profitability. Thus, such expansion in the energy industry broadens Tesla’s sources of income and boosts the company’s overall profitability considerably.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla is continuously growing its core AI infrastructure, and in Q1, it doubled its AI training compute sequentially. Approximately 35,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 chips have been installed and engaged into service by the company for training purposes. By 2024, Tesla hopes to have 85,000 installed. Tesla is making considerable and fast-growing investments in AI infrastructure and autonomous driving tech.\n\nOverall, Tesla’s focus on improving its autonomous driving capabilities is reflected in deploying sophisticated AI training computing resources. Therefore, this tech advantage solidifies future advancements in autonomous vehicle technology by boosting the functionality of current offerings like full self-driving (FSD).\n\nLam Research (LRCX) Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX Stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe revenue distribution of Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) throughout various areas demonstrates the company’s accomplishments in regional expansion and market penetration. Lam Research has a significant presence in one of the fastest-growing semiconductor markets, with 42% of sales coming from the China area in Q3 2024. Indeed, multinational expenditure in China has increased, which is another proof of Lam Research’s success in this market.\n\nMoreover, Korea is a noteworthy market for Lam Research, accounting for 24% of its sales. The company’s excellent market penetration and client base growth in Korea reflect the increase in revenue share in this area. Japan and Taiwan are significant markets for Lam Research, even if they are less significant than China and Korea. Hence, these markets support the company’s worldwide revenue-diversification strategy.\n\nFinally, Lam Research’s potential for rapid expansion is further supported by its performance lead and operational edge.

        "title": "Sky-High Sell-Off: 3 Overvalued Stocks to Drop From Your Portfolio ASAP",
        "content": "Despite positive sentiment following Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, investors are looking for overvalued stocks to sell as signs of excess optimism start to show.\n\nThe latest U.S. Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys came in hotter than expected, showing that both manufacturing and services inflation remained high. This spooked investors and sent stocks tumbling. Given the persistent inflation pressures in the PMI data, traders are rethinking the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the coming months.\n\nSavvy investors have seen the warning signs: the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits above historical averages, retail investors pour money into risky assets like meme stocks and equity valuations remain lofty. While one might argue optimism can persist, valuations do have limits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo identify which overvalued stocks to sell as a correction unravels, investors analyze whether fundamentals like the P/E ratio, earnings-per-share (EPS) and profitability justify valuation metrics.\n\nAs such, we have identified three sky-high stocks you should consider dropping from your portfolio as soon as possible based on stretched valuations, deteriorating fundamentals, or technical indications screaming sell.\n\nMacy’s (M) Macy's (M) logo on storefront in city with white sky behind\n\nSource: Joe Tabacca / Shutterstock.com\n\nMacy’s (NYSE:M) is a major retail player that owns and manages department stores. The company faces declining sales and weak consumer spending. Macy’s stock trades at an extreme premium to its peers and has barely made any profits. Its P/E ratio of 668x is 37 times the industry median of 18.45x, while diluted EPS declined 61% from 56 cents to to 22 cents as net income fell by 60%.\n\nThe company reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings results on Wednesday, May 22. However, the results beat meager expectations as Macy’s continues its turnaround efforts amid stagnant U.S. retail sales. While management is attempting to right the ship, investing in 50 pilot stores as part of the turnaround strategy has resulted in just a 0.3% increase in sales from these stores.\n\nDespite the weak balance sheet, Macy’s shares rose about 3% following its announcement to raise full-year guidance to between $22.3 billion and $22.9 billion from $22.2 billion to $22.9 billion. Moreover, Macy’s stock price has soared over 80% since it bottomed out last November. The recent increase has brought its 14-day relative strength index (RSI) to 58. This is almost 10% above the industry average of 49, positioning Macy’s at an alarming distance from its 52-week average of $22.10.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe inflated valuation metrics and Macy’s bleak growth prospects make this one of the overvalued stocks to sell at current levels. Next quarter growth estimates see an 85% decline compared to the S&P 500’s 11% gain. It might be too late to sell then.\n\nVizio Holding (VZIO) A remote being held and pointed at a black flatscreen tv with two potted plants on either side\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Gaurav Paswan\n\nVizio Holding (NYSE:VZIO), a smart TV maker that went public in 2021, has seen its stock price climb over 50% since February. This came after Walmart (NYSE:WMT) agreed to acquire the company for $2.3 billion to accelerate its advertising business, Walmart Connect. However, Vizio disclosed that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had requested additional information from both companies, implying an in-depth antitrust review of the deal. This can potentially delay the deal for months or years or even block it.\n\nSeveral indicators suggest Vizio’s share price has outpaced its fundamentals while uncertainty around the deal remains. Vizio’s P/E ratio currently stands at 132x, surpassing the S&P 500’s 27x by about five times. This is the case despite revenue growth declining for seven straight quarters. The company also reported an EPS loss of six cents in early May. Yet, it still trades shy of its 52-week high of $11.28, below the $11.50 Walmart promised.\n\nWhile Vizio’s Platform+ business grew strongly year-over-year (YOY), weaker-than-expected TV unit sales and pricing led to an overall revenue miss and losses for the quarter. With inflation stubbornly higher, consumers may pull back discretionary spending on high-ticket items like smart TVs even more as the summer holidays approach.\n\nAnalysts expect Vizio’s growth to continue slowing over the next quarter, dropping 43%. At its current valuation, Vizio likely needs to post annual growth of at least 15-20% to justify its stock price.\n\nFor investors who have enjoyed hefty gains in Vizio stock over the past year, this is now considered one of the overvalued stocks to sell and take profits on time.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Carvana (CVNA) automobile dealership vending machine. Carvana is an online-only used car dealer.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA), the alternative company to dealerships that sells used cars online, has seen its stock price skyrocket over 850% in the past year. However, it lacks profitability, and due to reporting an EPS loss of 41 cents, its P/E is absent. Carvana’s high debt levels and lack of consistent profitability indicate that it is more of a “meme stock”. Notably, almost 28% of its shares are shorted.\n\nSeveral signs point to Carvana being highly overvalued as it trades at $110 per share, 10% above analysts’ estimates. Carvana’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio currently stands at 1.56x, which is twice the industry average of 0.82x and well above its historical average. At the same time, the company’s rising debt and interest expenses continue to eat into the company’s operating profits while revenues remain below costs. Without a clear path to profitability, it will be difficult for Carvana to sustain its current valuation for much longer.\n\nDespite its innovative e-commerce model, the company narrowly avoided bankruptcy last year by restructuring its debt. It still faces increasing competition from traditional dealers and new entrants in the used car market.\n\nAlthough it beat revenue estimates in its early May Q1 earnings report, investors should consider adding CVNA stock to the list of overvalued stocks to sell. This is especially true as auto loan default is at its highest in 13 years due to borrowers falling behind on high-interest payments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Sorry Metaverse Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can",
        "content": "The metaverse is still a work in progress. After Facebook decided to change its company name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) back in 2021, many investors thought the metaverse would be the next big thing for entertainment and online interactions. While there is definitely some evidence of that, much of the equities gains in metaverse-related stocks have been concentrated with the large tech companies. The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), for example, has risen 8.6% year-to-date (YTD), but the gains have come from names like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta.\n\nBelow are three metaverse stocks to sell now before it’s too late.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) provides the software and platform for creators to build 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets and personal computers. In particular, Unity offers Create Solutions, a set of tools and services used to build, ship and run real-time 2D and 3D content as well as its Grow Solutions product, which provides creators with a way to grow and engage their user base while monetizing their content. Unity Software has been under scrutiny from both users and investors. The software firm announced a restructuring plan in January that would see the company cutting 25% of its workforce. While this pleased investors, Unity Software still issued weak guidance for Q1’2024 just a month later.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWeak guidance coupled with an ongoing restructuring plan has made investors skittish on U shares. The stock has collapsed 51% since the start of the year.\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) may be an unfamiliar name to readers, but the holding company’s dating products are probably not. Tinder, Hinge and Match compose Match Group’s extensive list of wholly-owned dating apps. While not a staple name in the metaverse sector, the company has been looking into integrating virtual experiences and augmented reality (AR) into its platforms. For instance, Tinder has experimented with features that incorporate AR and virtual environments, such as Swipe Night. an interactive video series where users make choices that affect the storyline and who they match with.\n\nUnfortunately, the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty has negatively affected Match Group’s financial performance. Despite beating Wall Street estimates in their Q1’2024 earnings report, Match Group reported a 9% decline in its paying user base, bringing the total figure below 10 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nContinued weak consumer discretionary spending will hamper Match Group’s near and medium-term growth prospects. Shares have dipped almost 20% YTD.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen discussing online or virtual entertainment, it is hard to not discuss gaming giant Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). The platform’s Roblox Studio product empowers ordinary users to build and publish their own 3D content and experiences. Roblox Client is where users can game and explore various kinds of 3D gaming content.\n\nAlthough Roblox is clearly a growing platform with millions of users, the platform has struggled with profitability in recent years. Roblox’s Q1’2024 earnings print figures saw the company missed Wall Street’s estimates for revenue and booking. Also, the company’s net loss did not improve on a year-over-year basis. Weak bookings guidance for Q2 highlighted the growth headwinds facing the platform.\n\nRBLX shares are down nearly 27% on a YTD basis.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Why These 3 Quantum Computing Stocks Are Worth the Risk",
        "content": "Quantum computing may be the next big thing, and lots of people are talking about it. The potential to revolutionize industries from pharmaceuticals to finance has investors keeping a close eye on key players in this space.\n\nBut which companies are leading the charge?\n\nTo answer this critical question, a trio of Fool.com contributors with decades of high-tech analysis experience put their heads together and came up with three promising quantum computing stocks. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), IonQ(NYSE: IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum(NYSE: QBTS) offer very different approaches to the quantum market, but all three could make you a lot of money over the long haul.\n\nSo grab a coffee, sit back, and find out why these quantum computing stocks could be your next big investment.\n\nQuantum computers need help, and help is already here\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Nvidia): I recently wrote a couple of articles about quantum computing and some breakthroughs happening in the nascent industry -- although \"industry\" is a bit generous. Quantum computing is more of a research and development initiative, not a full-blown industry.\n\nNevertheless, companies like Microsoft and start-up Quantinuum (majority-owned by Honeywell) have achieved incremental gains in quantum compute usefulness by pairing their quantum computers with classical computers. Why?\n\nFor one thing, the quantum mechanical measurements (\"spooky\" effects at the atomic level and smaller) are highly sensitive and prone to error. A tried-and-true classical computer can help correct those errors.\n\nThus, there may be no better classical computer right now than Nvidia's accelerated compute platform, powered by its GPUs and full stack of software libraries and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. In early spring 2023, Nvidia said it released a quantum computer control unit powered by its chips. And more recently, the company said multiple research supercomputers around the world have expanded their capabilities using Nvidia's CUDA-Q platform of GPUs and hybrid classical-quantum software algorithms.\n\nAnd of course, Nvidia's latest Blackwell platform represents another exponential speed up in classical computing power. Researchers are already lining up for Blackwell to fuel their development of quantum, a potential \"next big thing\" at some point in the future.\n\nTo be clear, Nvidia's wild growth in the last year isn't because of quantum computing. This is but one of many applications developers are hard at work on, thanks to Nvidia GPUs. However, when trying to figure out a best place to invest today in the nascent quantum R&D initiative, Nvidia may be the simplest stock for most investors looking toward the future of the computing sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether quantum computers become a mainstream reality or not may actually largely depend on the pioneer of computing power today. I'm happy to keep holding my Nvidia shares, for quantum development and a lot of other tech breakthroughs too.\n\nThe most pragmatic route to a quantum future\n\nBilly Duberstein(IonQ): Quantum computing may seem like a speculative pie-in-the-sky bet. But quantum leader IonQ is actually making highly practical, tangible progress toward deploying quantum computing in real-world settings.\n\nThis has come down to the company's deliberate choices, such as deciding to use the mature technology of trapped ion qubits as the backbone of its current systems. While synthetically made qubits or alternatives may ultimately be faster or superior far down the road, these other technologies require temperatures near absolute zero to deploy, and have challenges that may not be overcome for years. On the other hand, atomic qubits can be deployed at room temperature and can run for longer periods of time.\n\nThe choice allows IonQ to sell systems to customers such as the U.S. Air Force Research Lab and QuantumBasel in Europe. Thus, the company generates revenue, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss last quarter of $20.7 million seems manageable, given the company's cash pile of over $434 million.\n\nMoreover, the company appears to be executing at a high level for the state of the business. Last quarter, even though the company only generated $7.6 million in revenue, IonQ beat its own revenue guidance, as it was able to recognize more revenue from a contract that was based on the completion of project milestones. And the company boosted its 2024 bookings guidance to a range of $75 million to $95 million, up from guidance of $70 million to $90 million one quarter ago.\n\nThis comes on the back of several technical achievements made earlier this year. These include reaching a working #AQ 35 system a year earlier than forecast in January, as well as achieving \"ion-photon entanglements\" in February, a technological achievement that will allow quantum systems to communicate with each other and scale quantum networks.\n\nAnd the company also continues to attract top talent. In March, quantum algorithm expert Martin Roetteler joined IonQ from Microsoft and will head the company's efforts to develop real-world applications to run on IonQ's quantum computers. On the recent conference call with analysts, management noted its teams are making \"serious headway\" in advancing real-world quantum software applications.\n\nI think IonQ's pragmatic and iterative approach is a good one, so that if quantum technology does manage to take off in the years ahead, it will likely be leading the pack.\n\nA speculative bet on D-Wave Quantum\n\nAnders Bylund (D-Wave): I'm going way out on a limb here: D-Wave Quantum is about as risky as you can get in the quantum computing industry. It's a bona fide penny stock and barely large enough to talk about, with a market cap of just $200 million. The company is deeply unprofitable and its revenues skimpy, to the tune of merely $9.6 million over the last year.\n\nSo let's get real -- D-Wave is not a classic value investment and too hot to touch for most growth investors, too. It's a speculative bet on the far future of quantum computing, and many things can go wrong along the way. Please keep your D-Wave investment small for now. If the company runs out of cash and goes out of business, make sure it doesn't hurt you.\n\nBut I'm talking about an established leader in the quantum computing sector here. It has produced actual systems with thousands of qubits. Its quantum software and consulting services are available on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. And above all else, D-Wave holds hundreds of quantum computing patents and citations, second only to IBM in both cases.\n\nD-Wave seems to be leaning away from the costly systems-building business for the moment. Instead, the company is focusing on monetizing its treasure trove of technology patents.\n\nSo maybe IonQ, IBM, or Nvidia will rule the world in terms of quantum computing hardware sales. Perhaps I haven't even heard of the sector's biggest long-term winner yet. But D-Wave looks poised to ride the coattails of whoever the final king might be, providing patent licenses and consulting services to unlock the full power of next-generation computers. These services should be in high demand in a few years.\n\nAnd starting from this barely-there stock market footprint, D-Wave could be worth the risk. A small investment in this intriguing and incredibly low-priced stock may pay off handsomely as the quantum industry evolves.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "At this point, directly betting against semiconductor stocks – especially if they’re named Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) – should first come with a warning. The sector continues to defy gravity, with demand seemingly pointing to a limitless ceiling.\n\nNevertheless, one must figure that even mighty Nvidia will reach a saturation level where the upside returns can no longer justify the downside risks. However, we know that technology continues to march perpetually forward, which puts investors in a quandary. Still, I should bring up the obvious point: there are other semiconductor stocks besides NVDA that you can buy.\n\nNo, they’re not going to be as sexy as the graphics processor specialist. However, the expectations aren’t as sky high, potentially translating to a less-acute risk-reward profile. Moreover, they can ride the coattails of NVDA. With that in mind, below are semiconductor stocks that are away from the spotlight.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKLA Corp (KLAC) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBased in Milpitas, California, KLA Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC) falls under the semiconductor equipment and materials category. Per its public profile, the enterprise designs, manufacturers and markets process control, process enabling and yield-management solutions for the chipmaking and electronics industries worldwide. It provides multiple “background” services, such as identifying and analyzing defects on wafers.\n\nFinancially, KLA is not a showman type of investment. However, it offers consistency. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company’s average earnings surprise landed at 6.7%. In the trailing 12 months (TTM), KLA posted net income of $2.61 billion on sales of $9.6 billion. Presently, its quarterly revenue growth (year-over-year) comes out to a loss of 3%.\n\nTo be sure, fiscal 2024 may be a disappointment, with experts anticipating earnings per share of $23.28 on sales of $9.78 billion. That comes out to a loss of 8.2% in the bottom line and 6.8% in the top line. However, fiscal 2025 could see EPS rise to $28.40 on revenue of $11.13 billion. Thus, it’s one of the non-NVDA semiconductor stocks to consider.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) engages in the provision of manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display interface and related industries. It offers various equipment and services to help fabricate computer chips or integrated circuits. It also provides specialized technologies to improve performance and productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, Applied Materials offers a similar level of consistency like KLA Corp, but at a higher threshold. In the past four quarters since fiscal Q1 2024, the company posted an average earnings surprise of 8.13%. During the TTM, Applied posted net income of $7.3 billion on sales of $26.5 billion. Currently, its quarterly sales growth rate sits at only 0.2%.\n\nFiscal 2024 might not be the greatest cycle for AMAT. Analysts anticipate a 3.85% decline in EPS to $7.74 and a 6.2% drop in the top line to $24.89 billion. That said, the high-side target calls for EPS of $7.98 on revenue of $25.2 billion.\n\nMoreover, in fiscal 2025, experts believe EPS could soar to $8.95 with a top line of $27.71 billion. Thus, it’s one of the semiconductor stocks to keep on your radar.\n\nEntegris (ENTG) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.

Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHailing from Billerica, Massachusetts, Entegris (NASDAQ:ENTG) develops, manufactures, and supplies microcontamination control products. It also offers specialty chemicals and advanced materials handling solutions in North America, Taiwan, China and other international markets. While Entegris might not be in the sexiest role in the semiconductor ecosystem, it undoubtedly plays a critical stagehand role.\n\nAs with the other semiconductor stocks mentioned earlier, Entegris offers financial consistency. In the past four quarters since Q1, the company’s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 12.73%. That’s quite impressive. During the TTM period, the enterprise posted net income of $314.1 million on sales of $3.37 billion. However, its quarterly revenue growth rate sits at 16.4% below parity.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate a split offering, so to speak. EPS could rise to $3.29, implying 24.6% YOY growth. On the other hand, the top line could erode almost 5% to $3.35 billion. However, fiscal 2025 could see EPS soar to $4.43 on sales of $3.82 billion. Moreover, the blue-sky revenue target could hit $4.03 billion. For speculators, it’s one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Recommends This Index Fund. It Could Turn $350 Per Month Into $903,800, With Help From AI Stocks.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through a litany of shrewd investments. In fact, its stock price has skyrocketed more than 4,300,000% since he took control in 1965. That accomplishment has made Buffett one of the most revered figures in the financial world.\n\nSurprisingly, Buffett has never recommended Berkshire stock. Instead, he has regularly advised investors to periodically purchase shares of an index fund that tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). That strategy provides diversified exposure to hundreds of American businesses that are collectively \"bound to do well\" over time, according to Buffett.\n\nIndeed, history says investors can build an $903,800 portfolio over three decades by simply investing $350 per month in an S&P 500 index fund. Here's how.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides diversified exposure to hundreds of U.S. companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) measures the performance of 500 U.S. companies, a blend of value stocks and growth stocks from every market sector. The index fund covers about 80% of U.S. equities and nearly 50% of global equities by market capitalization, meaning it spreads money across many of the most influential companies in the world.\n\nOne tailwind that should send the S&P 500 higher in future years is artificial intelligence (AI). Just as e-commerce, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing drove the index higher in past years, many experts see AI as the next generation-defining investment theme. Indeed, the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (shown in the chart) are all well positioned to monetize AI in the future. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to hundreds of stocks that could benefit from artificial intelligence, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nHere's a look at each company.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is the largest enterprise software vendor and the second-largest cloud computing provider. The company is monetizing artificial intelligence with generative AI Copilots for its software products, and cloud AI services. Most notably, Microsoft Azure lets developers build generative AI applications with large language models from ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has cultivated brand authority across several consumer electronics verticals, and it has a particularly strong market presence in smartphones. The company undoubtedly lags its big tech peers in monetizing artificial intelligence, but upcoming versions of iOS will reportedly feature AI-powered search, summaries, photo editing, and other automations.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) offer unparalleled performance when accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence applications. The company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, and its extensive product ecosystem -- spanning hardware, software, and services -- makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for building entire AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the market leader in digital advertising and the third-largest cloud computing provider, and it's leaning into artificial intelligence across both product categories with its Gemini model. Specifically, Gemini simplifies ad campaign creation with natural language, supports the development of generative AI applications, and automates work in its office productivity suite Google Workspace.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) enjoys a leadership position in e-commerce, retail advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is using artificial intelligence across all three product categories. Rufus is an AI-powered shopping assistant, Amazon Ads offers generative AI for creating brand images, and Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service for developing generative AI applications.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 is a cheap, easy way to build wealth\n\nThe S&P 500 is a proven moneymaker. The index outperformed virtually every other asset class over the last two decades, from international equities and fixed income to real estate and precious metals, and it has been a profitable investment over every 20-year period in history.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 1,970% over the last 30 years, compounding at 10.62% annually. At that pace, $350 invested monthly would be worth $74,200 in one decade, $288,100 in two decades, and $903,800 in three decades. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but even a more conservative growth rate of 10% annually would turn $350 invested monthly into $791,000 over three decades.\n\nWarren Buffett believes \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" His logic is simple: The U.S. is the largest and arguably the most innovative economy in the world. Indeed, 16 of the 20 largest companies in the world are U.S. companies, and the U.S. stock market is by far the largest.\n\nThat makes a compelling argument for investing in U.S. stocks, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is essentially a basket of the most successful U.S. companies. Additionally, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning the annual fees will total $3 for every $10,000 invested, the index fund is a cheap and easy way to build wealth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet Wall Street's Newest Stock-Split Stock -- a Company on the Cutting Edge of the Hottest Innovation",
        "content": "Though Wall Street is firmly entrenched in a bull market right now, it's been nothing short of a wild ride for investors since this decade began. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite were whipsawed between bear and bull markets in successive years from 2020 through 2023.\n\nWhen uncertainty is a prevailing theme on Wall Street, it's not uncommon for investors of all walks to seek out the safety of industry-leading businesses that have handily outperformed the major stock indexes. For years, this had involved investors flocking to the \"FAANG stocks.\" But over the last three years, it's companies enacting stock splits that investors can't stop buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have gravitated to stocks conducting splits\n\nA \"stock split\" allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter both its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. I use the word \"cosmetic\" to make clear that stock splits have no effect on an underlying company's market cap or operating performance.\n\nStock splits come in two varieties: forward and reverse. A forward-stock split is designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for investors who might not be able to purchase fractional shares through their online broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase the share price of a publicly traded company to ensure its continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nWhile there have been a handful of stocks throughout the years that have gone on to be wildly successful following a reverse split, most investors are rightly chasing after companies conducting forward-stock splits. Businesses enacting forward splits are often out-innovating their competition and have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2021, roughly a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a forward-stock split, including FAANG components Amazon and Alphabet. Through less than five months of 2024, four new juggernauts have joined this elite club.\n\nWall Street's \"Class of 2024\" stock-split stocks\n\nStock-split announcements kicked off in late January when retail kingpin Walmart(NYSE: WMT) unveiled plans to conduct a 3-for-1 forward split. Although Walmart's share price wasn't absurdly high at the time (around $165), the company's management team wanted to ensure that its associates would be able to purchase whole shares if they chose to participate in the Associate Stock Purchase Plan.\n\nWalmart began trading at its split-adjusted price on February 26, which is also the day S&P Dow Jones Indices made a few changes to the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average. Given Walmart's ability to use its size to its advantage in order to undercut its competition on price, this is unlikely to be the company's last stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext up was fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), whose share price was near $3,000 when, in March, it announced its intent to conduct a 50-for-1 forward split in late June. Like Walmart, Chipotle's management team wants to split its stock to make it more accessible to its team members.\n\nShares of Chipotle have skyrocketed more than 14,200% since its January 2006 initial public offering price of $22. In addition to providing fresher foods that consumers have clearly shown they'll pay a premium for, Chipotle has benefited immensely by keeping its menu compact. A smaller menu helps its staff quickly prepare meals.\n\nAfter Chipotle came Sony Group(NYSE: SONY). The Japan-based consumer electronics company announced a 5-for-1 stock split on May 14, with an effective date for the company's American depositary receipts (ADRs) of October 8. This is Sony's first stock split in 24 years.\n\nDespite slower sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 gaming console, which debuted in late 2020, the company has enjoyed solid sales growth from its PlayStation Plus subscription service, which allows gamers to save their data in the cloud and play multiplayer games with their friends. Sales of the company's image sensors, which are used in next-generation smartphones, have been strong, too.\n\nNow, Wall Street has a fourth stock-split stock of 2024, and it's a familiar name: artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nSay hello to Wall Street's newest stock-split stock\n\nInterestingly enough, Nvidia is one of the roughly \"dozen high-profile companies\" I alluded to earlier that have increased investors' fascination with stock-split stocks since the midpoint of 2021.\n\nFollowing the closing bell on May 22, Nvidia released its operating results for the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28) and announced a 10-for-1 forward split that'll become effective before trading begins on June 10. This marks the sixth split since Nvidia became a public company, and its first since July 2021, when it completed a 4-for-1 split.\n\nAs has become the norm over the last 18 months, Nvidia mud-stomped Wall Street's consensus sales and profit expectations for the April-ended quarter. Net sales more than tripled to $26 billion from the prior-year period, with Data Center revenue surging 427% from what was reported in the comparable quarter in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe catalyst for Nvidia is undeniably AI. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are what fuel the split-second decision-making needed in high-compute data centers handling generative AI solutions and training large language models. It's been estimated that Nvidia's chips account for around 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nNvidia has also been a prime beneficiary of demand absolutely swamping supply. Even with top chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing meaningfully increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity -- high-bandwidth memory is packaged on CoWoS and is a veritable necessity for AI-accelerated data centers -- Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting AI-GPU demand. As a result, it's enjoyed otherworldly pricing power for its chips and increased its gross margin to north of 78%.\n\nBased solely on Nvidia's operating results over the last year and change, the company appears unstoppable.\n\nBut looks can be deceiving. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHistory is going to catch up with Nvidia sooner than later\n\nWhile it's difficult to find a flaw in Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter operating results, the company's guidance and history provide clues that suggest this stock-split stock could be knocked off of its pedestal sooner than later.\n\nOne of the more glaring concerns for Nvidia is how next-big-thing innovation trends have fared over the last three decades.\n\nBeginning with the advent of the internet, every next-big-thing innovation has navigated its way through an early innings bubble precipitated by lofty investor expectations. In simpler terms, investors have a terrible habit of overestimating how quickly a new technology, innovation, or trend will be adopted. History suggests it's highly unlikely for artificial intelligence to be the exception to this unwritten rule. While Nvidia's GPUs can still be wildly successful over the long run, the company's stock maintaining its nearly parabolic move higher probably isn't in the cards.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter guidance also raised a red flag that likely flew over the heads of most investors. During the first quarter, Nvidia's gross margin (net sales less cost of revenue) tipped the scales at 78.4%. But for the second quarter, Nvidia is forecasting an adjusted gross margin of 75.5%, give or take 50 basis points.\n\nThis forecast retracement in gross margin of close to three percentage points is likely the result of two factors. First, Nvidia is starting to contend with its first real bout of external competition. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are both rolling out their respective H100 GPU rivals. Even if Nvidia's chips are preferred in data centers, the mere presence of these external competitors will lessen AI-GPU scarcity and almost certainly weaken Nvidia's pricing power.\n\nThe other probable issue is competition from within. Nvidia's top customers include Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet. Together, these four companies account for about 40% of its net sales. The problem is that all four are developing AI-GPUs of their own for their data centers. More than likely, this is the peak quarter for Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nWhile stock-split stocks are expected to remain all the rage on Wall Street, they're not all worth investing in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are on fire -- but this isn't a short-term phenomenon. The chip designer's stock has been on the rise for a few years. It took off in 2020, and since that time, it's soared more than 1,600%.\n\nInvestors have piled into the stock on optimism about the company's position in artificial intelligence (AI), a market forecast to grow in the double digits to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Today, Nvidia is the world's AI chip leader, with a market share of more than 80%. But that isn't the only reason investors are excited about the stock. One favorable trend explains why Nvidia shares have become unstoppable. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe data center business\n\nFirst, it's important to note that Nvidia's data center business includes all of the revenue it makes through its AI products and services. Rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Intel also have data center businesses and have been ramping up their offerings to compete with Nvidia.\n\nHere's the favorable trend that's boosted the company's stock. As shown in the chart below, Nvidia's data center revenue has climbed -- and actually roared higher as of early last year -- while the data center revenue of rivals has lagged behind. Intel's data center revenue actually has declined from earlier levels. Data source: Statista.\n\nInvestors like this trend of growth because it gives them confidence that Nvidia is staying ahead of its rivals. The idea that the company has what it takes to keep the increasing revenue trend going will keep the positive share price momentum. The tech giant has pledged to continue innovation to make that happen, and it's set for what may be its biggest launch yet: The release later this year of its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia's AI chips, the company sells entire platforms to help customers launch their AI programs, so the revenue opportunity is broad. All of this means Nvidia's explosive growth may be far from over, and this could equal significant gains for the stock over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

And last week's milestone certainly seems to justify that thesis.\n\nBut with the stock market recently hitting a fresh all-time high, AI enthusiasm perhaps getting a bit bubbly, and interest rates and inflation remaining stubbornly higher than we'd like, is it really a good time to be buying the S&P 500 today?\n\nThe case against buying the S&P 500 here\n\nFor those cautious on the markets, you can find plenty of good reasons to hold off on buying the stock market averages. For one, the S&P, as a market-cap weighted index, is dominated by large technology companies which have gone up a tremendous amount recently, as part of a bull market that has lasted really since October of 2022.\n\nThe combination of interest rates appearing to top out, inflation having decreased from its peak of 9.1% in June of 2022 to just 3.4% last month, and tailwinds from the artificial intelligence boom have spurred large technology companies to fresh new heights.\n\nAnd new highs aren't just being reached by Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which just reached an eye-watering market cap of $2.6 trillion with a high P/E ratio of 62. Most of the cloud giants, as well as associated semiconductor stocks have also rocketed higher on the back of strong perceived growth that will carry on into the future indefinitely.\n\nBut will it? After all, AI investment will have to justify its end benefits to companies and consumers, and companies are now spending unprecedented amounts on AI chips and data centers out of fear of being left behind. Sound familiar? This current boom has faint echoes of the dot-com buildout in the late 1990s, which saw several boom years as internet mania took hold, only for the bubble to burst in 2000. That bursting led to an epic crash and recession, causing an unprecedented three consecutive years of declines for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which declined by an epic 76.8% from peak-to-trough, while the S&P 500 fell a more mild but still nauseating 49.1%.\n\nCould the AI bubble burst in a similar fashion? AI momentum certainly doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon. But on the other hand, few saw the crash of 2000 coming either, believing internet hypergrowth would last forever and not revert back toward the growth rate of GDP. Someday, it's likely that there will be an AI company that reports a slowdown or digestion in growth, and these high-flying stocks could correct in a big way. Will that day occur soon? Probably not, but it's hard to tell.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, inflation affects what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates, and higher interest rates tend to depress stock valuations as well as the economy. With inflation remaining somewhat \"sticky,\" and disappointing to the upside of expectations over the past couple months, it's possible the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer in order to reach it's 2% inflation target.\n\nThat could be a problem, as the S&P 500 trades at an historically above-average valuation. Today, the S&P 500 index currently trades at 27.6 times trailing earnings. That's actually quite high by historical standards, as the average valuation for the index over the course of history is 16.1.\n\nSo if interest rates and inflation surge again, it could certainly be a dangerous time to invest in this frothy market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for buying the S&P 500\n\nOn the other hand, as famed investor Peter Lynch once said, \"there is always something to worry about\" in markets.\n\nWhile the average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 over the course of market history is much lower than today's, the market has tended to trade at a higher P/E ratio in recent years. In fact, the average is around 22.5 over the past 10 years. While below today's prices, that's still much closer. Meanwhile, had you sat out of investing in the stock market over the past decade on fears of high valuations, you would have missed out on 236% gains, including dividends, over that time. ^SPXTR Chart\n\nFurthermore, the average returns of the S&P 500 since 1928 through 2023, when the Standard & Poor's index was first developed, is around 9.9%, with dividends reinvested. And since the index formally expanded to 500 companies in 1957, the long-term annualized return has been an even better 10.3%.\n\nOf course, there have been several specific moments just on the cusp of huge market crashes when one might not have wanted to invest. However, a study by Ben Carlson, author of the blog A Wealth of Common Sense, points out that if your time horizon is long enough, even investing at market peaks just before stock market crashes have still paid off over the long run. Carlson looked at returns of theoretical investments made right before eight of the market's worst crashes, from September of 1929 to October of 2007, before the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nLooking five years out, three of those investments would have still yielded positive results. 10 years out, six of those eight investments would have been profitable, with three yielding triple-digit gains. And 20 years after investing at the eight very worst possible times in market history, all eight would have been profitable, with returns for every investment except September 1929 yielding multi-hundreds-of-percent gains.\n\nStick to your stock plan\n\nOf course, prudent investing doesn't only amount to one-time, large investments. Rather, if you save a portion of your income and dollar-cost-average into an index fund every month, yes, you'll invest before some market peaks, but you'll also average that out by investing in subsequent downturns.\n\nMarket crashes are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict. But as we've seen from history, even investments made before the worst market peaks and crashes eventually heal themselves, as the earnings of American business grows over time. Meanwhile, trying to time the market can cost you big-time, as we've seen from those who have sat out of the market for the past 10 years.\n\nTherefore, the S&P 500 appears to be a fine buy today, even at its elevated valuation, provided that you have a consistent investing plan and stick with regular monthly, quarterly, or annual allocations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Stock to Buy Before It Breaks New Ground in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Next Month",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the biggest driving forces behind the current bull market.\n\nIn the 18 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 33%. The AI trend has been fueled by announcements from Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and practically every other major tech company in the world. There's no doubt AI development has advanced considerably in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nOne company has been relatively quiet when it comes to what it's working on, but management promised to \"break new ground\" in generative AI this year. And those groundbreaking announcements could come in just a few weeks.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is set to take the wraps off its AI development and partnerships at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which starts June 10. Here's what investors can expect and what it means for the stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's AI ambitions are different from the rest of big tech\n\nCentral to Apple's brand is a focus on data privacy and security. As such, it'll highlight the fact that most of its AI features will work on your personal devices.\n\nApple has built its own large language model capable of features like summarizing missed notifications, providing a synopsis of a news article, or transcribing voice memos, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. It'll also improve upon existing features like auto-populating your calendar, suggesting apps, and editing photos.\n\nNone of these features are particularly groundbreaking in and of themselves. But the promise of more on-device AI capabilities down the road as Apple improves its LLM could be the bigger story. As AI features play an increasingly larger role in our digital lives, the ability to keep data private and secure with on-device processing may be the next big step forward in AI, with Apple leading the charge.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Apple knows there's huge demand for AI features it can't necessarily deliver with its current on-device capabilities. As such, it's struck a partnership deal with OpenAI to integrate some of its technology into the next iteration of iOS. It's also held talks with Google to use its Gemini model, but they have yet to come to an agreement.\n\nApple's secret weapon as it races to catch up in AI\n\nOne of the biggest limiting factors in developing AI technology is the need for compute power. Nvidia has a stranglehold on the high-end GPU market, and it can't make chips fast enough to keep up with demand. While that's been great for Nvidia's bottom line, it makes it extremely costly for big tech companies building out data centers full of Nvidia GPU clusters.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost every big tech company that's currently using Nvidia chips for their AI data centers is developing their own chips for training large language models, including Microsoft and Alphabet. But developing cutting-edge chips is hard, and getting them manufactured takes a long time.\n\nApple is using its own chips in its AI data centers, which saves it money and reduces the potential for bottlenecks other big tech companies may experience as they procure Nvidia chips and print their own. Apple is currently using the M2 Ultra chips found in the Mac Pro computer for its data centers. Next year, it could switch to the M4 chips found in the latest version of the iPad Pro released earlier this month. Its existing manufacturing relationships mean it can be very fast and cost effective in building out data centers as it ramps up its AI efforts.\n\nThe fact that it's using the same chips to train its LLM as it uses in its devices is also promising for the future of on-device AI capabilities for Apple's products.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nIt's unlikely Apple will monetize many of its new AI features directly. Instead, the new capabilities may push a large portion of Apple's 2.2 billion user base to upgrade their devices. On-device AI capabilities may only be available on the latest hardware and may encourage more device storage for all those AI-edited photos and videos.\n\nThe majority of iPhones in use in the United States are more than two years old, with about one-third of users holding their phones for three years or longer. These devices are ripe for an upgrade, especially if Apple gives iPhone owners a bit of a push. That could lead to a surge in sales for fiscal 2025, which starts in October. New iPhone models typically come out in September.\n\nMeanwhile, advanced AI capabilities built into the iPhone could open the door for developers to build new AI-powered apps. Apple could capitalize by building what analyst Dan Ives is calling an \"AI App Store.\" AI-enabled features, such as circle-to-search found on Google's Pixel phones, could drive more traffic to search engines. And Apple could see a nice boost to its services revenue if it does. Court documents revealed Apple receives a 36% cut of all of Google's search revenue on iPhones, Macs, and iPads.\n\nAI could fuel sales in the two biggest segments of Apple's business in fiscal 2025. The announcements next month could be just the start.\n\nWhile shares are approaching their all-time high again, the stock still looks attractive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio approaching 30 may curb its appeal for some, but a premium price is justified due to its massive share repurchase program, its existing net cash position, and the long-term outlook for another period of strong earnings growth next year and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Monday, with focus largely on more cues on interest rates from key inflation data due later in the week.\n\nThe Memorial Day holiday kept trading volumes slim. But volumes are set to pick up this week with a barrage of key economic readings, including revised first quarter gross domestic product data.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,327.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.2% to 18,918.0 points by 19:06 ET (23:06 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.1% to 39,192.0 points.\n\nPCE inflation test due this week\n\nPCE price index data, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, is due this Friday.\n\nThe reading is likely to factor into the central bank’s outlook on interest rates, and will be closely watched after a string of Fed officials warned that sticky inflation will delay any plans to loosen monetary policy.\n\nThis saw traders begin pricing out expectations for a rate cut in September. The CME Fedwatch tool shows traders pricing in a 50.7% probability the central bank will keep rates steady, along with a 43.6% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut.\n\nFriday’s PCE reading is expected to show some cooling in inflation. But inflation is also set to remain well above the Fed’s 2% annual target range.\n\nWall St in sight of record highs, volatility increases\n\nGains in technology stocks, chiefly market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), helped the NASDAQ Composite end at a record high last week. The index also clocked some gains for the week.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also tested record levels, they were held back by losses in most other sectors, amid concerns over high for longer interest rates.\n\nHigh rates dent the appeal of risk-driven assets such as equities. They also limit the amount of liquidity in the market which can be invested into stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended up 0.7% at 5,304.72 points on Friday, while the Nasdaq closed up 1.1% at a record high of 16,920.79 points. The Dow ended flat at 39,069.59 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures inch higher in slim trade as PCE data approaches\n\nBP, Shell and EOG vie for acreage in Trinidad's oil and gas auction\n\nStellantis to introduce Italy-made hybrid versions of Fiat 500 EV, Jeep Compass\n\nView comments",

Still, companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) comprise an increasingly high position in the index’s overall ranking and that is reasonable cause for concern for those prioritizing effective diversification planning.\n\nAt the same time, plenty of stinkers exist among S&P 500 stocks, making broad-based index investing less than ideal. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are each down nearly 40% since January alone, with indications that each (and others) is facing further pain ahead.\n\nThat’s why focusing your S&P 500 stocks to buy selection on a handful of well-known names near the top coupled with diversified, lesser-known winners in the middle is a surefire way to create an alternate series of S&P 500 investments — without the relative overweight of a select few companies, while simultaneously cutting out some dead wood.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

Well-loved, pervasive, and continually expanding, Amazon’s wide-ranging offerings and cultural innovation ensure that the company will remain a staple in our lives for the foreseeable future — not to mention part of our collective investment portfolios.\n\nWhile Amazon’s ongoing retail efforts impact consumers and are noteworthy in their own right, Amazon’s potential as a long-term player among S&P 500 stocks is its cloud service segment. As more companies pivot to remote models or try to save hardware costs by relying on cloud data storage, Amazon’s web services are becoming a key part of many other business models and operations. That’s why Amazon’s recent $25 billion quarterly sales stat is huge news — Amazon is on track to secure $100 billion from its web service segment alone, setting up a perpetual cash flow machine as network switching costs tend to be high and existing clients stick with what they know.\n\nDeere & Co (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co (NYSE:DE) is one of my favorite S&P 500 stocks to buy. But it’s in an unlikely category: robotics and automation. While robotics and automation are hot topics, Deere tends to go under-appreciated in a wider market that favors startups and more niche offerings. That’s a mistake because—once Deere unveils the full scope and extent of its robotics offerings—the company could quickly become one of the top robotics stocks in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeere’s flagship offerings in the category include fully autonomous tractors and tillage machines, which leverage advanced mapping and sensing tech to save agricultural producers time and energy when it comes to prepping fields or harvesting.\n\nAnd, while the autonomous tractors have clear and viable operational prospects today, Deere could see big money coming down the pipe in the future as part of licensing agreements to leverage its newly developed tech.\n\nFor example, self-driving car companies could license portions of Deer’s neural network sensing mechanisms that determine if the area is safe to drive over or not, or drone delivery startups could license Deer’s mapping tools to build a city delivery overlay.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a powerhouse among S&P 500 stocks to buy, seamlessly integrating innovative technology, robotics, and the global growth trajectory of healthcare. As a key player in both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical is undeniably stable and increasingly relied upon as a provider of high-end, specialized medical equipment.\n\nUnlike competitors focused on conventional medical hardware, Intuitive Surgical revolutionizes surgery to enhance provider efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nThe company is expanding aggressively worldwide as the healthcare industry continues its post-pandemic rebound. The latest quarterly report highlighted a significant 16% year-over-year increase in the global use of its premier robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, and a consistent installation rate (312 units installed in Q1 2023 and 313 units installed this year).\n\nThis progress, coupled with an 11% sales increase and a rise in net income to $545 million from $355 million, solidifies Intuitive Surgical’s position as one of today’s top stocks to buy.\n\nKeep an eye on Intuitive Surgical this year as the company unveils its next-generation da Vinci platform. According to CEO Gary Guthart, this new model will boast “10,000 times the processing power” of current versions, significantly enhancing data analysis, sensing technology, and overall digital and analytical functions.\n\nVICI Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nVICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) owns and partially operates multiple famous Las Vegas properties, including Caesar’s Palace, the Venetian, and MGM Grand.\n\nThis impressive portfolio alone makes VICI worth considering, as Vegas will unlikely lose its global appeal anytime soon. The REIT entered the public market relatively recently, in 2017, following Caesars Entertainment’s (NASDAQ:CZR) bankruptcy proceedings. While Caesars Entertainment still operates Caesars Palace, VICI owns the land and property itself, creating a self-sustaining flywheel that effectively transfers cash from gamblers’ pockets into VICI’s with minimal disruption in the middle.\n\nSince its IPO, VICI’s stock has returned 60%, with gross returns exceeding 120% when factoring in dividends. VICI has maintained a solid 5%+ dividend over the past seven years, with its current 12-month trailing yield at 5.78%. This competitive yield beats most high-yield savings accounts today while the stock itself offers plenty of room to run — in other words, typifying the best long-term S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nI think Elon Musk, love him or hate him, remains a once-in-a-generation business magnate and eternal innovator. That’s why, despite recent challenges, I see buying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at today’s prices as one of the best long-term investment opportunities among all S&P 500 stocks.\n\nMoreover, the company’s current prospects are better than many suggest. While car sales have slumped, this reflects the broader economic landscape rather than Tesla’s potential. Additionally, Tesla is maturing and diversifying its revenue streams, similar to legacy automakers and their cash flow-generating machines.\n\nIn its most recent filing, Tesla posted a 25% increase in services and a 7% rise in energy generation and storage sales. Although these top-line increases often go unnoticed, they are crucial. As Tesla’s market matures, early forays into alternative revenue streams will be essential for its long-term positioning.\n\nFinally, Musk’s promises of developing artificial intelligence and robotics within the wider Tesla ecosystem have real potential. It may take another decade to realize those gains, much like Tesla’s stock over the past ten years, but the long-term prospects are promising.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is often top-of-mind when mentioning tech stocks to buy, and for good reason. The company’s pervasive operational arms touch most of us daily, fostering a culture of growth and innovation. Fortunately for long-term buyers, the current per-share pricing is discounted after shares slid due to management’s spending breakdown and a muted sales forecast, despite a 117% increase in quarterly net income. Meta’s performance indicators were stellar for the first quarter of 2024, with highlights including higher daily active user rates, improved ad impressions, increased ad spending, and over $15 billion returned to shareholders. Despite this, the stock dropped dramatically — but don’t let that dissuade you.\n\nMuch of the short-term turbulence came from higher cost projections, which is actually a positive sign. A planned record-high series of capital expenditures, primarily focused on enhancing Meta’s artificial intelligence capabilities, weighed on investors’ minds. Zuckerberg noted that this would “grow [Meta’s] investment envelope meaningfully before [it makes] much revenue from some of these new products.”\n\nWhile some may view Zuckerberg’s varied metaverse initiatives as a historical pre-play for Meta’s AI prospects, it’s important to consider the company’s long history of forward-thinking projections that take time to bear fruit. Given Meta’s track record, this temporary dip presents a compelling opportunity among S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is last on the list of S&P 500 stocks to buy. Unlike Google (NASDAQ: GOOG, NASDAQ: GOOGL), it offers institutional and individual investors smart money management, significant long-term upside, and forward-thinking management that continues to innovate despite the company’s size.\n\nMicrosoft’s strategic positioning within the AI sector will likely benefit the company significantly in the future. Even if you’re skeptical of some of the more extravagant AI claims, it’s clear that AI threatens legacy search engines while offering new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft’s existing software suite. Microsoft’s investment in leading AI firm OpenAI gives it a front-row seat and a strong position to capitalize on the next big technological advancements.\n\nWe find ourselves in a position similar to the early 2000s, when the potential of search engine technology was just emerging, and no one fully grasped its future profitability. No public company is as well-aligned with that future potential as Microsoft, and its role in doing so aligns itself well with nearly every prudent investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Workday Inc. WDAY recently announced that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has opted to utilize Workday Government Cloud to expedite human resource modernization initiatives. The Workday Government Cloud offers the essential tools and insights, enabling organizations to optimize their workforce efficiently.

With a unified data core, WDAY’s HR system eliminates inefficiencies in the talent acquisition process and reduces the time to hire and equip management to compete for top talent.\r\n\r\nThe solution offers management greater visibility, enabling better assessment of workforce map, retention risks, skill gap, employee sentiment and more. It centralizes all HR data into a single system and empowers leadership to make more informed decisions and enhance collaboration among different teams. Workday’s employee-centric talent foundation increases employee retention by providing personalized employee experiences and provides tools to improve productivity.\r\n\r\nU.S. intelligence community and federal agencies are increasingly grappling with several challenges in their HR processes. Recruitment and onboarding of top talent, identification and integration of personnel with the right expertise to nullify the skill gaps amid shifting demographics, have become a daunting task. On top of that, swift technological changes and reliance on legacy systems prolonged the hiring process, resulting in the loss of young potential talent.\r\n\r\nAn estimate suggests that only 7% of the current federal workforce is under the age of 30 and nearly 30% are set to retire within the next five years. Against this backdrop, there is a growing demand for innovative HR solutions to address the issues of an aging workforce, the retirement of experienced employees and a smaller pool of young workers in the public sector agencies.\r\n\r\nWorkday boasts a comprehensive human resource management portfolio that can address these issues and facilitate the creation of a diverse, trusted and agile workforce. Around 35 federal and government clients have deployed Workday solutions around the world.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +21.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 28.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +121.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $25.10 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +93.7%. This estimate has changed +4.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.69 indicates a change of +18.3% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +109.1%. The $114.17 billion and $142.29 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +87.4% and +24.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $6.12 for the same period compares with $1.09 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Nvidia Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute & Networking.\r\n\r\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\r\n\r\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $230,327.74, or a gain of 22,932.77%, as of May 27, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 179.12% and the price of gold increased 77.20% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the past year. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nShares have gained 21.35% over the past four weeks and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "10 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Commanding a staggering $7.2 trillion in assets under management, Vanguard stands as an indomitable force in the mutual fund and exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape.\n\nFor many long-term investors, Vanguard's ETFs and mutual funds are the go-to choices, and there's a good reason why. Image Source: Getty Images.\n\nShareholder-friendly policies and a diversity of options\n\nAt the heart of Vanguard's appeal lies its unwavering commitment to shareholders. The fund family's policies are meticulously designed to benefit investors by minimizing fees. After all, low fees translate to more money in your pocket, rather than lining the coffers of money managers.\n\nAnother main attraction for long-term investors is the diversity of fund types offered by the fund family. Vanguard's suite of 86 exchange-traded funds offers a comprehensive range of options for investors seeking diversified portfolios and long-term value creation.\n\nWhile Vanguard's ETFs are a popular choice, they may not all be suitable for the everyday investor. Certain funds are crafted for more sophisticated financial maneuvers like hedging, which contrasts with the straightforward and proven method of dollar-cost averaging that many individual investors prefer for building their wealth.\n\nArmed with this insight, I've sorted through Vanguard's broad ETF portfolio to spotlight 10 of the best stock funds for most Main Street investors. These ETFs sport top levels of performance, ultra-low expense ratios, and exposure to powerful themes like artificial intelligence, weight-loss drugs, an aging global population, and other long-term trends in the marketplace.\n\nRead on to find out more about these top Vanguard stock ETFs.\n\nThese Vanguard funds are potent wealth creators\n\n1. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) tracks the S&P 500 index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies. It comes with an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.03% and a 30-day SEC yield of 1.36%. The VOO is well diversified across economic sectors, despite its top holdings – Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon, and Alphabet – all from the tech sector.\n\nThe primary reason to own VOO is its potential for capital appreciation in a moderately low-risk manner (low-risk for stocks). The VOO, in short, provides exposure to the heart of the American economy, which has been the world's best value creator in recorded history. That's why this Vanguard S&P 500 tracking vehicle often forms the foundation of many professional and non-professional portfolios. VOO Total Return Level Chart\n\n2. Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nThe Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund ETF(NYSEMKT: VO) seeks to track the CRSP US Mid Cap Index, offering exposure to mid-capitalization stocks with an expense ratio of 0.04% and a 30-day SEC yield of 1.59%. Its top holdings include Amphenol Corp, Transdigm Group, and Constellation Energy.\n\nStory continues VOO Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe VO is favored for its balance of risk and return, providing a convenient way to match the performance of medium-sized companies. Although mid-caps have lagged behind the broader markets since 2018 and the performance gap has widened substantially post-pandemic, this equity group has historically delivered excess returns relative to the S&P 500.\n\nA well-balanced portfolio should have some exposure to this group in case a trend reversal takes shape.\n\n3. Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nInvestors eyeing small-cap companies with promising growth trajectories may find the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF Shares(NYSEMKT: VB) a perfect match. This fund is designed to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Small Cap Index. With an expense ratio of just 0.05% and a 30-day SEC yield of 1.45%, it stands out for low fees and a robust yield. VB Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe fund's top three holdings are Targa Resources, Axon Enterprise, and Builders FirstSource. Unlike traditional small-caps, these are all well-established companies with stellar revenue and earnings growth. The VB presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity for those comfortable with higher risk in exchange for the potential of above-average growth.\n\n4. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nIf you're looking for extensive exposure to the U.S. stock market, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF(NYSEMKT: VTI) is worth considering. This ETF is specifically designed to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which includes equities from large-, mid-, and small-cap categories, spanning both growth and value styles.\n\nWhat makes the VTI stand out within its category are the following features:\n\nLow expense ratio: The VTI sports a rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.03%. Decent yield: It offers a 30-day SEC yield of 1.35%, which is an average yield among U.S. dividend-paying equities. Top holdings: The VTI's top holdings closely resemble those of the S&P 500, with a tilt toward large-cap tech companies.\n\nHowever, what truly sets the VTI apart is its expansive portfolio. Comprising 3,719 stock holdings, it significantly surpasses the benchmark S&P 500 in terms of size.\n\nThis extensive diversification enhances the margin of safety for investors and positions the VTI as a fundamental building block in many investment portfolios.\n\n5. Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nFor international diversification, the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF(NASDAQ: VYMI) is a standout pick. It tracks the FTSE All-World ex US High Dividend Yield Index, sports a fairly reasonable expense ratio of 0.22% for an international high-yield fund, a yield of nearly 5%, and provides exposure to foreign stocks forecasted to have above-average dividend yields.\n\nSpeaking to this last point, the VYMI's top three holdings, Toyota Motor Corp., Nestle SA, and Shell, all offer yields greater than the S&P 500. Thanks to the high-quality nature of its core holdings, the VYMI also screens as an exceptionally reliable vehicle for dividend income. The fund, however, has lagged behind the S&P 500 since inception: VYMI Total Return Level Chart\n\n6. Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nThe Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF Shares(NYSEMKT: VTV) stands out as an excellent choice for investors seeking reliable income and capital appreciation. This ETF tracks the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index, focusing on stocks with large market capitalizations and compelling valuations. It's particularly attractive due to its low expense ratio of 0.04% and 30-day SEC yield of 2.30%, which together offer a balance of cost-efficiency and income potential.\n\nThe VTV is distinguished by its top holdings, which include some of the most respected companies in the market, known for their strong management teams, solid business models, and consistent performance over the long term. The fund's top three holdings in Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, and JPMorgan Chase are a testament to its strategy of investing in high-quality companies that are likely undervalued relative to their intrinsic worth.\n\nThe VTV's performance closely mirrored that of the S&P 500 until a small handful of large-cap U.S. stocks, mainly Nvidia and Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY), drove the group to unprecedented heights in the post-pandemic world: ^SPX Chart\n\n7. Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nThe Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF Shares(NYSEMKT: VHT) offers investors a way to keep pace with the MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index. With an expense ratio of 0.10% and a 30-day SEC yield of 1.38%, it's a cost-effective option with a moderate income yield.\n\nThe VHT invests primarily in the healthcare sector, with major holdings in industry giants such as Eli Lilly, UnitedHealth Group, and Johnson & Johnson. This ETF is a play on the healthcare industry's well-known durability across market cycles and excellent prospects for long-term growth.\n\nWhile the VHT is oriented toward growth, its focused exposure to the heavily regulated healthcare sector does introduce a higher level of risk when compared to more diversified funds like the VOO or VTI. However, this healthcare fund is also one of the few that has been able to keep up with the surge in U.S. large-cap stocks since 2020: ^SPX Chart\n\n8. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG) tracks the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index. This ETF focuses on stocks that have consistently increased their dividends year after year--a strategy favored by super-investors like Warren Buffett.\n\nThe rationale behind this approach is that dividend growth serves as a reliable indicator of a healthy and robust business. Steadily growing dividends can also form a \"snowball\", compounding returns over time.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.06% and a 30-day SEC yield of 1.81%, the VIG screens as a cost-effective option for dividend growth strategists. Its top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, and Broadcom – all of whom have a long track of regular dividend raises. The fund hasn't delivered excess returns relative to the S&P 500 since inception, but it has performed admirably: ^SPX Chart\n\n9. Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nWant market-crushing levels of capital appreciation? The Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares(NYSEMKT: VUG) is a more concentrated version of the S&P 500 that has been steadily beating this benchmark index over the prior 10 years (see graph below). It caters to growth-oriented investors with an elevated risk tolerance. The VUG tracks the CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index, composed of 199 large-cap growth stocks. ^SPX Chart\n\nThe VUG's expense ratio stands at just 0.04%. However, its 30-day SEC yield is only 0.47%, reflecting the fund's focus on capital appreciation over income generation. The fund's top holdings mirror those of the S&P 500, only with a heavier concentration in top names like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia.\n\n10. Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares\n\nWant a shot at life-changing levels of capital appreciation? Your ticket may be the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF Shares(NYSEMKT: VGT). The VGT focuses on the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index, composed of large, medium-sized, and small U.S. companies operating in the information technology sector.\n\nThis Vanguard tech fund sports an expense ratio of 0.10% and a 30-day SEC yield of 0.58%. The fund's top three holdings are the same as the VUG, but with an even greater concentration in Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia, increasing its growth potential and risk profile.\n\nHowever, given the current surge in the tech sector driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, the perceived risk may be less significant than it appears. Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize our daily lives, and this trend is expected to propel the tech bull market for years to come. ^SPX Chart\n\nParting thoughts\n\nEach of these funds serves a distinct role in portfolio construction, catering to various investor preferences for the asset class, market capitalization, sector focus, and dividend strategy.\n\nInvestors can mix and match these ETFs to align with their risk tolerance, capital appreciation goals, and income needs, crafting a well-rounded investment portfolio that stands the test of time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Elon Musk earns praise from Nvidia co-founder Jensen Huang ahead of shareholder vote on pay package—‘Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars’",
        "content": "Nvidia’s star founder Jensen Huang endorsed Tesla’s strategy for AI-enabled autonomous vehicles weeks ahead of a key vote that determines if CEO Elon Musk receives his record compensation.\n\nMusk is all but betting the company on his recent pivot to AI, having quietly scuppered his vision of growing volumes more than tenfold to 20 million vehicles a year by 2030—as much as Toyota and Volkswagen sell combined.\n\n“Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,” Huang attested to in an interview with Yahoo Finance uploaded to YouTube late last week.\n\nThe AI pivot is controversial since it moves Tesla further away from its stated mission of accelerating the global transition to sustainable transportation. And while Musk’s so-called “supervised Full Self-Driving” may be the best-known advanced driver assist system (ADAS) on the market, few customers saw the value of plunking down $15,000 for a system that would require them to babysit their car as it attempts to navigate city streets.\n\nAs a result, Musk's been forced to slash the price back down to $8,000, the level it was when he first launched FSD beta in October 2020.\n\nHigh quality endorsement\n\nAn endorsement from the likes of Huang, whose draw at developer conferences now fill entire stadiums, could go a long way in assuaging investor concerns he himself might have veered off course.\n\n“The technology is really revolutionary and the work that they’re doing is incredible,” the Nvidia boss continued.\n\nWhat is this a rock concert? No it’s the Jensen Huang keynote at ⁦@nvidia’s⁩ #GTC24. Wow, what a difference a few years makes! pic.twitter.com/RqsiOg6Q2D\n\n— Bob O'Donnell (@bobodtech) March 18, 2024\n\nIn a couple of weeks, shareholders are due to vote a second time on Musk's record pay package—worth roughly $55 billion at the current stock price—after a Delaware court in January voided the original 2018 vote for procedural reasons related to the quality of Tesla’s governance.\n\nWith proxy advisors like Glass Lewis now recommending that investors vote against approving Musk's pay, the outcome of the June 13 annual meeting is proving tighter than expected.\n\nA vote of confidence in his new AI strategy from someone like Huang could boost his chances. Few businessmen are as respected as Huang, who founded Nvidia and managed its exponential growth over recent years thanks to a prescient bet on repurposing graphic processors to train AI models like OpenAI’s flagship GPT-4o.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk and Tesla gobbling up Nvidia AI chips at record pace\n\nHuang praised the twelfth and latest version of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which abandoned the previous approach of hard-coding commands in computer language in favor of relying solely on an AI-enabled neural network.\n\n“It learns from watching videos,” Huang said. “This technology is very similar to the technology of large language models, but it requires just an enormous training facility and the reason for that is because the data rate of video, the amount of data, is so, so high.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7iqeYx9HU\n\nThat said, Huang also knows how important Tesla is as a client. Musk is a voracious customer of Nvidia’s AI training chips, more than doubling his compute capacity just in the first quarter over the final three months of last year.\n\nDuring that period Tesla spent the staggering sum of $1 billion to build out its AI infrastructure, and that’s just the beginning. Tesla forecasts its compute capacity equivalent to 35,000 GPU clusters should hit 85,000 by year’s end, by which point it may have spent $10 billion.\n\nTo afford that kind of investment at a time when its core car business needs to keep offering margin-eroding incentives to keep sales from cratering, Musk is willing to go to almost any length to cut costs elsewhere.\n\nHe has already sacked thousands of employees, fired the team behind his industry-leading Supercharger network and scrapped plans to invest in all-new assembly lines for its a upcoming $25,000 entry model, now widely expected to be a Model 3 hatchback.\n\nBut if it helps Tesla hold onto its leadership in the EV industry—and make Musk $55 billion wealthier in the process—those sacrifices may not have been in vain.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) ​is down around 8% for the year, despite first-quarter financial results breezing past Wall Street estimates, with revenue rising 19%, primarily thanks to Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nReports indicate U.S. prosecutors are looking into Block’s financial transactions and are facing scrutiny about possible compliance problems at the company’s Square and Cash App businesses, contributing to shares dropping.\n\nBlock’s adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents were higher than the 72 cents that experts had predicted in Q1 2024, thanks to $5.96 billion in sales versus a $5.82 billion projection.\n\nGross profit rose 25% to $1.26 billion for Cash App. The monthly Cash App Card user base reached 24 million in March.

Revenues of $26.04 billion soared 262% year over year, marking the third straight quarter of growth in excess of 200%.\n\nThe metric also exceeded the consensus estimate of $24.33 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $6.12, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.49. This compares to earnings of $1.09 per share a year ago.\n\nThe company’s data center revenues soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. Gaming revenues were up 18% year over year to $2.65 billion. Professional visualization revenues and automotive sales came in at $427 million and $329 million, respectively.\n\nThe AI market has gathered pace in the past few years buoyed by the rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Up 1,080% in 4 Years to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares advanced 1,080% during the last four years, meaning $10,000 invested in the semiconductor company in May 2020 would now be worth $118,000. To put those numbers in context, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned 91% during the same period, such that $10,000 invested four years ago would now be worth $19,100.\n\nNvidia brought its share price down with a 4-for-1 stock split in July 2021, and the company now has a 10-for-1 stock split planned for next month. After the market closes on Friday, June 7, shareholders will receive nine new shares of Nvidia stock for every share owned at the previous close. To be clear, the split will have no direct impact on the value of the company, but it will make shares more affordable.\n\nDespite Nvidia's phenomenal run, 90% of Wall Street analysts that follow the company still rate the stock a buy, and the other 10% rate the stock a hold. Not a single analyst recommends selling. Nvidia bears a median price target of $1,200 per share, implying about 13% upside from its current price of $1,064 per share.\n\nHere's what investors should know about this artificial intelligence stock.\n\nNvidia is a leader in accelerated data center computing\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are the gold standard in (1) rendering ultra-realistic computer graphics in multimedia like video games and (2) accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company has an exceptionally strong presence in both markets, though its largest growth opportunities lie in the latter category.\n\nFor context, Wells Fargo data compiled by Eric Flaningam suggests that Nvidia accounted for 98% of data center GPU spending in 2023, and the company is expected to capture 94% market share in 2024. Perhaps more important, Nvidia accounted for 92% of spending on data center GPUs used for generative AI workloads in 2023, according to IoT Analytics.\n\nThat dominance is due in part to its full-stack strategy. GPUs are only one element of the data center stack, but other components are needed to build and run complex applications. That includes central processing units (CPUs), networking platforms, and software development tools. Nvidia addresses every layer of the stack. That makes the company a one-stop shop for AI training and inference, and it supports the rapid innovation that has kept Nvidia ahead of its peers.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang commented on that advantage during the latest earnings call. \"We're moving so fast and advancing [our systems] quickly because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything,\" he told analysts. \"This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia just delivered another blockbuster financial report\n\nNvidia reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28, 2024) that easily surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Revenue rose 262% to $26 billion on exceptional sales growth in the data center product category, which itself was driven by demand for generative AI systems. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share.\n\nThe chart below provides more detail on first-quarter revenue growth across Nvidia's four primary product categories. Nvidia's revenue growth by product category in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28, 2024). OEM & Other was excluded because it represented just 0.3% of total revenue.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia guided for $28 billion in second-quarter revenue, implying 75% growth. That easily beat the $26.6 billion Wall Street analysts anticipated. Management also guided for roughly $15.5 billion in non-GAAP net income, implying about 130% growth.\n\nMore importantly, CFO Colette Kress recently told analysts that \"demand may exceed supply well into next year\" due to the upcoming launch of Blackwell, the name given to Nvidia's next-generation AI factory platform. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing as compared to the previous Hopper GPU architecture.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a somewhat reasonable valuation\n\nThe graphics processor market is forecasted to compound at 28% annually through 2030, and AI spending across hardware, software, and services is projected to grow at 37% annually during the same period, according to Grand View Research. Based on those estimates, Nvidia has a good shot at annual earnings growth in the low-30% range (plus or minus a few points) through the end of the decade.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 38% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 62.3 times earnings seem relatively reasonable, especially compared to other AI stocks. I say that because those values (the price-to-earnings ratio divided by the forecasted earnings growth) give Nvidia a PEG ratio of 1.6. Meanwhile, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices has a PEG ratio of 5.8, and cloud services providers Alphabet and Microsoft have PEG ratios of 1.5 and 2.7, respectively.\n\nThat does not mean Nvidia shares are cheap, but the stock is (arguably) cheaper than AMD and Microsoft, and nearly as cheap as Alphabet. I think investors can buy a few shares of Nvidia right now, provided they keep their purchases small (maybe 2% of their portfolios). Investors should also understand the risks associated with Wall Street's lofty expectations. Nvidia stock could implode if the company fails to match earnings growth projections set by analysts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Lin called the trip an “important gesture of solidarity that shows America stands firmly with democratic Taiwan.”\n\nThe bipartisan delegation were the first US lawmakers to meet with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te since his inauguration on May 20. It comes days after Beijing staged expansive military exercises around Taiwan in what the US called “military provocations.”\n\nLai met the lawmakers in the morning and said Taiwan will continue to deepen cooperation with the US. He also cited former US President Ronald Reagan’s notion of “peace through strength” and pledged to bolster national defense.\n\nMcCaul said he had “very direct conversations” with Lai about the threat Taiwan faces from China.\n\n“What they did in the last couple of days was essentially a preview of what a blockade would look like,” he told reporters. “The key is to make sure the island has the weapons necessary for deterrence.”\n\nHe said he had put pressure on defense contractors and the Biden administration to get a backlog of weapons bought by Taiwan shipped as quickly as possible.\n\nBeijing has signaled its displeasure with Taipei’s new government in recent days, accusing Lai of seeking independence and destabilizing the region.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Still The Best AI Stock Pick of Billionaire Tepper?",
        "content": "Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th in our list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nBefore analyzing the stock, let's first see David Tepper's latest returns and his investing strategy for 2024.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.\n\nDavid Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.\n\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $399,373,520\n\nDavid Tepper piled into Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it was just getting started. The billionaire bought 150,000 shares of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the first quarter of 2023 at $216.41 per share. In the very next quarter the billionaire increased his stake in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a whopping one million shares and kept the stake steady through the third quarter of 2023. However, Tepper decreased his stake in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, ending the March quarter of this year with 442k shares of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nAppaloosa might be cutting its stake in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) but other hedge funds are continuing to pile into the stock. Insider Monkey's proprietary database of 919 hedge funds updated for the first quarter of 2024 shows that 186 hedge funds had stakes in Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the March quarter, up from 173 hedge funds in the previous quarter.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter, as the company continues to see accelerating demand for its GPU semiconductors from hyperscalers and enterprises. Nvidia’s GPU semiconductors continue to be the industry-leading building blocks of the accelerated computing data-center architecture to drive AI compute and applications.”\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on our list of Top 10 AI Stocks for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Opportunities in Uranium Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in evening deals on Sunday after fears of high interest rates saw volatile swings on Wall Street, with focus this week turning to key PCE inflation data for more cues on rates.\n\nTrading volumes were muted ahead of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,316.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 18,837.50 points by 19:53 ET (23:3 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,122.0 points.\n\nPCE inflation awaited for more rate cues\n\nPCE price index data- which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge- is due this Friday.\n\nWhile the reading is expected to show some cooling in personal spending and consumption, it also comes after a string of warnings from the Fed that sticky inflation will delay any potential interest rate cuts this year.\n\nThese warnings saw investors steadily price out expectations for a rate cut in September, which was initially pegged as the point when the Fed will begin loosening policy. The CME Fedwatch tool now shows investors pricing in a greater chance that the Fed will keep rates steady in September.\n\nWall Street sees increased volatility near record highs\n\nWall Street indexes clocked some record highs last week on support from positive earnings, particularly from market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThis helped the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite also clock a record-high close on Friday. It also marked some gains last week.\n\nBut most other stock sectors fell, with the S&P 500 andDow Jones Industrial Average seeing a mixed weekly performance.\n\nWhile the S&P ended last week largely flat, the Dow, which is seen as more economically sensitive, fell more than 2%.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended up 0.7% at 5,304.72 points on Friday, while the Nasdaq closed up 1.1% at a record high of 16,920.79 points. The Dow ended flat at 39,069.59 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures inch lower, PCE inflation test looms this week\n\nEarnings call: LexinFintech reports steady growth amid risk management efforts\n\nBill Gross says Trump is 'bearish' choice for bond markets\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently discussed some of the best artificial intelligence business ideas. While the best business idea for you may depend on your skill set and experience, we curated a list based on opinions from business experts. You can check out our free report on 18 Best AI Business Ideas in 2024.\n\nProminent AI startups: At a Glance\n\nAnthropic, Databricks, and Abridge are among the leading AI startups. Let’s take a look at their offerings and their position in the market. You can also take a look at the biggest publicly traded AI companies in the world.\n\nAnthropic is an artificial intelligence company based in the United States.

On March 20, Anthropic announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) to develop solutions for enterprises. 1,400 engineers at Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) are being trained to facilitate organizations in fine-tuning Anthropic’s AI models deployed on AWS. Claude, Anthropic’s AI model, is already deployed at the District of Columbia Department of Health. It can create a custom chatbot, also referred to as Knowledge Assist, and is provided through Amazon Bedrock. On March 27, CNBC announced that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was set to invest an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, bringing their total investment to $4 billion. As per Anthropic’s last valuation, the company is valued at $18.4 billion.\n\nDatabricks is another prominent artificial intelligence company based in California, United States.

        "content": "Nvidia Powers Up: AI Revolution Drives $22.6 Billion In Data Center Sales\n\nData center sales accounted for over $22.6 billion of Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) $26 billion in total revenue — a record for the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker.\n\n\"The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\" said Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang. \"AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient while expanding revenue opportunities.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible. Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nNvidia's revenue increased by 18% from the fourth quarter of last year and by 262% from a year ago. The company's data center segment grew 427% year-over-year, fueled by what Huang described as \"strong and accelerating demand\" for its Hopper platform.\n\nIn March, Nvidia launched its next-generation Blackwell platform and expects the new chips will further increase revenue in the second quarter.\n\nThe broader data center market continues to expand. Between 2017 and 2021, data center-related jobs increased by 20% nationwide to 3.5 million from 2.9 million, outpacing the 2% rise in overall U.S. employment, according to accounting firm PwC. For each direct data center job, another 7.4 ancillary jobs are created.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nAccording to NAIOP, vacancy rates are at historic lows of around 3% as businesses and the public embrace AI. Data creation is rampant even without AI, with about 200 million emails sent and 350,000 posts to X every minute. More than 100,000 hours per minute are spent on Zoom calls globally.\n\n\"This level of activity necessitates a substantial supportive infrastructure,\" Affinius Capital Senior Managing Director of Development Carrington Brown told NAIOP.\n\nInstitutional investors looking to boost their bottom line are also getting involved. According to Pat Lynch, managing director of CBRE’s Data Center Solutions group, Equinix and Digital Realty are leaders in the area, followed by private equity-backed companies like Carlyle, KKR, Macquarie, BlackRock, and Blackstone.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout 90% of data center transactions in the first half 2022 involved private equity firms. McKinsey & Co. expects the data center industry to grow from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to about 35 GW by 2030. Data centers are measured in megawatts rather than square feet.\n\n\"We are in the most significant data center development boom in the industry's history,\" said Curt Holcomb, JLL Executive Vice President, to NAIOP. \"The industry has seen consistent double-digit compound annual growth rates year after year. This growth is partly due to an imbalance in supply and demand, caused by COVID-induced halts in data center development over months. The introduction of AI has only added to an already robust demand. Hence, we predict that this boom will continue over the next two to three years, despite constraints on the power-delivery side.\"\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nA new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends.

It was the first congressional group to visit Taiwan since the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te on May 20.\n\nLai is scheduled to meet with the lawmakers on Monday to discuss peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, Taiwan-US trade relations and other issues, according to a readout from his office.\n\nAlso in the group were Representative Young Kim, Republican of California; Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina; Representative Jimmy Panetta, Democrat of California; Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky, and Representative Chrissy Houlahan, Democrat of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe US State Department on Saturday accused China of “military provocations” for staging expansive military exercises around Taiwan in the wake of the Lai inauguration.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia’s Huang landed in Taipei on Sunday evening, local cable news station TVBS reported. He is expected to make public appearances in an upcoming tech expo in Taipei. Huang has frequently mentioned the critical role Taiwan plays in the global AI supply chain, as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. makes the bulk of the world’s cutting-edge chips, including those designed by Nvidia.\n\n“Taiwan is at the epicenter of the world’s technology supply chain,” Huang said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on May 20. “The technology industry depends very heavily on Taiwan and continues to for some time.”\n\nThe trip is part of a broader visit by the delegation to the Indo-Pacific region, according to the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto US embassy in Taipei.\n\n(Adds context of regional visit in final paragraph.

        "title": "The AI Money Flow: Why You Can't Afford to Miss Stocks Like Nvidia and Snowflake",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is well underway. Kickstarted by OpenAI's ChatGPT introduction near the end of 2022, surging interest in generative AI and machine learning systems has rebalanced the stock market. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) carry two of the three largest market caps these days, largely thanks to their direct involvement in OpenAI's generative AI innovation. In the long run, the same ideas could reshape the global economy, too.\n\nOn the brink of a transformative AI era, it's crucial to consider not just the promises of innovation but also the broader economic and societal shifts at play. Will the rise of AI herald a new age of prosperity, or will it deepen existing inequalities? Do AI tools actually create wealth -- or simply redistribute assets to a new group of money-making kingpins?\n\nI can't claim to have all the answers, but let's start thinking about the dual nature of AI's economic impact. While I see the makings of groundbreaking wealth creation, there's likely some basic redistribution happening as well.\n\nSources of AI revenue and profits\n\nHave you ever thought about where Nvidia's and Microsoft's AI revenue streams start from? The current situation isn't radically different from what came before, but I think the world is headed down some very different economic avenues in the near future.\n\n1. AI-enabling hardware\n\nA significant portion of AI profits currently comes from the sale of hardware necessary for AI computations. Large Language Models (LLM) and machine learning systems need to be trained, and systems facing the final customer (which can be a consumer or a corporation) also need to manage the flow of AI requests and responses.\n\nIt's heavy computational lifting and requires a whole new level of processing power. Companies like Nvidia are seeing explosive growth due to their high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), which also serve as AI accelerators and are crucial for training and deploying AI models. The high demand for these components drives revenue and fuels high stock valuations.\n\n2. Software and services\n\nFollow the AI dollar another step up the food chain, and you'll see who's buying those expensive server-side AI chips.\n\nAI-driven software and platforms are another major revenue source. Microsoft, for example, integrates AI into its cloud services, offering advanced analytics, machine learning models, and AI-powered applications through the Azure cloud computing service. Subscription models and enterprise solutions provide steady revenue streams.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgain, a significant portion of the software-level income is passed down to hardware makers like Nvidia and system builders such as Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI). The data analytics and training software won't run on air or outdated calculator chips, after all. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Consumer products\n\nAnd who is paying the software giants? In many cases, it's the global consumer.\n\nAI is becoming increasingly embedded in consumer products. From AI-powered virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa to personalized recommendations on platforms like Netflix and Spotify, these applications drive user engagement and generate significant revenue through subscriptions, ads, and sales of smart devices. The next round of smartphone flagships is touting AI-boosted cameras and personal assistants. New cars come with SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) voice controls, powered by a unique machine learning system and channeled through the ChatGPT experience. It don't mean a thing if you ain't got that AI swing.\n\nThis is where the AI rubber hits the world-changing road. There's one more revenue stream to consider, but the AI boom won't get very far if consumers aren't paying for the newfangled computer tools in some way.\n\n4. Enterprise applications\n\nAnd here's the last stop on the road to AI wealth. Businesses across every sector are adopting AI to optimize operations, enhance decision-making, and add innovative features to their consumer-facing products. AI-driven solutions in healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing are creating substantial value, leading to increased investments in AI technologies and services.\n\nOnce again, a generous portion of this revenue is passed down the line through the software layer and to the hardware providers.\n\nIn this light, Nvidia's market-crushing surge is starting to make sense.\n\nFuture sources of AI-based winnings\n\nI think this is the start of a game-changing revolution. Others have compared the generative AI promise to the early days of the internet, the first smartphones, or steam engines launching the industrial revolution. Throw in the wheel, the electric guitar, or the first TV dinner, and we might be onto some significant innovations here.\n\nSo, where will the AI revenue streams start from in the future? In the end, all roads seem to lead right back to the consumer.\n\n1. Autonomous systems\n\nThe development of autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics should provide a serious revenue source, with AI brains at the proverbial wheel. Companies investing in these technologies, such as Tesla and Waymo, are pioneering advancements that could revolutionize transportation and logistics, potentially creating new markets and revenue streams.\n\nIn many cases, they will fight over the ordinary consumer's family budget. At some point, I'll consider selling my last car to rely on AI-driven robo-taxis for my transportation needs. That's fewer dollars headed to Detroit and the Japanese car giants but more cash aimed at the tech giants of AI automation. Ka-ching!\n\n2. AI-driven innovation\n\nAs AI technologies mature, they will likely spur the creation of entirely new industries and services. Biotech investors can look forward to AI-driven drug discovery, energy experts have smart power grids on their minds, and agriculture lovers should have precision farming soon -- all driven by artificial intelligence. I'm only scratching the surface of a vast opportunity here. The next game-changing AI breakthrough could emerge from any sector, as every industry is hunting for that killer AI innovation.\n\nThis explosion of computer-assisted innovation could open up vast new markets, contributing to more effective solutions and long-term revenue growth. In a very real sense, this involves creating more wealth from the world's existing resources.\n\n3. Data monetization\n\nAI relies heavily on data. System training starts with massive data stores, and AI is at its most efficient when it can auto-analyze a ton of relevant data. Companies that can effectively harness and monetize data will have a competitive edge. Businesses could profit by offering data-as-a-service (DaaS) models, providing insights and analytics to other companies while also leveraging their own operating data to enhance their services and customer experiences.\n\nSo, it's a mixed bag. The examples above include a direct consumer connection, a creator of more real-world value, and an intermediary layer that should boom as long as AI systems need more data. Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) and Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) are early leaders in this particular race, and Zebra Technologies' (NASDAQ: ZBRA) expertise in data collection and management shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nBalancing wealth creation and redistribution\n\nThe generative AI boom is poised to create significant wealth through a variety of channels, from hardware and software sales to groundbreaking innovations in new industries.\n\nHowever, the benefits of this wealth creation may not be evenly distributed. Investors stand to gain substantially, but broader societal impacts, such as job displacement and inequality, must be carefully managed. Ordinary consumers will benefit from better products and services, but the AI industry will also funnel a ton of money out of their wallets.\n\nBy weighing the opportunities against challenges, AI stakeholders can ensure that the sea change leads to sustainable economic growth and widespread benefits. This includes investing in education and retraining, promoting fair competition, and ensuring robust privacy protections. With a balanced approach to AI growth, the transformative power of AI can be harnessed while addressing its potential downsides, paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Semiconductors are the bedrock for many devices and resources that we use every day. They power our computers, TVs, automobiles and other everyday items. For years, semiconductor stocks have been outperforming the stock market. But, the recent artificial intelligence (AI) boom has resulted in even more growth for the industry.\n\nSome semiconductor stocks have amassed trillion-dollar valuations while others are on their way. However, investors should be more focused on which semiconductor stocks are poised to deliver positive future results. Consider some of the top picks to buy now.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been a top beneficiary of the AI boom. And, it appears it can realistically reach a $1 trillion market cap. Long-term investors have plenty of reasons to be happy as the stock gets closer to that milestone. Shares are up by 28% year-to-date (YTD) and have surged by 444% over the past five years! Despite those impressive gains, Broadcom still manages to offer a 1.51% yield for investors. Broadcom has maintained a 17.49% annualized dividend growth rate over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition, the semiconductor giant’s latest earnings report indicated that dividend growth and stock appreciation should continue. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year (YOY) as Broadcom integrates VMware into its core business. Also, the firm repurchased $8.29 billion worth of shares to increase shareholder value. Currently, the quarterly dividend stands at $5.25 per share.\n\nMoreover, analysts are bullish on Broadcom. It’s rated as a strong buy with a projected 13% upside. The highest price target of $1,720 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 23%.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors are monitoring Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) since its market cap is just shy of $100 billion.\n\nThe stock trades at a 65 P/E ratio and has rising profit margins. Shares are up by 18% YTD and have soared by more than 400% over the past five years. Wall Street analysts have rated the stock as a strong buy and are giving it a projected 11% upside. The highest price target of $675 per share implies a 15% gain is on the way.\n\nRecently, the semiconductor firm reported 15% YOY revenue growth in Q2 of fiscal year 2024 and 26% YOY growth in GAAP EPS. The company’s revenue was at the high end of guidance while its GAAP EPS exceeded guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Synopsys should gain additional ground in the semiconductor industry, since it’s become a long-term winner thanks to its planned acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). In fact, Ansys shareholders recently approved of the acquisition which clears another hurdle for Synopsys.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to lead the stock market higher with incredible earnings. Revenue increased by 262% YOY in Q1 of fiscal year 2025 while net income soared by 628% YOY!\n\nSequential revenue growth has been slowing down as Nvidia’s revenue only increased by 18% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ). However, the corporation should continue to report exceptional YOY results throughout fiscal 2025.\n\nAdditionally, net profit margins remain impressive and exceeded 50% in the quarter. High net profits prompted the company to raise its dividend by 150% this year. However, the dividend yield isn’t much. It’s easy to forget that Nvidia even gives out a dividend since its yield stands at 0.015%. Elevated profitability suggests that Nvidia can hold onto its valuation, even when growth inevitably slows down.\n\nFor now, the stock doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. It’s up by 116% YTD and has gained more than 2,700% over the past five years. With a $2.5 trillion market cap, Nvidia has a real shot at surpassing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO, SNPS, and NVDA.

        "title": "Why Nvidia stock isn't in a massive bubble",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTry to knock this king off the throne.\n\nIn the days since Nvidia's (NVDA) big quarter and outlook on Wednesday night, two tracks have emerged.\n\nTrack one is owned and operated by Wall Street, and it believes Nvidia will continue to speed to new profit heights this year and next. Consensus estimates (which can be tracked on Yahoo Finance here) are on the rise (again), and the Street remains steadfast in its appetite for jacked-up price targets.\n\nThe other track is owned and operated by the media, and it is increasingly looking to poke holes in the Nvidia investment thesis. Hey, I get it; it's our job to be skeptical of numbers, commonly held narratives, and leaders.\n\nBut to be out there peddling that Nvidia's stock is in a bubble because it's up a lot, or its financials may be in a bubble due to eye-popping growth rates, strike me as off base completely.\n\nLet me offer this up front: I have no car in this race — do not own shares of Nvidia and never have.\n\nAll I am saying is that an asset bubble has a few simple characteristics.\n\nOne: The asset appreciating in value usually doesn't have the fundamentals to justify said appreciation. Two: People are blindly buying the asset without understanding the asset — mainly because everyone else is going in.\n\nI don't see either of these things for Nvidia.\n\nInvestors appear very knowledgeable on Nvidia's business and are buying for the correct reasons.\n\nThen, Nvidia's growth rates justify a higher valuation. This is a company that just grew earnings by 461% in the first quarter! Sales exploded 262%!\n\nWhy? Because we are witnessing a seismic shift in tech stacks at the hand of generative AI, powered by models underpinned by Nvidia chips. No one is even close to this company's technology. Concerns over Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) building their own AI chips are great to discuss, but Nvidia is doing this at scale, and is 27 miles ahead of these companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang makes the keynote address at Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif. on March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Dan Howley in an exclusive interview right after earnings (video above). \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\n\nWill Nvidia keep growing its top and bottom lines by triple digits? No, but the growth rates will remain beyond impressive and faster than competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBubble? Let's get real here, people!\n\nAmazon AWS has begun to make AI chips to better control a supply chain starved for these powerful pieces of technology.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia, Buy This Magnificent Healthcare Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a great stock to own, and it could remain that way for long-term investors. However, the problem is that it's trading at nearly 40 times its future profits. At such a high valuation, it sets a high bar for the business and effectively prices in a lot of future growth already. It could make it difficult for the stock to continue to generate high returns. Even if it does, at such an inflated valuation, the risk of a potential sell-off is high if the business falls short of analyst and investor expectations.\n\nThere are arguably better opportunities out there for investors than just buying shares of Nvidia. There are magnificent stocks to buy in other industries, such as healthcare, which may provide investors with safer and better overall investment options. One stock that looks particularly attractive right now is AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV).\n\nWhy AbbVie's recent numbers may look a bit misleading\n\nAbbVie hasn't been nearly as hot a buy as Nvidia, and for good reason -- its growth rate has been underwhelming. During the first three months of the year, the company's revenue totaled $12.3 billion and was up less than 1% year over year.\n\nBut a big reason for AbbVie's underwhelming numbers is the loss of exclusivity of Humira, its top-selling drug. The rheumatoid arthritis drug's sales declined by nearly 36% during the period, falling to less than $2.3 billion. AbbVie was able to avoid an overall decline in the top line because of how well its new up-and-coming drugs have been performing. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are two immunology drugs AbbVie developed and commercialized to offset the revenue loss from Humira, and that strategy has been working. Together, the two drugs combined for $3.1 billion in revenue this past quarter, with Skyrizi growing at a rate of 48% while Rinvoq's sales rose by more than 59%.\n\nThe company possesses some promising growth potential\n\nAbbVie has also been investing in opportunities to enhance its growth prospects in the long run. Earlier this year, it closed on its $10 billion acquisition of ImmunoGen. The company makes antibody-drug conjugates, which target cancer cells more effectively without damaging healthy ones -- a common concern with chemotherapy. AbbVie also plans to buy Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion, in a move that would expand its neuroscience pipeline and bolster that area of its business.\n\nManagement is working on strengthening the business, with AbbVie CEO Richard A. Gonzalez believing that it may not be too long before investors start to see a payoff from the company's efforts. He's expecting \"a return to robust growth in 2025 and a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile that growth rate may still be a bit low for growth-oriented investors, don't forget that AbbVie accumulates plenty of free cash, which could pave the way for even more acquisitions and opportunities in the future. Over the past three years, AbbVie has generated over $68 billion in free cash flow.\n\nAbbVie's modest valuation could set investors up for strong gains\n\nYear to date, shares of AbbVie have climbed by just 5%. But despite the lackluster gains, the healthcare stock has the potential to make for a phenomenal long-term investment. Trading at just 15 times its estimated future profits and with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.4, the stock could prove to be a steal of a deal for long-term investors. In comparison, Nvidia's PEG ratio is around 1.3, suggesting that it may be a bit more overpriced in relation to its growth prospects.\n\nAnd without a skyrocketing valuation, investors can buy shares of AbbVie while also securing a fairly high dividend, which yields 3.8% right now. That's more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.4%.\n\nAbbVie is a great stock to buy and hold\n\nAlthough its recent results may not look all that impressive, there's reason to remain bullish on AbbVie in the long run. While you could wait for the business to generate better numbers, odds are that by then, the stock will be trading higher. Adding the stock to your portfolio before that happens can lead to much greater gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AbbVie wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Buying stocks can lead to more wealth. Your money will work for you and push you closer toward meaningful financial goals. However, you have to invest in the right stocks to increase your chances of success.\n\nCorporations with rising revenue and profit margins look promising. These companies also need to have competitive advantages and plenty of runway in addition to having strong financials. These three stocks to buy exhibit those characteristics and can bring your portfolio higher.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis stock has delivered generational wealth for its long-term investors. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up by more than 2,700% over the past five years and has more than doubled year-to-date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia’s Blackwell platform is leading the AI boom and has poised the company for the next wave of growth. The company’s innovative AI technology resulted in 262% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25. Profit margins also improved based on the firm’s 628% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nNvidia also stirred up excitement with its 10-for-1 stock split. While stock splits do not make a company more valuable, this stock split has a few benefits that can further push up the stock price. The first advantage is that a lower stock price can increase the likelihood of Nvidia getting added to the Dow Jones Index.\n\nThe second perk is that a lower price per share should stimulate options trading. Options can increase the volatility of the underlying asset and lead to more gains if the majority of options traders buy calls. Given Nvidia’s historical gains and strong financial performance, it’s likely that NVDA calls outpace its put options.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) delivered an exceptional earnings report as other beauty brands warned about slower sales growth. The company had its first fiscal year of more than $1 billion in net sales which was a 77% year-over-year increase. Q4 FY24 revenue was up by 71% year-over-year and came to $321.1 million. Net income was down by roughly 12 year-over-year and came to $14.5 million.\n\nElf Beauty’s guidance implies a net sales increase of 20% to 22% year-over-year in fiscal 2025. This lower guidance initially scared away investors, but Elf Beauty has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmarks and raising its full-year guidance. Elf Beauty raised its guidance in the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe cosmetics company forecasted a 22%-24% year-over-year revenue increase for fiscal 2024. Leadership has regularly issued modest guidance so it can easily beat and raise its benchmarks. That’s why shares rocketed up by 15% upon the earnings release. While guidance looks discouraging, Elf Beauty followed the same script in 2024. The company forecasted 22%-24% growth and ended up with 77% year-over-year net sales growth instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a top fast food restaurant that offers healthier choices than most of its competitors. This dynamic has allowed Chipotle to raise its prices multiple times without losing traction. While other fast food restaurants have lost demand due to price fatigue, Chipotle’s earnings report told a different story.\n\nQ1 2024 revenue increased for the Mexican restaurant chain by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion. Diluted EPS increased by 23.9% year-over-year to reach $13.01 per share.  Chipotle also opened 47 new restaurants and remains on track to open 285-315 new restaurants this year.\n\nChipotle has a long-term goal of more than doubling its domestic business and expanding internationally. Those ambitions combined with a quality experience suggest the stock can rally for several years. So far, Chipotle is living up to the hype. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date and have surged by 373% over the past five years. A recently announced stock split should spur additional demand for the stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA and ELF.

        "title": "Strap In for Gains: 7 High-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for May. These companies are on pace for rapid growth thanks to strong fundamentals and innovative business models that promise long-term gains for investors.\n\nGiven the rising S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which generally signal robust market conditions, investors should look for tech stocks that can capitalize on these trends. The three companies discussed in this article stand out due to their ability to overcome challenges and leverage broader market opportunities.\n\nTheir strengths, including accelerating revenue growth and profitability, indicate that they are well-positioned to thrive. Instead of sticking to a broad-based ETF, investors should consider these high-potential names, especially since I predict the AI boom will drive significant advancements in the tech sector for some time to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are seven high-octane tech stocks to buy for this month.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Coinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has benefited from the surge in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company’s return to profitability and the increasing popularity of crypto transactions position it well for future growth.\r\n\r\nCoinbase’s stock price increased by approximately 300%, underscoring its strong position in the digital asset market. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs supports this growth.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Coinbase reported significant financial improvements with revenue reaching $1.64 billion, up 122% from the same period in 2023, and a net income of $1.18 billion, a stark contrast to the loss reported in the previous year.\r\n\r\nCoinbase’s future outlook remains optimistic. The company forecasts continued institutional investment in Bitcoin and anticipates favorable macroeconomic conditions and regulatory advancements, which are expected to support long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\nCOIN is one of my top picks for this year and I think we’ve only started to see the potential of the company.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has demonstrated impressive growth, particularly with a 25% year-over-year (YOY) increase in Q4 revenue, reaching $40.11 billion. The company is focusing on efficiency, scaling back costs, and enhancing AI technologies.\n\nThis strong performance is attributed to a positive shift in ad pricing growth and robust online commerce advertising. The increase in ad pricing marks a return to growth for the first time since Q4 2021, bolstered by significant contributions from China-based advertisers.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to invest $30-37 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, primarily in AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers. This investment is aimed at supporting its long-term AI research and product development efforts. This growth is supported by the successful implementation of cost management strategies and increased monetization efforts through features like Reels and WhatsApp Channels​.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA could be one of those undervalued picks in the stock market for aggressive investors, which is why I recommend it as one to watch.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Qualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plays a critical role in the expansion of 5G networks and mobile technology. Despite a recent slowdown in mobile phone sales, the company’s strong position in the 5G market and a robust dividend yield make it an attractive long-term investment​.\r\n\r\nIn the second fiscal quarter of 2024, Qualcomm reported strong financial results, with revenues reaching $9.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.44, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was driven by increased sales in handset and automotive chips. Despite a slight decline in gross margins, the company’s financial performance remains solid.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, Qualcomm has set ambitious growth targets. The company expects its QCT segment to achieve mid-teens compound annual growth rates (CAGR) and maintain operating margins above 30% by fiscal 2024. Additionally, Qualcomm projects automotive revenues to grow to approximately $3.5 billion in five years and $8 billion in ten years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to gain market share in the semiconductor industry with strong performance in its Data Center and Client segments. In the first quarter of 2024, AMD reported revenue of $5.5 billion, marking a 2% YOY increase. The company also achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 52% and a net income of $123 million.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, AMD has set an optimistic outlook for 2024, expecting revenue to reach approximately $5.7 billion in the second quarter, representing a 6% YOY growth. This positive projection is driven by increased demand for its high-performance computing products.\n\nThe company’s focus on edge AI with its Ryzen line positions it well to dominate in this emerging market. CEO Lisa Su has projected the AI accelerator market to reach $400 billion by 2027, nearly 300% growth from this year.\r\n\r\nAMD is a great alternative to the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), as it has a far lower valuation than the microchip giant.\n\nHigh-Octane Tech Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) remains a leader in e-commerce platforms, with significant revenue growth and recent profitability.\r\n\r\nIn Q4 2023, Shopify reported a 24% increase in revenue, reaching $2.1 billion. The company also achieved a free cash flow of $905 million, compared to a negative free cash flow of $186 million the previous year. This marked a significant turnaround.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Shopify projects revenue growth at a low-twenties percentage rate on a YOY basis. This translates into a mid-to-high-twenties growth rate when adjusted for the impact of selling its logistics businesses. Gross margin for Q1 is on track to increase by approximately 150 basis points compared to Q4 2023.\n\nSHOP is one of my favorite picks for investors seeking one of those high-octane tech stocks for gains. Despite these positive indicators, Shopify’s stock experienced a decline due to lower-than-expected free cash flow guidance for 2024. I still think that long-term SHOP should be on investors’ radars.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoupang (NYSE:CPNG) is expanding into new verticals like travel and dining. Despite a significant drop from its IPO price, analysts forecast strong earnings and revenue growth, with a projected stock price target averaging $26.67, suggesting a potential upside of 19.2% from the current price.\r\n\r\nCoupang’s diversified services include Rocket Fresh for grocery delivery, Coupang Eats for restaurant ordering and delivery, and Coupang Play for online content streaming. These offerings have significantly boosted customer engagement, supported by over 100 fulfillment centers across South Korea.\n\nFinancially, Coupang has consistently reported positive cash flows. In the last four quarters, the company achieved an operating cash flow of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. This positive financial performance is further highlighted by a 27% YOY increase in gross profits to $1.6 billion.\n\nCPNG could be a good pick for investors who want to diversify their portfolios outside of the United States, as CPNG is essentially the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of South Korea.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), a Chinese EV manufacturer, has shown impressive growth, with revenue increasing by 271% last quarter. It outsold Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in China for October 2023, and its hybrid EVs are gaining significant market share in China. The company delivered 80,400 vehicles in Q1 2024.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company is advancing its autonomous driving technology, with plans to roll out AD Max 3.0, featuring full-scenario autonomous driving capabilities and enhanced safety systems.\n\nFinancially, Li Auto has consistently reported positive cash flows, with Q3 2023 showing a free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The company also achieved a gross profit margin of 25.3% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.9%.\n\nChinese-brand EVs like Li will likely continue to perform strongly, even despite Biden’s recent tariffs on these companies. Asia is fast becoming the hotspot for the market, and I feel that this will continue to grow in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) boom has continued to pick up speed, with GPU firm Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) once again leading the way. The company’s latest quarterly blowout sent shares soaring nearly 10% while the rest of the market sunk lower. Undoubtedly, there’s still plenty of gas in the AI engine, even if the market is starting to lose a bit of steam after a robust springtime rally.\n\nNot all companies have been able to gain traction on the back of AI tailwinds, however. Even the companies spending time and money to bolster their footing in AI may have seen little upside action in their share prices, at least so far.\n\nIt can be tempting to dismiss such tech firms as “being left behind in the AI boom.” That said, I view the biggest gains from such AI bets as coming in gradually over the next six years and beyond. You see, AI won’t be an overnight shot in the arm for every firm.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMany companies playing the long game with AI will be rewarded in due time. For investors with long enough time horizons, I believe the following lagging tech stocks will be well worth the wait.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech juggernaut that comes to mind when one thinks of firms that haven’t really taken off at the hands of an AI boom. In my opinion, Apple may be playing possum when it comes to its AI capabilities.\n\nIn a recent sit-down with CNBC, Steve Eisman, the investment legend behind The Big Short, referred to Apple as a “hidden AI play.” He thinks once the AI apps arrive, consumers will buy AI devices, perhaps kicking off the start of an AI-driven refresh cycle. That’s some bullish commentary from one of the smartest investors out there. And I think he’ll be proven right about AAPL stock over the next 18 months.\n\nBuild the AI apps, and they will come.\n\nAlso, the new Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot+ PCs represent a potential competitive threat to the Mac if Apple can’t make the most of its powerful M4 chip from an application standpoint. The M4 neural engine is powerful, but it also needs to be more useful for a wider range of applications.\n\nThough I’m not entirely sure if AI PCs will be in high demand this year, next year or sometime later, I think it’s safe to say that Apple will eventually be ready to make a huge splash in AI. Either way, the Apple AI rumor mill has been rotating at increasing speed lately.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is a data warehousing company that’s remarkably pivoted towards generative AI in recent quarters. With Sridhar Ramaswamy, a new face running the business, and a number of small but smart moves made to bolster Snowflake’s AI software suite, it’s clear Snowflake is serious about harnessing AI to power growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith strong strategic partnerships with some of the world’s AI leaders (like Nvidia and Mistral AI) and a growing appetite for bite-sized AI startup acquisitions, I view SNOW stock as one of the lesser-appreciated AI companies that could enjoy AI-related upside gradually over the next five years.\n\nSnowflake’s recent $1 billion pursuit of Reka AI has fallen through, but look for the firm to spend the money elsewhere as it looks to wheel and deal on AI. The way I see it, SNOW stock is a bargain after falling over 5% after some impressive quarterly results. It won’t stay grounded in the AI race forever.\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another tech titan whose AI innovations may be vastly overlooked. Today, CSCO stock is down over 26% from its 2021 highs, and the negative momentum seems to be picking up speed, even after the firm reported quarterly sales that weren’t nearly as bad as they could have been. The guidance wasn’t bad either, but it seems like investors have had enough of the network equipment maker and the relative lack of timely AI catalysts.\n\nLike it or not, Cisco has been improving its slate of products with AI. With a useful AI assistant brought to the Webex suite and its Security Operations Center (SOC), Cisco seems to be following in the footsteps of many other firms by enhancing existing offerings with AI.\n\nIn the meantime, investors seem less impressed with the AI additions, but I expect such efforts will translate to growth eventually. At 15.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), CSCO stock is quite cheap (and bountiful with a 3.43% dividend yield) for a “hidden” AI play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Snowflake.

        "title": "My Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Another quarter, another report of jaw-dropping sales. That's been a recurring story with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nDoes this make Nvidia the best AI stock to buy right now? I don't think so. My favorite AI stock could give investors a better chance of making even more money over the next few years.\n\nA perhaps surprising choice\n\nYou might think I would pick one of the mega-cap cloud providers -- Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, or perhaps even Oracle. AI should provide a massive tailwind for years to come for all of them. I like all of these stocks, but none of them is my current AI favorite.\n\nInstead, my choice is perhaps surprising. It's UiPath(NYSE: PATH). While all of the aforementioned stocks are performing well so far in 2024, UiPath's shares have fallen more than 20%.\n\nMany investors may be unfamiliar with UiPath. The company has been in business since 2005, but it has only traded publicly since April 2021. UiPath develops software used in automating business processes. It started out focusing on robotic process automation (RPA) and now has an end-to-end AI-powered business automation platform.\n\nUiPath is a molehill to Nvidia's mountain. Its market cap is only around $10.8 billion. The company generated revenue of $1.3 billion in its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2024. That's practically pocket change for Nvidia, which raked in 20 times that amount in the first quarter alone.\n\nWhat I like about UiPath\n\nSo why is UiPath my favorite AI stock to buy right now? There are several reasons. Its small size is definitely a plus in my view. It could be tough for Nvidia to deliver another 10x return because it's already so huge. UiPath, though, might be in a better position to pull off such an impressive gain.\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Invest projects the AI software market could expand by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% and reach $14 trillion by 2030. Granted, this number includes more than just the AI business automation software that UiPath markets. However, it underscores the massive opportunity the company could have.\n\nUiPath's growth is already impressive. The company's revenue jumped 31% year over year in its latest quarter, hitting an all-time high. Its annualized revenue run rate has increased by a CAGR of 32% since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nI like that UiPath only recently achieved profitability as a publicly traded company. Investing in companies at this stage can be highly rewarding as they scale up. Just look at the history of Nvidia, Alphabet, and others.\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation is a key factor, too. UiPath's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is only 0.93. That's well below Nvidia's PEG ratio of 1.25 and is also lower than the multiples for Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nUiPath has some potential drawbacks. For example, while I view its newfound profitability as an encouraging inflection point, the company could return to posting losses if its spending grows too much.\n\nPerhaps the biggest risk for UiPath is the fast pace of technological change. The company faces stiff competition in attracting top-tier talent. UiPath could be out-innovated. It would be especially concerning if a major player such as Alphabet or Amazon entered the AI business automation platform market.\n\nI think, though, that UiPath has a clear path to success if it executes well. The company might never be a $2.5 trillion behemoth like Nvidia, but it could be the better stock to own over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UiPath wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Technology stocks have outperformed the broader market handsomely over the last decade -- illustrated by the fact that the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index clocked a gain of 421% over the period compared to the S&P 500 index's 178% rise. The outperformance isn't surprising. Tech companies tend to benefit from disruptive trends, which allows them to deliver outsized growth.\n\nThe top tech stocks, such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), have far outpaced even the Nasdaq-100's performance in that timespan, giving long-term investors' portfolios a big boost. NVDA Chart\n\nTo be fair, it would be difficult for Nvidia and Amazon -- now two of the world's largest companies -- to replicate such terrific 10-year gains over the next decade. However, buying these two tech giants and holding on to them as a part of a diversified portfolio has a great chance of being a smart long-term move. Both companies still sit on tremendous growth opportunities in multiple markets, which is why they could become ideal picks for investors looking to grow a million-dollar portfolio.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia has come a long way. Two decades ago, it largely sold graphics processing units (GPUs) for use in gaming personal computers (PCs) and workstations, but today, its hardware (and software) is powering computationally intensive applications in data centers, advanced driver-assistance systems, factories, and digital twin creation, among other areas. Artificial intelligence (AI), however, is currently the biggest catalyst for the company.\n\nNvidia's revenue and earnings grew at a breathtaking pace in recent quarters as customers lined up to get their hands on its AI chips. The company reportedly holds an impressive 92% share of the burgeoning AI chip market, and that dominant presence is expected to keep giving its growth massive shots in the arm: The AI chip market is expected to generate $305 billion in global revenue by 2030 (up from $29 billion in 2022).\n\nNvidia's data center business generated $47.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year; assuming it remains the biggest player in this market at the end of the decade, that figure could be much higher for 2030. This, however, is not the only AI-related opportunity that Nvidia is set to capitalize on.\n\nDemand for PCs capable of running AI software locally is set to increase at an annualized rate of 44% through 2028, according to market research firm Canalys. That impressive growth would ideally lead to stronger demand for the Nvidia GPUs that are deployed in laptops and desktops. As a result, it won't be surprising to see the company's gaming business taking off in the coming years and complementing its data center growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia is gaining traction in the digital twin market. The company's GPUs are being deployed to power the creation of 3D virtual representations of factories before those factories are actually constructed. These digital twins allow organizations to optimize their operations, look for problems, and improve efficiency before the physical factories are built. Such virtual spaces are also useful for a host of purposes after a real-world location is complete.\n\nDemand for digital twins is expected to grow at an annual rate of 41% through 2035, generating annual revenue of $240 billion at the end of the forecast period.\n\nIn all, Nvidia management projects that it is sitting on an addressable market worth a whopping $1 trillion. If that's indeed the case, the company is at the beginning of a terrific growth curve considering that it generated just under $61 billion in revenue last year.\n\nWith numerous lucrative growth opportunities and catalysts, it should keep growing at a nice pace for quite some time. That's why investors looking for tech stocks that could help them grow their portfolios to the million-dollar level should consider buying Nvidia.\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon has benefited from the secular growth of the e-commerce market over the years, and it should continue to capitalize on this segment's growth in the future. According to a forecast by Exactitude Consultancy, the global e-commerce market will clock a compound annual growth rate of 15% through 2030, generating just over $20 trillion in annual revenue at the end of that period.\n\nAmazon is in a solid position to capitalize on this huge growth opportunity as it is the leading e-commerce player in key markets including the U.S., where it has a market share of nearly 40%, a number that has slowly crept higher over the years. However, e-commerce is not the only big growth driver that Amazon is set to make the most of.\n\nThe company is the largest player in the cloud infrastructure services market, with a share of 31% in the first quarter of 2024. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division, reported healthy year-over-year growth of 17% in Q1 and generated $25 billion in revenue. That was higher than the 13% growth in Amazon's overall revenue last quarter to $143.3 billion.\n\nGrowing demand for cloud-based AI services should give AWS a big boost in the long run. Mordor Intelligence estimates that the cloud AI market could generate $274 billion in annual revenue in 2029 as compared to this year's estimate of $67 billion. Amazon's robust share in the cloud computing market and the growing adoption of AI-focused services on AWS suggests that the company is well placed to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nThe growth drivers discussed above tell us why analysts are expecting Amazon's annualized earnings growth to accelerate to 30% for the next five years from 14% in the past five. The company's improved earnings power could lead the market to reward the tech stock over the long run, making it an ideal pick for investors looking to add potential millionaire-maker stocks to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying Up This Stock Instead",
        "content": "Taking profits in chip giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was a popular move among billionaire hedge fund managers in the first quarter, with a number of notable ones reducing their stakes in the company. Given the run the stock has had, it perhaps should be of little surprise that some big-name investors were taking some profits.\n\nAmong the billionaires reducing their stakes in Nvidia were Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Capital Management, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investments, and Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management.\n\nDruckenmiller talked about his reason for reducing his stake in Nvidia, saying in a CNBC interview that he still liked Nvidia but that artificial intelligence (AI) might be overhyped in the near term. However, he said the big payoff could be big in four to five years and that AI may be underhyped in the long term.\n\nWhile it's common to see billionaire hedge fund managers taking some profits in a stock like Nvidia, several top hedge fund managers are also piling into Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Among the investors aggressively buying the stock in Q1 were Chase Coleman of Tiger Global, Glen Kacher of Light Street Capital, Gavin Baker of Atreides Management, and Foxhaven Asset Management's Michael Pausic and Nick Lawler.\n\nLet's look at why these investors might think Alphabet is an attractive investment.\n\nAlphabet is drawing investor interest\n\nOne of the first things that tends to grab hedge fund managers' attention is valuation. Alphabet trades at a pretty large discount compared to many other AI-related stocks with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 23.6 times. A number of rivals are trading at over 35 times. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIn addition, that is below the multiple where Alphabet has traded historically before the pandemic when it would often trade above a 30 times P/E ratio. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nThat gives Alphabet stock room to run higher, but valuation alone is not a reason that well-regarded hedge fund managers would buy the stock.\n\nAn investment in Alphabet is an investment in a company that has two dominant businesses with Google search and video platform YouTube. Google is nearly a monopoly with about an estimated 90% share in global search. While there have been some fears of AI impacting its search business, the company is embracing the technology, rolling out AI overlays at the top of page results to answer more complex questions.\n\nAlphabet will look toward new ad formats to help monetize its latest AI efforts to drive growth. With only about 20% of its search results including ads, this is actually a pretty large opportunity for Google search to become even more profitable in the future by monetizing the search results it doesn't make money from currently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's YouTube platform should also not be overlooked. While many streaming services outside of Netflix have struggled with profitably due to content costs, the revenue-sharing model that Alphabet uses with creators has long alleviated these issues. Meanwhile, the company has a strong opportunity to profit from short-form videos that compete with TikTok, which it has just started to monetize. If its competitor gets banned in the U.S., this could be a big opportunity for the company.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet's cloud computing business is still in the early days of ramping up profitability. Given the high fixed costs of the business, profitability should now grow much faster than revenue, which will be driven by AI adoption. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nShould retail investors follow suit and buy Alphabet?\n\nAlphabet is a relatively inexpensive stock with a dominant position in search and a big opportunity ahead of it with AI. While the stock has had a strong year, up about 27% year to date, it is not too late to follow hedge fund billionaires into the stock.\n\nThe company has a long runway of growth ahead and multiple expansion potential (which is an increase in its valuation multiples, such as P/E). Together that is a powerful combination and makes the stock a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Street calls of the week: Upgrades for Micron, Magnite and GoodRx Holdings",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week: upgrades for Micron, Magnite and GoodRx Holdings; downgrade for Him Hers Health.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving rating changes.\n\nMicron\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Morgan Stanley upgraded Micron (NASDAQ:MU) to Equalweight with a $130 price target\n\nWhat’s the full story? Morgan Stanley acknowledges that maintaining a negative stance on Micron for an extended period was a misstep. While they are not yet optimistic, they concede that they should have anticipated the fundamental and narrative implications of the strength in AI specialty memory.\n\nThree key errors were made by the research team according to their research report. First, they placed too much emphasis on recent losses. When they initially became pessimistic about MU two years ago, they predicted significant cash burn, financial losses, and a substantial erosion of book value. When losses turned out to be quite large - $7.1 billion of GAAP over a five-quarter downturn leading to a 14% reduction in book value - they expected this to have a greater impact on valuation than it did.\n\nSecond, Morgan Stanley underestimated the significance of High Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND) Memory (HBM) to the narrative. HBM has emerged as a critical technology for AI, and while Micron is just now beginning to reap the benefits of this, having missed the HBM3 phase of the market, they have a robust 3e product that will firmly place them in second place. This was known six months ago, and despite some concerns that current wafer commitments are too high, this still propelled Micron directly into the winners’ camp during a phase when proximity to AI drove most of the alpha generation in the space.\n\nThird, the bank wrote they underestimated the importance of HBM in turning around the base business. While they believe their Total Addressable Market (TAM) analysis of HBM remains reasonable, they are now seeing Trendforce project 15% of wafer starts going to HBM by 4Q24, and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) suggesting they are already at 20%. This is too high, at least relative to the consumption suggested by even the NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) bull case, but the impact on non-HBM is having more of a negative impact on industry supply than they had anticipated.\n\nWith these factors driving near-term fundamentals - they could see a positive preannouncement in upcoming conferences - and a positive view on AI semis, Morgan Stanley is moving to Equalweight on MU\n\nEqualweight at Morgan Stanley means “The stock's total return is expected to be in line with the average total return of the analyst's industry (or industry team's) coverage universe, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 12-18 months. “\n\nStory continues\n\nHow did the stock react? Micron opened the regular session at $127.30 and closed at $129.00, a gain of 2.96% from the prior day regular close.\n\nPenn Entertainment\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday (actually Monday after-hours), Raymond James started new coverage on PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) at Outperform with a $20 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? The first quarter of this year presented a challenging environment for PENN, characterized by several factors. These include weakness in the land-based business, primarily influenced by weather conditions, higher-than-expected losses in the digital sector, and a significant selloff due to management-related issues.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the core land-based gaming business remains relatively robust. In 2023, PENN achieved record revenue and EBITDAR (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent) levels. Furthermore, there is an anticipated improvement in EBITDAR throughout 2024. However, it’s important to note that the stock’s performance continues to be impacted by the company’s interactive business, which has accumulated significant EBITDA losses.\n\nRaymond James’ positive stance on PENN’s stock is not solely based on the belief that ESPN BET (the interactive business) will capture a significant market share or generate positive EBITDA in the near term. Instead, the brokerage recognizes that PENN stock can still perform well to a certain extent. Specifically, Raymond James believes that the market is undervaluing the digital business, attributing negative equity value to it. Additionally, the fair value for the land-based business is estimated to be north of $20 per share.\n\nIt’s worth noting that PENN shares have not traded at this price level since May 2020, a period when all casinos in the United States were closed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges posed by PENN’s interactive strategy and an over-leveraged balance sheet, Raymond James identifies value in the land-based operations. The brokerage contends that current market conditions may not fully reflect this underlying value.\n\nOutperform at Raymond James means “The security is expected to appreciate or outperform the S&P 500 over the next 12-18 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Penn Entertainment opened the regular session at $16.39 and closed at $16.41 a gain of 0.86% from the prior day regular close.\n\nHim Hers Health\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Citi downgraded Hims Hers Health Inc (NYSE:HIMS) to Neutral with a $20 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Citi has expressed encouragement by HIMS’ thoughtful approach to their new program, which was initially a cause for concern due to potential regulatory and legal risks. The bank is convinced that HIMS is operating above-board, partnering with a large 340B manufacturer that is directly producing Semaglutide, using API, processes, and expedients very similar to Novo. According to management, the production of Semaglutide is relatively straightforward, and HIMS’ manufacturing partner should be able to produce enough product to meet what is expected to be significant demand, as there seems to be no shortage of API.\n\nHowever, with the stock up 20% since the announcement, HIMS has effectively added approximately $760M of enterprise value on limited new information, leaving little room for upside, in Citi’s view. As a result, the bank is downgrading HIMS from Buy/High Risk to Neutral/High Risk as they await further detail on GLP-1 economics and durability. Despite the downgrade, Citi remains attentive to HIMS’ future moves and potential in the market.\n\nNeutral at Citi means “For stocks rated Neutral (2), if an analyst believes that there are insufficient valuation drivers and/or investment catalysts to derive a positive or negative investment view, they may elect with the approval of Citi Research management not to assign a target price and, thus, not derive an ETR.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Hims & Hims Health opened the regular session at $16.90 and closed at $16.17, a lost of 7.84% from the prior day regular close.\n\nGoodRx Holdings\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, RBC Capital upgraded Goodrx Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:GDRX) to Outperform with a $10 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? GDRX’s recent ISP and DC initiatives, along with the continued scaling of its MfgSolns business, provide it with several new and meaningful growth opportunities. These initiatives also enhance the durability of its core Rx transaction business. Much of the required upfront selling/contracting is now complete—GDRX has signed five PBMs and seven top-10 pharmacies. The ramping of these provides GDRX with a good line-of-sight on a 3-year mid-teens+ EBITDA CAGR.\n\nRBC Capital believes that execution here will help re-rate GDRX’s current 10x '25 EBITDA valuation to something more in line with its growth rate and 14x peer average. The analysts have raised the price target to $10, up from $8.\n\nOutperform at RBC Capital means “Expected to materially outperform sector average over 12 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? GoodRx Holdings opened the regular session at $7.74 and closed at $7.24, a gain of 0.56% from the prior day regular close.\n\nMagnite Inc.\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, BofA Securities upgraded Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI) to Buy with a $15 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? RBC’s upgrade of MGNI is bolstered by the firm’s heightened assurance in MGNI’s trajectory to ascend as the premier supply-side technology solution in CTV advertising—a sector anticipated to grow at a mid-teens rate over the medium term. This optimism is rooted in the industry’s shift toward more automated, or programmatic, ad execution—a niche where MGNI excels. The company is increasingly recognized as the preferred ad tech collaborator for both buy-side entities, such as agencies and DSPs, and sell-side participants like publishers. This is largely due to its leading-edge programmatic technology, which has been underscored by its recent exclusive partnerships with industry giants Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and MediaOcean.\n\nThe analysts highlight MGNI’s unique product mix that marries an ad server with an SSP, establishing it as a pivotal hub for publishers’ programmatic frameworks regardless of the purchasing pathway. This integration renders MGNI significantly less susceptible to disintermediation compared to standalone SSPs. Furthermore, insights from Disney and Paramount indicate that the move toward programmatic methods is progressing swiftly, with projections of reaching approximately 50% by the end of 2024 within premium streaming services. This trend underpins a narrative of sustained market share growth for MGNI, as viewed by the analysts at RBC Capital.\n\nBuy at BofA means “Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Magnite opened the regular session at $12.03 and closed at $12.57, a gain of 13.55% from the prior day regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Upgrades for Micron, Magnite and GoodRx Holdings\n\nAircraft hit by severe turbulence returns to Singapore, local media reports\n\nTesla shareholders advised to reject Musk's $56 billion pay\n\nView comments",

Upgrade today!\n\niPhone ‘turning the corner with AI-driven supercycle’ - Wedbush\n\nWedbush analysts said recent Asia supply chain checks indicate stabilization for Apple’s iPhone, which has been grappling with a slowdown in sales for months.\n\nIn their note, the investment firm raised its price target for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock from $250 to $275, noting that the stabilization is a very positive sign as the company approaches a significant iPhone 16 upgrade cycle.\n\nSpecifically, iPhone demand is \"turning the corner into an AI-driven iPhone 16 supercycle,\" which is now on the horizon, wrote Wedbush.\n\n\"We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring ample monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share to the Cupertino growth story as the vision starts to play out within the golden installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices.\"\n\nWedbush said its recent checks in Taiwan imply that April results for Apple's supply chain were 2% ahead of historical linearity, while consensus remained unchanged.\n\n\"Outperforming during April was perhaps helped by inventory build ahead of China's holidays in May and June, though analysts have also seen a slight lift in Chinese handset build projections for the June quarter,\" says the firm.\n\nWedbush also expects Apple to lay the foundation for an AI App Store at the WWDC event in June, leading to significant Services growth over the coming years.\n\nMicrosoft to shape wider GenAI adoption - Goldman Sachs\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to lead in democratizing Gen-AI adoption, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note this week, commending the company’s innovations across the tech stack following the Build event.\n\nGoldman highlighted that Microsoft’s extensive offerings for both businesses and consumers position the company “to define how AI evolves into a more broadly used technology.”\n\nOver the last 18 months, Microsoft has expanded its early innovations, putting a greater emphasis on cost efficiency from infrastructure to applications and hardware.\n\nAnalysts believe that the Windows maker is laying the foundational components to ensure the long-term relevance of new technologies.\n\n“For this reason, the company’s announcements - from Copilot extensions, to the distillment of foundation models and AI-enabled PCs - we expect Microsoft to be able to sustain its first-mover advantage to continue to be a dominant player in the age of Gen-AI,” analysts wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley upgrades Micron stock, says staying negative was ‘a mistake’\n\nIn a note to clients released Monday, analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their rating on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) shares, hinting that the memory chipmaker could issue “a positive preannouncement” this quarter.\n\nThe Wall Street firm upgraded MU stock from Underweight to Equal Weight, acknowledging that they had overestimated the impact of significant losses in 2023 on the company's valuation and underestimated the economic and narrative aspects of AI memory.\n\n“Remaining negative for too long on MU was a mistake. We still are not positive, but we should have foreseen the fundamental and narrative implications of the strength in AI specialty memory,” analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts also raised their 12-month target price for the stock from $98 to $130.\n\n“We still see MU as fundamentally overvalued on long term DCF metrics But HBM continues to drive sentiment from memory buyers, leading to sustained pricing strength; could see positive preannouncement this quarter HBM supply may prove excessive in the end but we are still in ramp phase.”\n\nNvidia has ANET in its sights with its AI-optimized Ethernet solution - Rosenblatt\n\nLast month, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities downgraded shares of Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) to Sell, voicing concerns that Nvidia would emerge as a key Ethernet competitor to the networking company.\n\nAlthough Arista recently said it still does not view NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a direct threat, analysts at Rosenblatt believe that the AI chipmaker has established itself as a significant Ethernet player during its latest earnings call.\n\n“Nvidia began shipping Spectrum X Ethernet Networking in 1Q25. The solution is optimized for AI and, like Infiniband, is designed for the network to be a key part of the AI compute fabric,” analysts wrote.\n\n“This is fundamentally different from what networks have been asked to do in the past, likely providing Nvidia with performance and competitive advantages over network-centric Ethernet players like ANET and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),” they added.\n\nMoreover, Rosenblatt said that Spectrum-X, Nvidia’s advanced networking platform designed to enhance data center performance for AI workloads, continues to gain traction with multiple customers, including a 100,000 GPU cluster.\n\nThe investment firm anticipates that this platform will evolve into a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\n\nAI PC war seen as positive for ARM, says BofA\n\nBank of America this week discussed the implications of the AI PC war on chipmakers, pointing out potential positive outcomes for some companies.\n\nTo be specific, the bank’s analysts see benefits for Arm Holdings ADR (NASDAQ:ARM), while the implications are neutral for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThey explained that combining new ARM-based CPUs with greater power efficiency and high NPU TOPS count, along with new Windows software specifically optimized for ARM, Microsoft claims their new Copilot+ PCs are 58% faster than the current ARM-based MacBook Air and significantly more power efficient than Intel and AMD-based PCs.\n\n\"While next iterations of Intel/AMD processors should catch up in AI/NPU performance, we flag increased competition for PC CPUs overall, with Arm expected to take share (12% unit share in CY26E vs. just 2% in CY20) from x86 incumbents INTC/AMD,\" analysts wrote.\n\n\"Still, we expect AI PCs to carry ~10% ASP upliſt, or 20% upliſt for core component (like CPUs) vendors, offsetting some of the share loss.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: iPhone demand at a turning point amid AI-driven supercycle\n\nAircraft hit by severe turbulence returns to Singapore, local media reports\n\nTesla shareholders advised to reject Musk's $56 billion pay\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Just Announced a Stock Split. Time to Buy?",
        "content": "For the past several months, investors have been wondering if Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would launch a stock split. That's after the technology giant's stock soared in recent years, reaching nearly $1,000. And it actually did reach $1,000 this week in the trading session following Nvidia's earnings report and announcement of a stock split. After the split, the chip designer's shares will be trading at a much lower level.\n\nBut this move won't change Nvidia's $2.3 trillion market value. Instead, a stock split involves issuing more shares to current shareholders and this will result in more shares trading at a lower price; current shareholders will end up with the same dollar value of stock as they had before the split. The drop in price will make the stock accessible to a broader range of investors, and Nvidia even said as part of its announcement that this was its motivation for making the move.\n\nSo, today, as Nvidia takes the step many investors were waiting for, is it time to buy the shares? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy are investors interested in stock splits?\n\nIt's important to note that it's not a good idea to buy a stock just because the company launched a split -- it's simply a mechanical operation. A stock split itself won't push a stock's value higher or lower. So now you might ask, if that's the case, why are investors so interested in whether a company will split its stock?\n\nIn many cases, the move suggests a company is optimistic about its future and believes that its shares have what it takes to take off once again. Generally, the company has performed well from an earnings perspective in recent years, and this has prompted the stock price gains we've already seen. Now, by splitting its shares, a company is implying that those gains aren't over, and from the stock's lower price it once again may soar and even eventually return to its pre-split level.\n\nNow let's consider the Nvidia operation, a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7. This means that if you hold one Nvidia share today, post-split you'll own 10, but the value of your holding will remain the same. And if you buy shares of Nvidia after the split, if they're still trading at $1,000 before the split, they'd drop to $100 per share after the split.\n\nThis maneuver will make it easier for investors who don't have access to fractional shares or those who prefer buying full shares to invest. And the $1,000 mark represents a psychological barrier for some investors, who would automatically hesitate to buy even if valuation is reasonable. Nvidia's stock split will remove this roadblock and pave the way for them to get in on this tech giant.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's five stock splits\n\nNvidia is no stranger to stock splits, having completed five in the past 24 years. And each time Nvidia announced a split, the stock price was considerably lower than it is today, so I'm not too surprised that Nvidia decided on this move right now.\n\nLet's get back to our question: Is it time to buy the shares? It is -- but not because of Nvidia's upcoming stock split. Nvidia's shares have climbed after its past stock splits, but this movement is due to the company's increasing revenue and demand for its products. NVDA Chart\n\nAnd a look at Nvidia's recent earnings report and the general AI market offer us reason to be optimistic about the future. The company reported triple-digit growth in revenue and net income in the fiscal 2025 first quarter, with revenue reaching record levels. At the same time, gross margin is on the rise, widening to more than 78%, so Nvidia is becoming more and more profitable.\n\nThe company says demand for its products and services is surpassing supply, and as Nvidia prepares to launch its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever, it's easy to imagine demand remaining strong. Especially considering AI market forecasts. Analysts predict the market will reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. All of this supports the idea of more growth ahead for Nvidia.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia shares trade for about 34 times forward earnings estimates, which looks very reasonable considering long-term prospects. That makes Nvidia a buy -- whether you make the move before or after the stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "ELF, TPR, TJX: Which “Strong Buy” Retail Stock Is the Better Bet?",
        "content": "The consumer seems to be behaving in mysterious ways lately. With inflation coming back down and purse tightening still in effect, in some places more than others, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get an accurate read of the consumer. They choose to splurge on certain luxuries, conveniences, and experiences but not at the grocery aisle. Given these dynamics, in this piece, we’ll check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to see how three Strong-Buy-rated discretionary retailers — ELF, TRP, and TJX — stack up over the year ahead.\n\nAs inflation touches down, with the odd price cuts potentially in the cards for certain items, I find that the consumer stands to get a lot healthier from here. As they spend more on specific discretionary goods, we may be getting a hint of where consumers are headed next.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NASDAQ:ELF)\n\nShares of cosmetics retailer e.l.f. Beauty shot up nearly 19% on Thursday, leaving the rest of the market in the dust as it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that were much better than expected. Indeed, the opportunity to grab ELF stock on the dip may have come and gone. The good news is that the disruptive cosmetics company is still down 14% from its all-time high of $221.83 per share.\n\nWith so much brand momentum and appeal with younger consumers, I expect more outperformance ahead as e.l.f. Beauty looks to grab more market share to fuel its growth. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on the stock, even after its remarkable post-quarter pop.\n\nFor Fiscal Q4 2024, e.l.f. saw revenue soar 77% year-over-year. Such scorching growth also accompanied a 140 bps improvement in EBITDA margins. Undoubtedly, the magnitude of sales growth and margin gains is simply not sustainable. That said, the boom could easily last for a while longer and help power shares to greater heights. In a way, e.l.f. seems to be like the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) of the beauty industry.\n\nAs the $10.7 billion disruptive cosmetics industry newcomer looks to replicate success in international markets (think Canada and the UK), there may still be room to extend the run. Nonetheless, expectations are bound to adjust to the downside after the firm called for slower growth for the rest of its fiscal year.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of ELF Stock?\n\nELF stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average ELF stock price target of $203.64 implies 6.4% upside potential.\n\nTapestry (NYSE:TPR)\n\nTapestry is the house behind such “accessible” luxury brands as Coach and Kate Spade. These are goods, like leather bags and wallets that are classy and upscale but not wildly expensive as the likes of a Dior or a Chanel. The stock has been on a wild ride over the past year, crashing and blasting off in a matter of months. Such volatility could persist for some time as Tapestry looks to acquire its way to greater growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough the medium-term could see more steep swings, I must say I like the longer-term trajectory, even after news broke that the Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) acquisition (Tapestry is trying to acquire Capri, another luxury retail company) is being blocked by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nSure, a Capri deal would have further solidified Tapestry’s moat, with new brands such as Versace and Jimmy Choo joining the mix. Regardless, Tapestry still has plenty of places where it can put the extra cash if no deal happens. Perhaps trimming away at debt and buying back shares while they’re relatively cheap could prove wise if a deal can’t be completed by year’s end at the hands of the FTC.\n\nIn the meantime, I’m staying bullish while shares trade at 10.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), just below the luxury goods industry average of 11.2 times P/E. Indeed, dip-buyers who pursued the name have been rewarded greatly.\n\nAs it stands today, TPR stock is in a better spot than it was in the back half of last year, with a lower bar to pass (revenue expectations have fallen to “more than $6.6 billion,” $100 million less than what analysts had hoped for).\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of TPR Stock?\n\nTPR stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with seven Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average TPR stock price target of $50.75 implies 20% upside potential.\n\nThe TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX)\n\nTJX Companies stock is in the midst of a nice multi-year bull run and recently made a new all-time high. The off-price retailer has continued to feed the hunger for discretionary bargains amid inflation’s painful pinch. With another strong earnings beat in the books for its recent fiscal second quarter (earnings per share of $0.93, ahead of the $0.88 expectation), it seems like the appetite for discounts is not fading.\n\nEither way, I’m staying bullish on TJX stock at 24.8 times trailing P/E as it continues to deliver on that sought-after “offline treasure hunt experience.”\n\nSame-store sales were up a modest 3% for the quarter — not incredible, but still decent for a retailer of nice-to-have goods. UBS (NYSE:UBS) analyst Jay Sole is a big fan of the stock, recently upgrading to Buy from Hold while hiking his price target by $28.00 to $132.00 per share.\n\nWhat’s behind Sole’s big upgrade? He sees “big potential” in some of TJX’s “newer businesses” in addition to the European business. Additionally, Sole no longer sees the firm’s lacking digital presence as an “existential threat.” He’s absolutely right.\n\nPerhaps staying mostly offline has been an edge for TJX. After all, you can’t really have that same “treasure hunt” experience online as you would at a brick-and-mortar location. And given the costs associated with a digital storefront, the deals (or earnings) probably wouldn’t have been as good as they are now.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of TJX Stock?\n\nTJX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average TJX stock price target of $114.44 implies 12% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsumers are becoming more selective about how and where they spend. The following three retail plays have sound value propositions relative to their industry rivals. This is bound to help them as inflation-hit folks seek out good deals on high-quality discretionary goods. Overall, out of the three stocks, analysts see the most upside from TPR stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will dissect whether QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the most unstoppable artificial intelligence (AI) stock to buy. We will also take a closer look at the advancements in the artificial intelligence industry. To view more unstoppable AI stocks, check our free report on the 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe Bull Case for AI\n\nOn April 20, Matt Bryson, Wedbush Enterprise Hardware Analyst, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the major players in the AI industry and how interest rate cuts may have little to no impact on the tech wave. Shares of tech stocks including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have been down by 15% over the past 30 days, followed by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping by 10% despite recent highs previously. Despite the pullback in industry activity, Bryson holds a bullish view on artificial intelligence. Bryson highlights the fuel in AI is backed by chip stocks and cloud services providers, lifting NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). He added that despite the pullback, large tech stocks, especially chip makers, will continue investing in AI in 2025 and post strong growth results. Bryson suggests that high interest rates will certainly weigh on consumer spending in the long run, impacting high multiple stocks such as large chipmakers. He then said that interest rates may have little to no impact on the fundamental landscape of technology and AI. According to Bryson, data center operators like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will continue to bet on developing AI applications.\n\nBryson thinks that NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell, a next-gen semiconductor product, will impact the industry positively. While he is certain that AI hardware and software companies will define parameters of success for the industry, he claims it is uncertain to predict the technological developments in AI at the moment. Bryson also holds a bullish view on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) after NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and talked about the possibility of companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) developing their own semiconductor products, altering Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited's (NYSE:TSM) position in the market. Bryson said while he expects the industry to grow, it is difficult to predict what sectors AI might penetrate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome Developments in the AI Space\n\nIn a groundbreaking update, On May 13, OpenAI launched GPT-4o, a platform capable of working across audio, vision, and text in real-time.

While the new product complements GPT-4 Turbo's performance on text in English and code, it is also 50% cheaper and much faster. The tool is also equipped to understand vision and audio inputs easily.\n\nOn May 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched CoPilot + PCs, designed for artificial intelligence. The new PCs are one of the most intelligent and fastest PCs to be ever built. Its new silicon can perform 40-plus trillion operations per second, has a long battery life, and comes with built-in advanced AI models. Individuals in the custody of the new devices will be able to generate and refine images in real-time using Cocreation and function in over 40 languages using the Live Captions tool. The PCs will be made available starting June 18.\n\nWall Street is Bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

        "content": "We recently covered 7 unstoppable artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy. Let's discuss whether NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most unstoppable AI stock. The company has been making headlines and popping up on the radars of analysts, hedge funds, and even retail investors on Wall Street Bets. To view the other unstoppable AI stocks, go to 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy.\n\nNVIDIA's Position in the AI Industry\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) produces the industry's leading GPUs for AI applications and has been at the forefront of the AI boom. The company's new Blackwell GPU, set to launch by the end of this year, is capable of producing trillion-parameter-scale AI models. The company also directs ample investment to the development of AI software products such as its Advanced AI platform for Enterprise that offers generative AI, data analytics, and inference.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is signing deals with large tech players to push demand for its industry-leading GPUs. On May 21, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a collaboration with Microsoft to facilitate the development and deployment of AI applications. Microsoft Corporation has developed an AI model, the Phi-3 family of small language models, optimized to operate on NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also offers microservices such as the CuOpt route optimization AI that is added to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise Platform. The two companies are also strictly involved in developing a range of optimizations and integrations for developers to create AI applications. These optimizations and integrations will be available in PCs powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\n\nOn May 22, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The company reported earnings per share of $6.12, beating estimates by $0.54. The company reported a staggering $26.04 billion in quarterly revenue, up 262% year-over-year and ahead of market consensus by $1.45 billion. The company's data center revenue grew by 23% to reach $22.6 billion, primarily driven by the demand for its Hopper GPU computing platform. Large cloud providers who are customers of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI infrastructure, accounted for 40% to 50% of data center revenue. Here are some comments from the company's Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\n\"In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation’s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe comments also reinforced the role of its new Blackwell GPU:\n\n\"At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling.\" Is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Most Unstoppable AI Stock to Buy Now?\n\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\n\nWhat Does the Stock Split Mean for NVIDIA?\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also announced a 10-1 stock split and a dividend hike of 150% on May 22 along with its earnings release. On May 23, Lou Basenese, Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the stock's performance after its awaited earnings release. The stock is up 90% year-to-date, as of May 23, and has reported strong earnings. The analyst, however, raised concerns about the slim margin by which NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat earnings. According to Basenese, the stock beat earnings expectations by 8%, the smallest it has ever been, relative to its 40% beat in the first blowout quarter preceding the AI hype. In response to NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision for the stock split, Basenese hinted that the move was great if looked through a psychological lens. He suggests that 40% of trading volume comes from retail investors, and the stock split will eventually push more in retail. He concludes the discussion by highlighting that NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA)  products are the backbone of AI applications produced by mega-tech companies, meaning the earnings results were quite predictable.\n\nOn May 23, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and raised their price target from $1,000 to $1,160. Rosenblatt, on the other hand, maintained a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a price target of $1,400. Over the past three months, 36 Wall Street analysts have held buy-equivalent ratings on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and have an average price target of $1,104. The stock's high forecast of $1,400 represents an upside of 5.65% from its current price of $1,041.19, as of May 23. According to analysts polled by Yahoo Finance, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings per share is expected to expand by 94% in 2025, compared to 2024. Despite NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong earnings report and a stellar year-to-date performance, the company ranks second on our list of the most unstoppable stocks to buy.\n\nIf you are interested in reading the most unstoppable AI stock to buy, head over to 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 104\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company that provides various services and products including but not limited to Medicaid plans, consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services, care delivery, software and information products, and pharmacy care services and programs.\n\nOn May 15, Bank of America Securities analyst Kevin Fischbeck reiterated a Buy rating on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) with a price target of $675.00. He cited several reasons for the rating, including the company’s effort to grow its long-term EPS to 13-16%, strong value-based care model, and adaptable business strategy. The company’s effective cost management and ability to maintain target margins were highlighted. The analyst expects the company’s continued growth with stable margins due to its disciplined pricing and sustainable benefit design.\n\nIn the first quarter, 104 hedge funds had stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), with total positions worth $8.66 billion. As of March 31, Fisher Asset Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company with a stake worth $1.47 billion.\n\nBaron Funds stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a leading health insurance company that operates across four segments: United Healthcare, Optum Health, OptumInsight, and OptumRX. Shares fell alongside other managed care organizations (MCOs) due to patient utilization of Medicare Advantage (MA) that was higher than consensus forecasts, raising concerns that MCOs had mispriced 2024 bids and could suffer margin compression as a result. In addition, the industry is facing headwinds from MA reimbursement cuts and Star Rating changes. While management said higher cost trends are mostly transitory and reflected in its bidding, and 2024 guidance was roughly in line with consensus, investors took a more cautious wait-and-see approach. We believe UnitedHealth should remain a core portfolio holding, as it is a way to play positive demographic, population health, and value-based reimbursement trends.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. businessman Elon Musk recently told investors that his artificial intelligence startup xAI is planning to build a supercomputer to power the next version of its AI chatbot Grok, The Information reported on Saturday citing a presentation to investors.\n\nMusk said he wants to get the proposed supercomputer running by the fall of 2025, as per the report, adding that xAI could partner with Oracle to develop the massive computer.\n\nxAI could not be immediately reached for comment. Oracle did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nWhen completed, the connected groups of chips — Nvidia’s flagship H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) — would be at least four times the size of the biggest GPU clusters that exist today, The Information reported quoting Musk from a presentation made to investors in May.\n\nNvidia's H100 family of powerful GPUs dominate the data center chip market for AI but can be hard to obtain due to high demand.\n\nMusk founded xAI last year as a challenger to Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet's Google. Musk also co-founded OpenAI.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk said training the Grok 2 model took about 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, adding that the Grok 3 model and beyond will require 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips.\n\n(Reporting by Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Josie Kao)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation Just Beat Earnings Expectations: Here's What Analysts Think Will Happen Next",
        "content": "As you might know, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) just kicked off its latest quarterly results with some very strong numbers. NVIDIA beat earnings, with revenues hitting US$26b, ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share outperforming analyst reckonings by a solid 15%. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from NVIDIA's 53 analysts is for revenues of US$120.5b in 2025. This reflects a substantial 51% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to shoot up 48% to US$25.57. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$112.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$23.21 in 2025. So it seems there's been a definite increase in optimism about NVIDIA's future following the latest results, with a nice increase in the earnings per share forecasts in particular.\n\nWith these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 14% to US$1,166per share. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on NVIDIA, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$1,400 and the most bearish at US$754 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await NVIDIA shareholders.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The analysts are definitely expecting NVIDIA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 73% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 37% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 17% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect NVIDIA to grow faster than the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around NVIDIA's earnings potential next year. Pleasantly, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on NVIDIA. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for NVIDIA going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nDon't forget that there may still be risks.

        "title": "Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's Time to Shine: Beating the S&amp;P, But for How Long?",
        "content": "Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's Time to Shine: Beating the S&P, But for How Long?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nDespite the rampant market volatility, the technology sector has long delivered superior returns compared to the broader market equities. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year, boasting an impressive 31.2% return compared to the S&P 500 index’s 28%.\n\nTech stocks have long been hailed as the champions of the stock market, with the Magnificent Seven stocks delivering stellar yet consistent performance. For instance, shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are up over 88% over the past year, while the AI-pioneer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has surged by over 210% over this period.\n\nThe generative AI boom has continued to create a buzz, with Big Tech companies aggressively incorporating AI into their products and services to stay ahead in a market projected to exceed $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade.\n\nTech's Lackluster Performance as Headwinds Pile On\n\nWhile the long-term performance of tech stocks has been spectacular, the increasing economic turmoil has caused them to lose their spark. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's\n\nOver the past month, the tech sector fund saw a decline of 5.82%, mirroring the broader tech market’s struggles, as the S&P 500 gained 5.2%. Over the three-month period, XLK slipped by 0.55% while the S&P 500 advanced by 4.4%.\n\nTech giants are currently dealing with significant upheaval, causing their stocks to underperform despite posting better-than-expected earnings. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is currently in the middle of a major restructuring, while Meta Platform predicts a slowing growth trajectory in the upcoming quarters, causing its shares to drop by about 3% over the past three months.\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is dealing with mass layoffs, price cuts and disappointing earnings results as the company reported the largest year-over-year revenue decline since 2012 for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nPersistent Inflation Woes\n\nThe tenacious inflation rates and delayed rate cuts have also caused investors to pull out of tech stocks lately. The release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from their April 30 to May 1 policy meeting added to the market’s jitters, as it revealed a stark lack of progress in recent months toward curbing inflation.\n\n\"Participants observed that while inflation had eased over the past year, in recent months, there had been a lack of further progress toward the Committee's 2% objective,\" the summary concluded, \"The recent monthly data had showed significant increases in components of both goods and services price inflation.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOptimism Amidst Volatility\n\nDespite the recent sell-off, some analysts remain bullish on Big Tech. Barclays, for instance, continues to have a positive outlook on the sector.\n\n\"Big Tech fundamentals still look good here, and we think there's room to run over the next couple of quarters, even though the bar for the group to deliver has been set very high. Big Tech revisions have strengthened further post-Q1 earnings, bifurcating even more from the rest of the S&P 500,\" said Venu Krishna, strategist at Barclays.\n\nFurthermore, NVIDIA Corp’s strong earnings report took the market by storm, as shares of the AI-chipmaker crossed $1,000 for the first time on May 22. The company's better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report, coupled with its 10-for-1 stock split announcement, has taken the market by storm, driving the Nasdaq Composite to hit a fresh high on May 23.\n\nAdd a Little Stability to Your Portfolio\n\nWhile some analysts believe tech stocks still have room to grow, others speculate that a major correction could be in the near future. Diversifying your portfolio with income generating assets can help you weather a market downturn by providing consistent cashflow regardless of which direction stocks are heading. One extremely popular option right now is private credit, particularly private credit backed by real estate. Two trusted options are the Arrived Private Credit Fund and Basecamp Alpine Notes.\n\nThe Arrived Private Credit Fund simplifies investing in short-term financing for real estate projects, providing attractive yields secured by quality residential real estate. With target annualized dividends of 7-9%, quarterly liquidity, and a diversified pool of real estate-backed loans, this fund is an excellent complement to equity investing.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\n\nBasecamp Alpine Notes from EquityMultiple offer another powerful short-term cash management tool, with a target APY of 9.00% over a 3-month term and a minimum investment of only $1,000. These notes provide high liquidity and compelling rates with compounding interest, making them an ideal choice for investors looking to build their income-generating portfolio.

        "title": "3 Penny Stocks to Buy Now If You’re Short on Cash But Big on Dreams",
        "content": "The top U.S. stock market indices continue to notch fresh highs, with the heightened enthusiasm surrounding potential interest rate cuts this year. Market analysts are pricing in a couple of rate cuts later this year of 25 basis points each. Moreover, we’re also seeing gold prices rally to all-time highs, signaling that rate cuts may be around the corner. Hence, amidst this positivity, it’s an excellent time to consider investing in high-potential penny stocks to buy.\n\nWagering on the penny stocks to buy can prove incredibly lucrative, especially if you can identify diamonds in the rough. It’s imperative to tread lightly, considering their notorious reputation for burning shareholder value. Those who can understand this dichotomy are set to reap massive long-term rewards. Here are three penny stocks to buy with promising growth potential that are poised to surge in a full-blown bull market.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: VAALCO Energy (EGY) EGY Stock\n\nVAALCO Energy (NYSE:EGY) stock may slightly exceed the typical penny stock range (under $5), but it’s far too cheap to ignore. Trading under 1.50 times forward sales estimates,  EGY stock attracts a ‘moderate buy’ rating from Wall-Street, with a 50% upside from current prices. Additionally, it also offers a dividend, yielding almost 4%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor those who don’t know, VAALCO is an independent oil and gas producer with operations in multiple locations, including Egypt, Gabon, and Canada. Like its peers, the Russia/Ukraine conflict triggered a massive surge in energy demand, bolstering VAALCO’s top- and bottom-line performances.\n\nThe past three quarters, in particular, were excellent for VAALCO, with revenues jumping 43% on average. In its most recent quarterly earnings print, revenues were up 25% to $100.1 million, while its EPS of six cents per share beat estimates by three cents. Moreover, net income for the quarter was at a healthy $7.7 million, up substantially from $3.4 million in the first-quarter (Q1) of 2023.\n\nThe company is benefitting from the favorable economic environment, while its efficient management contributed to a robust quarter. Additionally, its strategic acquisition of Svenska Petroleum Exploration AB for $40.2 million significantly increased its productive capacity. The resumption of operations at the Baobab field also significantly boosted the company’s output.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) SOUN stock: SoundHound's Headquarters exterior featuring a sign with the company's logo in the foreground and a parking lot and building in the background.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nAI-powered voice solutions provider SoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) has been one of the hottest penny stocks in the past year. SOUN stock has surged an eye-catching 142% year-to-date (YTD), dwarfing the S&P 500’s 12% gain. A few months ago, SOUN stock got a massive boost when AI bellwether Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed a considerable stake in the business. However, most experts felt it needed another significant driver to sustain its rally —cue its first-quarter (Q1) earnings explosion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound delivered a spectacular 73% bump in year-over-year (YOY) sales to $11.6 million, beating market estimates by $1.49 million. Additionally, its loss per share of seven cents beat analyst estimates by one cent per share. Also, it raised the lower end of its sales forecast to $77 million, a $65 million jump.

        "content": "It’s understandable why most of investor attention in the chips space right now goes to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company continues to blow out earnings expectations and is the king of this space — no doubt.\n\nThe thing is, there are plenty of other AI stocks to consider investing in right now. This is a sector as vast and diversified as one can invest in.\n\nThat’s why I’m going to focus on three companies that stand a chance of carving out their own unique growth areas of the market right now. Here are three semiconductor stocks to buy that I think deserve more attention in this AI-driven market right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nFounded over 40 years ago, Netherlands–based ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) aims to revolutionize and advance semiconductor tool systems. The company is large in the metrology, inspection systems and lithography sectors. ASML stock surged 40% in the past year, surpassing the S&P 500 Index’s gains. Despite a dip in post-Q1 earnings, it rose 26% year-to-date, outpacing the SPX.\n\nThe Dutch semiconductor equipment leader revealed its dividend increase plans in late April. ASML’s board declared a final dividend of €1.75 per ordinary share, resulting in an annualized dividend of €6.10 and about a 0.60% yield. With a prudent 32.5% payout ratio, ASML retains room for growth and potential dividend boosts.\n\nMoreover, the company also revealed its share buyback program, targeted to repurchase its shares until late 2025.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a reasonably valued chipmaker with a 28.02 P/E ratio boasts a 1.69% yield and 22 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Over the past decade, it has maintained a 7.3% annual dividend growth rate.\n\nOn Wednesday, Qualcomm unveiled its latest innovation, the Snapdragon X Plus laptop processor, integrating AI capabilities to enhance competition in the market. With over 37% assurance in faster CPU performance and 54% less power consumption, the chip will work well on any QCOM’s Snapdragon X series. That also includes the AI-powered Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nThe Snapdragon chip was recently commended for its AI enhancements for both video and photo capabilities. The advancements put the company in a great light amid growing demand for AI chips.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nWith a 54% year-to-date, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) remains a chip yet undervalued favorite. The company is also in demand for its advanced tech in 3mm and 5mm chips. As AI-capable phones, like the anticipated iPhone 16, drive sales, TSM’s potential in the semiconductor market shouldn’t be underestimated.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the 2024 North America Technology Symposium on April 24, TSMC unveiled its latest semiconductor advancements, including the A16™ technology with nanosheet transistors for enhanced logic density and performance by 2026. Additionally, the company introduced System-on-Wafer (TSMC-SoW™) technology to meet AI demands in hyperscaler data centers.\n\nThe company also serves as a cornerstone in the semiconductor sector, supplying many companies directly. Despite concerns about the “China threat” and onshoring, its robust financials and $40 billion investment in U.S. chip manufacturing suggest resilience. With strong revenue growth, solid margins and high demand for advanced nodes, TSM remains a top pick for semiconductor exposure.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Buying tech stocks on the dip can generate meaningful long-term returns, especially as investors abandon previous favorites. Some tech stocks that grew out of favor in 2022 logged impressive gains the following year.\n\nNot all tech stocks are meant to reclaim their all-time highs, and some investors may have to wait patiently before dips become present for their favorite tech stocks. You may want to keep these investments on your radar when the stock market enters a correction and drags down individual stocks.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is in the middle of a correction that hopefully goes deeper. The stock trades at a 180 P/E ratio, and a further dip can make it more affordable. While the valuation is a bit high, the corporation is doing everything else right.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe educational tech company has a vibrant language learning app that has expanded into additional subjects like music and math. People have been flocking to the app and have been staying active on it. Duolingo reported 31.4 million daily active users and 97.6 million monthly active users in Q1 2024. Those figures represent 54% and 35% year-over-year gains, respectively.\n\nDuolingo also reported solid financials. Revenue increased by 45% year-over-year while net income flipped from a $2.6 million net loss to a $27.0 million profit in one year. Doling’s rising profit margins are a key strength that can support meaningful gains in the years ahead. However, market sentiment and a lofty valuation can result in a more attractive buying opportunity if investors are patient.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt doesn’t seem like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will dip anytime soon, but it can become attractive when the dip finally takes shape. Nvidia’s latest earnings report demonstrated why it’s at the top of the AI race.\n\nNvidia can amass the largest market cap among publicly traded corporations. Revenue increased by 262% year-over-year in Q1 FY25, while net income surged by 628% year-over-year. Shares now trade at a 60 P/E ratio and have doubled year-to-date. The stock has also increased by more than 2,700% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech stock has been very popular among Wall Street analysts. It’s rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 14% upside. Recent price targets after Nvidia’s earnings blowout suggest the stock can rally by as much as 36% from current levels. The highest price target is currently $1,400 per share.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) trades at an 88 forward P/E ratio, which may scare off value investors. The high valuation makes it due for a correction, but other than that, the corporation is solid.\n\nCrowdstrike stock has more than doubled over the past year, and its financial results indicate why that’s the case. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in Q4 FY24. Net income came to $53.7 million compared to a net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nBusinesses need to protect themselves from online hackers. These cyber criminals use AI tools and other resources to infiltrate databases and access sensitive information. Crowdstrike allows business owners to detect threats and stop them before hackers obtain valuable assets. Crowdstrike also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue, a good foundation for future financial growth. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 16% upside.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTech FOMO is real and investors are acting accordingly.\n\nThe last two years of “Magnificent” gains from the seven megacap stocks leading markets have convinced investors that tech is the sector to be in, lest they get left behind.\n\nIn a Friday note to clients, Bank of America’s head US equity strategist, Savita Subramanian, observed that stocks with the biggest increases in ownership from long-only active mutual funds over the last year were dominated by tech, which took nine of the top 10 spots, as our Chart of the Week shows.\n\nThe outlier was Eli Lilly (LLY), one of the major players in GLP-1s, the booming weight-loss drug family including Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. However, the advent of seemingly magical weight-loss drugs is, at worst, a close cousin of the tech-centric innovation bandied about by AI players.\n\nOver 68% of funds now hold Nvidia (NVDA), the most popular stock on the list, and the biggest increase was Broadcom (AVGO), which saw fund ownership go from 26% in April 2023 to 45% a year later.\n\n“Within [tech], the number of ‘AI’ mentions on earnings calls was positively correlated with the change in percent of funds owning each stock,” Subramanian added, dispelling any doubts as to what we’re talking about here.\n\nTech is obviously having a moment, thanks to AI. And with tech having enjoyed a few of these in the last decade, nobody wants to miss another wave of PC, internet, phone, or Facebook. This data also speaks clearly when it comes to what investors don’t think they’ll get in trouble for owning.\n\nThe chart’s AI companies, and the weight-loss drugmaker, also fit a tech-centric mold of big bets.\n\nLeaps forward in innovation power productivity shifts, which power an increase in earnings, which are reflected in the stock market’s value. Subramanian notes \"the market continues to feel narrow,\" considering how Big Tech is getting positive earnings estimate revisions while the other 493 non-megacaps are getting cuts.\n\nAt the same time, the BofA team sees “old economy” stocks already benefiting from AI. The “picks and shovels” companies like copper and power that are producing AI supply aren’t the only ones benefitting; companies on the demand side are too.\n\nCompanies, then, appear to already be using AI to boost productivity. Which, in time, should make the market feel a bit less narrow. Even if those trades aren’t as shiny as what investors piled into over the last year.\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is It Time to Dump Nvidia Stock for Advanced Micro Devices After Microsoft Announcement?",
        "content": "Microsoft recently announced that it would offer its cloud computing customers the option of using MI300X artificial intelligence (AI) chips made by Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). Microsoft will offer clusters of MI300X chips through its Azure cloud computing service as an alternative to Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nGiven this announcement, is it time to dump Nvidia stock in favor of AMD?\n\nThe simple answer is no. Expanding on that answer, it might be a good time to buy both stocks -- and another beneficiary as well.\n\nWhy Microsoft started offering AMD chips\n\nMicrosoft isn't offering cloud customers the option of AMD GPUs as a knock on Nvidia's GPUs, which have become the industry standard for helping power AI applications in the data center. The issue is that Nvidia's chips are so popular that it is becoming difficult for companies to get hold of them. This isn't a bad problem to have.\n\nBoth Nvidia and AMD are having difficulty keeping up with demand for their GPUs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, said that its advanced packaging capacity is fully booked for both the rest of this year and next. It's presumed this is due to demand for GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD, which are both top-10 customers of the company.\n\nTSCM is working to aggressively expand its production capacity to meet AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) chip demand. The company now plans to build a third fabrication facility (fab) in Arizona after its first facility in the state just began wafer production. It also just completed its first specialty technology fab in Japan and announced a second in the country to be completed by the end of 2027. It is also building a fab in Germany for automotive and industrial applications, scheduled to start construction late this year.\n\nTSMC is also looking to fully develop its 2-nanometer chip technology. Within the semiconductor industry, as technology moves to smaller nodes (semiconductor sizes), more chips can fit on a wafer, which increases production capacity and lowers costs.\n\nHowever, until this technology and fab expansion take hold, the market for GPUs looks like it will remain tight. Image source: Getty Images\n\nTime to buy Nvidia, AMD, and TSMC\n\nInstead of dumping Nvidia, now could be a great time for investors to buy both Nvidia and AMD stock, as well as TSMC. The demand for high-performance computing chips and GPUs is massive, and the industry is currently struggling to meet demand.\n\nNvidia remains the clear leader, and its growth has been nothing short of spectacular. The company long ago became the GPU industry standard before the advent of AI through its CUDA software platform, which allows its GPUs to be programmed directly. At this point, the company can likely sell as many chips as its foundry partners can produce. These days most semiconductor companies don't own their own manufacturing facilities, and instead use contract manufacturers like TSCM.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD, meanwhile, is a nice beneficiary of a very tight GPU market. With its Q1 results, the company just raised its expected full-year data center GPU revenue from $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion. And with Nvidia GPUs difficult to get, AMD has the opportunity to make inroads into this market and become a viable number-two player. Companies generally don't like to rely too heavily on one supplier, so the current market dynamics could give AMD a longer-lasting boost if its chips are well received.\n\nTSCM, meanwhile, is a prime beneficiary of GPU and chip demand, as companies race to get these chips to power AI applications. By adding additional fabs and moving to 2-nanometer technology, TSCM is set to benefit from the AI chip boom. It also will benefit as other companies jump on board. For example, it has been reported that Arm Holdings and Softbank have been looking to design an AI chip, while companies like Amazon have gotten into the AI chip business as well. Apple executives, meanwhile, have been reported to have met with TSMC to reserve 2-nanometer production to help it catch up in AI. This all benefits TSMC.\n\nWhen looking at valuations, TSMC is the cheapest stock, trading at about 24 times forward P/E. It is even cheaper on an enterprise value-to-EBITDA basis, trading near 13 times. This metric takes into consideration its net debt position and takes out non-cash expenses. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, trades at a forward P/E of 37, and 32 on an EV/EBITDA basis. Given its growth, this is an inexpensive valuation.\n\nAMD is the most expensive stock of the group, trading at a forward P/E of over 47 and an EV/EBITDA multiple of over 50. However, the company has not yet seen the potential AI chip inflection point that the other two companies have, so it still holds potential.\n\nIn order of preference at this time, Nvidia would be my first choice, closely followed by TSMC, and then AMD. However, all three stocks hold strong long-term potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Large-Cap Stocks That Have Roughly Doubled Nvidia's Returns Over the Past Year",
        "content": "Chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the great investing stories in tech over the past couple of years. With the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT and companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia's business is booming as its chips play a big role in helping companies develop their own AI models. That business boom is helping the stock soar. In the past 12 months, its price is up about 238%.\n\nBut as well as Nvidia's stock has done in the past year, there are a couple of other large-cap stocks that have performed even better. Two stocks that have roughly doubled Nvidia's returns over the past 12 months include Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA). Here's a look at their returns over this time frame and why they have been such hot buys, and whether they still make for good investments today.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: 445%\n\nWith gains of 445%, Super Micro's stock has dwarfed Nvidia's 12-month returns. As with Nvidia, this has become a popular AI investment to own as demand for more servers and greater computing power has made investors bullish on the company's long-term prospects.\n\nSuper Micro's growth rate has been amazing, with sales totaling just under $3.9 billion through the first three months of the year -- three times the $1.3 billion it reported in the previous year. The company generates revenue primarily from its server and storage systems segment. Subsystems and accessories, its other segment, accounted for a relatively modest $152 million last quarter, representing just 4% of the company's overall top line. Profitability has also been improving, with Super Micro reporting $402 million in profit during the period, which was more than four times the $86 million in earnings it posted in the prior-year period.\n\nA big reason for Super Micro's enhanced returns over the past year is simply due to its much smaller valuation. Even with its massive returns, Super Micro's market cap is at $53 billion -- nowhere near Nvidia's mammoth $2.3 trillion valuation. What's encouraging is that the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25, which is fairly modest given the gains the stock has already achieved. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at a forward P/E of 38.\n\nWith tremendous growth, solid prospects for more, and a fairly reasonable valuation given its long-term growth opportunities, it may still not be too late to invest in Super Micro stock.\n\nCarvana: 876%\n\nInvestors could have earned an even greater return from Carvana's stock over the past year but not without taking on a lot more risk. This once-beaten-down stock would have been a nine-bagger for investors who loaded up on it a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that this was the stock nobody wanted: In 2022, shares of Carvana plummeted an amazing 98%. The online used-car retailer was burning through cash, interest rates began to rise, and demand for used cars softened.\n\nThe stock is heavily shorted, and that plays a big part in its overall volatility. While the short interest as a percentage of float has come down over the past year, it remains fairly high at around 30%. CVNA Percent of Float Short Chart\n\nThe company has been proving its doubters wrong, at least to some extent, and that has helped drive the recent bullishness.\n\nFor the period ending March 31, Carvana posted a surprise profit of $49 million, which is a drastic improvement from the $286 million loss it incurred in the same period a year earlier. Sales of $3.1 billion were also up by 17% year over year. The company's cash-flow statement has also shown improvement as last quarter Carvana generated $101 million in cash from its day-to-day operating activities, while a year ago it burned through $66 million.\n\nCarvana generated some encouraging results last quarter, but that doesn't mean it's smooth sailing for the business as it's possible that a recession could still be on the horizon. And while the company has been doing better, it still hasn't proven it can generate consistent profits; its profit margin last quarter was just 1.6%.\n\nInvestors may be better off waiting at least a couple of quarters before assessing whether Carvana is truly a good buy or not, as the stock still possesses some considerable risk, especially given its volatility over the past few years and high short interest.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Gavekal Research strategists highlighted the unusual trend of US asset prices climbing despite a contraction in money supply, a divergence from the typical correlation where excessive money supply growth favors asset price increases.\n\nWhile the traditional link has shown signs of weakening, US equity prices, along with other assets such as gold, cryptocurrencies, and industrial metals, have continued to rise.\n\nThe research firm suggests that non-monetary factors could be influencing asset prices. For instance, equities have been bolstered by factors such as the rollout of artificial intelligence, which has boosted corporate earnings.\n\nA notable example is the recent earnings beat by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), indicating that the AI boom persists.\n\nUnlike the early 2000s, US tech companies currently do not appear to have excessive capital spending plans.\n\nGold prices have also surged since February, driven by demand from countries with loose monetary policies, unattractive property sectors, or geopolitical motives to diversify away from US dollar-based assets.\n\nIndustrial metals are experiencing increased demand due to the growth of AI data centers and the need to enhance the global electrical grid.\n\nCryptocurrencies have seen a rally, partly due to regulatory approvals for exchange-traded funds on bitcoin and ether, which are expected to broaden the investor base.\n\nThe introduction of gold ETFs in 2004 had a similar effect, increasing accessibility for retail investors and subsequently driving up gold prices.\n\nWhat about other macro drivers\n\nMacro factors are also at play in the US money supply and market dynamics.\n\n\"In the last few months, however, the RRP drain has abated, suggesting a temporary equilibrium has been reached,\" Gavekal strategists noted.\n\n\"If so, this positive liquidity driver for markets may be ending. Even if the RRP drain resumes, there is only US$496bn left to draw down.\"\n\nHowever, the market anticipates a loosening of US monetary policy, with the Fed set to reduce the pace of quantitative tightening starting next month, which could lead to renewed growth in money supply.\n\nInvestors are now faced with the possibility that asset prices may decline if the drivers supporting them weaken, especially as most asset prices have shown signs of softening in the past few days.\n\n\"In fact, with most asset prices having softened in the last couple of days—with the notable exceptions of Nvidia stock and the ether currency—one has to wonder if this is already starting to play out,\" the report noted.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS asset prices are rising despite falling money supply\n\nHSBC's deep dive look at the good, the bad, and the ugly of AI\n\nThai hospital says 43 people from Singapore Airlines flight still under treatment\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) recently gave investors more evidence that the surge in demand for its data center products powering artificial intelligence (AI) applications has more legs. That helped persuade Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann to continue to recommend investors buy the stock.\n\nHis firm's $1,400 price target for Nvidia stock remains one of the highest on Wall Street. That represents upside of about 34% even after Nvidia shares popped following its fiscal 2025 first-quarter results. Nvidia shares have now more than doubled in 2024.\n\nNvidia beats expectations again\n\nThe strength in Nvidia's AI business hasn't been a secret for investors. Expectations have been high, but the company continues to surpass Wall Street's, and its own, estimates. Consider that the three months ended April 28 marked the fourth straight quarter in which the company beat its own revenue guidance by at least $2 billion.\n\nYear over year revenue by business segment increased as follows:\n\nData center: 427% Gaming: 18% Ominverse: 45% Automotive and robotics: 11%\n\nWhile the company is growing all areas, its data center AI business is what's driving the stock right now. Mosesmann thinks that will continue, with the company outperforming expectations as Nvidia projects another meaningful jump in sales in the current fiscal quarter.\n\nNvidia wants even more of the AI pie\n\nSome investors thought near-term demand would wane as customers wait for the more powerful Blackwell architecture. But clearly that hasn't happened, and Blackwell shipments are expected to begin before the end of this year. In the earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang commented, \"We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production.\"\n\nThe runway for growth in AI spending looks to be a long one. And Nvidia continues to innovate in other areas as well. The company wants to offer more and more value to customers. It is including software solutions with its server stack offerings.\n\nThat makes me think the $1,400 price target will only be a stop along the way to even higher prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks That Could Be Millionaire-Makers: May Edition",
        "content": "As an expression of the digital age, the metaverse comes in many forms depending on investor focus. One could view it as supplemented or displaced reality via augmented reality/virtual reality headsets like Meta Platform’s (NASDAQ:META) Oculus Quest or Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. As we delve deeper into this realm, identifying promising metaverse stocks to buy becomes crucial. The app ecosystem, which forms the baseline for metaverse content, offers numerous opportunities for savvy investors to capitalize on this evolving market.\n\nMetaverse could also be viewed as the totality of different components. In addition to augmented reality, it would bring in tradeable digital assets from various blockchain networks. This would form a new layer of the economy conducted in virtual space.\n\nOn top of it, artificial intelligence (AI) agents would then bring an additional layer of immersion for people to interact with e-commerce, gaming and social networking. According to a Mordor Intelligence report, the metaverse market size is about $116 billion in 2024. By 2029, it is forecasted to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41.83% to $670 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is, which are the metaverse stocks to buy that will power this growth to the benefit of shareholders?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a chipmaker in competition with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is seldom viewed as a metaverse stock. However, if this market is to gain mass adoption, AMD will play a key role.\n\nKnown for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) that are also competitively priced, AMD is now pushing accelerated processing units (APUs) further. These chips combine both central processing and parallel graphics in a single package. Since the introduction of Fusion APU in 2011, these chips now rival modern gaming consoles with the Ryzen 8000G series.\n\nIn other words, AMD is opening the way for cheap mini PCs that don’t require expensive and bulky discrete GPUs. In that capacity, AMD is creating all-purpose computing platforms which is exactly what the baseline metaverse layer would need.\n\nInterestingly, the financial markets have shown a mixed reaction to AMD’s innovations and market positioning. Over the last year, AMD’s stock increased by around 66%, reflecting investor optimism about its role in emerging technologies. However, Nvidia saw a substantial rise of around 188% largely due to its dominance in AI technologies. AMD, on the other hand, has not gained as much traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is releasing Kraken APUs next year as the next level of performance on 4 nanometer (nm) chip nodes. In the meantime, AMD is heading against Nvidia on the AI front as well with the more cost-effective MI300X chips. Most importantly for investors, Nvidia stole the AI spotlight, leaving AMD stock somewhat underutilized.\n\nAt the present price of $166.33, AMD stock is still far from its all-time high of $227.30 this past March. One-year consensus price targets place AMD shares at $192.56, indicating a potential for a $265 per share ceiling.\n\nUnity Software (U) A developer works on a 3D racing game in the Unity engine on a laptop.\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile AMD, Intel and Nvidia provide the hardware components for metaverse blocks, Unity Software (NYSE:U) is the dominant software platform to create metaverse content. Its Unity Engine is widely used across mobile, console and desktop computers due to easily accessible development tools and a vast library of online tutorials.\n\nAccording to a 6sense survey, Unity holds 27% market share in the game development category. For comparison, the Unreal Engine from privately-held Epic Games, holds 16% market share.\n\nFollowing the departure of Unity CEO John Riccitiello last October, the company is yet to balance its licensing monetization approach. On May 9, Unity delivered its first-quarter earnings. Despite a net loss of $291 million, the bulk went into restructuring costs ($212 million) and convertible notes ($61 million).\n\nIn that light, Unity’s net loss would have only accounted for $141 million. That is a significant improvement over last year’s $254 million net loss. Moving forward, much is expected of Unity 6 for easier multiplatform deployment and AI tools.\n\nOn the monetization front, developers can take advantage of Unity’s integrated Unity Ads and ironSource Ads platform. Unity gets a cut from any deals. On that progress to profitability, Unity Software holds $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor metaverse investors, this translates to buying on the weakness, which typically provides the greatest profit potential long-term. Given these factors, Unity Software emerges as a compelling choice among metaverse stocks to buy. Year-to-date, U stock is down 45%. At the present price of $21.27, U shares are far removed from their all-time high of $201.12 in November 2021. Nasdaq’s average U price target is $29.05 per share.\n\nVuzix (VUZI) Vuzix (VUZI) branded AR glasses\n\nSource: zixia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere have been many attempts at unassuming AR glasses, but Vuzix (NASDAQ:VUZI) appears to have hit the sweet spot with Vuzix Z100. Revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024, these smart glasses can embed prescription lenses and run for two days on a single charge. As investors explore metaverse stocks to buy, Vuzix offers intriguing potential due to its innovative products and ongoing projects.\n\nThe glasses are designed as workflow augmentation rather than immersion. Vuzix built upon three decades of extended reality (XR) experience to develop them. Still a penny stock, Vuzix delivered a net loss of $10.048 million in Q1 2024, in line with the year-ago quarter at $10.241 million.\n\nGiven the reduced sales of M400 glasses, the company saw a 52% decline in revenue. Yet, Vuzix remains positive for the near future with “several new projects with new and existing defense and consumer product-focused customers” during 2024.\n\nSimilar to China’s adoption of smart glasses in law enforcement, the same trend is likely to unfold in the U.S. VUZI stock is down 25% year-to-date. At $1.60 per share, VUZI shares are now 19x lower from the all-time high of $30.57 in April 2021. Yet, the average VUZI price target is nearly double at $3 per share.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Will Nvidia Stock Join the Dow After Its 10-for-1 Split? Some Analysts Think So.",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) looks set to close out an excellent week on a high note. After blowing past Wall Street estimates, the artificial intelligence leader announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. This news sent Nvidia stock surging, as investors prepared for the inevitable trading frenzy that precedes a stock split.\n\nBut some analysts see another positive catalyst on the horizon for the tech sensation.\n\nThe stock split could help Nvidia secure a place on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). This would set an extremely positive tone for the already strong company as it prepares to rise even further in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat’s Happening with Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia stock has risen 12% over the past week and looks primed to continue rising. The momentum from the Q1 earnings beat and enthusiasm for the pending stock split should be enough to keep it on an upward trajectory for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe question remains, though, can it make it onto the Dow Jones Industrial Average?\n\nAt this point, it certainly seems likely. However, it is slightly difficult to assess how likely it is, as there’s no specific number that Nvidia needs to hit. Whether or not it joins this exclusive club will depend on the committee that oversees it. As CNBC reports:\n\n“Decisions on additions and deletions to the Dow is made by the S&P Dow Jones Indices Index Committee. There are no specific rules for inclusion or exclusion, but the committee has said that ‘a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.’”\n\nThere’s no doubt that Nvidia is a contender. Analysts are speculating that retail investors will rush to snap up shares following the Nvidia stock split. The high-growth AI stock has surged nearly 250% over the past year, demonstrating that there’s not much that can keep it down. A favorite among hedge funds, Nvidia stock currently boasts a “strong buy” rating on TipRanks, with 37 out of 40 analysts maintaining “buy” ratings.\n\nWill Nvidia Topple Intel?\n\nAt this point, it seems inevitable that Nvidia stock will end up kicking Intel out of DJIA.\n\nWhile NVDA has been rising steadily over the past year, INTC has been gradually trending downward and bleeding value. Its shares are down 35% in the year to date and are up just 6% over the past 12 months.\n\nIntel is facing new problems due to the looming trade restrictions against certain U.S.-China trade, which will include semiconductors. Although Nvidia will face similar struggles, experts are less worried given its dominance in AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs is the nature of financial markets, one company’s loss is another’s gain. Investors should keep a close eye on Nvidia for Dow inclusion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nSamuel O’Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik\n\n(Reuters) - Shares of Dell Technologies hit a record high on Friday amid a rally in companies working on generative artificial intelligence applications, buoyed by strong optimism for the new technology.\n\nAI-heavyweight Nvidia posted strong quarterly results and forecast current-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, reinforcing that customers' spending on genAI will continue to hold strong. The positive momentum extended to Dell, which has recently launched AI-oriented personal computers and more powerful servers in collaboration with Nvidia.\n\n\"This as an important and timely new opportunity for Dell,\" said Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.\n\nDell shares rose 6% to $162.82 after paring some gains in the afternoon and were on track to add $6.6 billion to its market value. The stock, which has more than doubled year to date, ended in the green in the previous three sessions.\n\nOn Friday, shares of major chip firms were up between Nvidia's nearly 1% rise and Qualcomm's 4% gain. U.S.-listed shares of Arm Holdings were up 2.3%.\n\nShare of software companies C3.ai and Palantir Technologies were up 0.6% and 1.6% respectively.\n\n\"Chip companies are expected to benefit heavily from AI chip-related orders, primarily from Cloud providers, who have indicated significant increase in their capex for 2024,\" said Akshara Bassi, an analyst at Couterpoint Research.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Priyanka G in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Taiwan Semi Leads While China's SMIC Climbs to Third in Global Chip Market\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s leading foundry by revenue in the first quarter.\n\nChina’s State-backed SMIC, or Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co, held a market share of 6% in the first quarter, up from 5% last year.\n\nThis growth places SMIC behind only TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung Foundry, which held 62% and 13% of the market share, respectively, CNBC cites Counterpoint.\n\nAlso Read: ASML and Taiwan Semi Prep for Potential China-Taiwan Conflict with Remote Shutdown Feature\n\nSMIC’s quarterly results exceeded market expectations, securing the third position in foundry revenue market share in the first quarter of 2024 for the first time. The recovery of demand in China contributed to this achievement.\n\nSMIC’s chips are used in automobiles, smartphones, computers, IoT technologies, and more. Chinese smartphone company Huawei Technologies Co has tapped SMIC to produce crucial 5G mobile chipsets.\n\nSMIC reported first-quarter revenue of $1.75 billion, a 19.7% increase from a year earlier. Over 80% of its revenue was derived from customers in China. For the second quarter, SMIC expects revenue to increase by 5%—7% from the first quarter.\n\nChina consumes nearly 50% of the world’s semiconductors. Prior reports indicated China launched a $40 billion state fund to strengthen its chip sector in response to the U.S. ban.\n\nHuawei and SMIC developed an advanced 7-nanometer smartphone processor, marking progress toward a self-sufficient Chinese chip ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, several Chinese semiconductor design firms partnered with Malaysian companies to assemble high-end chips to bypass restrictions.\n\nOn Thursday, TSMC projected 10% annual growth in the global semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips driven by the artificial intelligence frenzy.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s best career advice came from an elderly gardener",
        "content": "Surrounded by moss, in a boiling valley with not a breeze to be seen or felt, Jensen Huang stumbled upon an unlikely mentor while off the beaten path.\n\n“Anybody who’s been to Kyoto knows how incredibly hot it is during the summer,” Huang said at the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association in 2023, speaking of his time in a temple in the city, which hosts the most extensive collection of moss in the world. There, Huang received the best career advice.\n\nInside the temple was an old man, “squatted down, working on the moss.” Tourists passed by him, as did Huang and his family. But Huang suddenly stopped, noticing that the man was tending to the garden with a bamboo tweezer and a bamboo basket with, at most, three tiny pieces of dead moss inside it.\n\n“What are you doing?” Huang asked.\n\n“And, he says he is taking care of his garden,” Huang remembered. After the Nvidia CEO inquired, the man added that he had been working there for almost 30 years.\n\nLooking at his tools, Huang pushed further, wondering how the elderly man was able to tend such a big garden with such small tools. “He said something that is perfect, he said ‘I have plenty of time,’” Huang recalls.\n\n“That's the best career advice I can give you,” Huang says. “Most of the time, I wait for things to come to me. I’m rarely chasing things.”\n\nThe gardener’s words— and Huang’s interpretation—could also be seen as a reference to French Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire, whose satirical novella and masterpiece “Candide” offers the lesson that one must cultivate their own garden and find fulfillment through productive work. The 18th century thought leader would likely have a thing or two to say about the 17th wealthiest person in the world trying to emulate his philosophy. “The comfort of the rich depends upon an abundant supply of the poor,” Voltaire once said.\n\nEven if he claims to not be chasing success, the CEO has found a great deal of it while riding the AI wave. Coming off an incredibly strong quarter, Nvidia has even other business leaders giving them creds.\n\n“These two numbers have never been next to each other in the history of capitalism,” Box CEO Aaron Levie tweeted regarding the company’s released revenue and data-center category’s percentage growth. And Huang has profited immensely off of his company’s achievements, his net worth surging to $90 billion in light of recent stock performance.\n\nLooking back on his long stretch of time at Nvidia and the gardner’s ethos, he offers a kernel of advice—“dedicate yourself to learning all the time, doing the best possible work you can,”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether or not it’s authentic, Huang tells a story of trying to stay grounded and give himself fully to the moment, choosing to go watchless, in part, because of this desire. It might be unlikely that a billionaire executive who is running the new era of tech is truly able to stay at peace, but Huang is attempting to.\n\n“I’m focused on now. I’m enjoying my job,” he said. “I’m the longest running tech CEO in the world. I am largely unemployable now, and thank goodness I enjoyed my job.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Friday, May 24, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)). and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), as well as two micro-cap stocks HF Foods Group Inc. (HFFG) and Blue Dolphin Energy Company (BDCO) The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA has literally become the post child for AI leverage, which can be seen in the company's blockbuster stock marekt performance (+173.9% vs. +134.0% for the chips industry). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+87.0% vs. +44.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nExxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+12.1% vs. +11.9%). The company is a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient capital structure and a track record of prudent capex management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.\r\n\r\nWith a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and the strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company aims to increase its annual share buybacks to $20 billion through 2025.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges loom, notably in the upstream operations, which are susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles. While committed to shareholders, ExxonMobil faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in terms of dividend yield. Reliance on finding economically recoverable reserves and exposure to OPEC production cuts add to uncertainties.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HF Foods have underperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $165.72 million is facing challenges which includes high debt levels, low net profit margins, declining cash flow, and inventory management issues. Dependence on the Asian restaurant market, exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical risks pose concerns.\r\n\r\nThe impact of exiting the chicken processing business and the risks associated with transformation initiatives persist. Nevertheless, HF Foods’ revenues increased 0.6% year over year in first-quarter 2024 despite exiting its chicken processing business in 2023.\r\n\r\nProfitability improved significantly, with net loss narrowing and adjusted EBITDA increasing.

        "content": "The price of a stock matters. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just announced a 10-for-1 stock split as its share price rose above $1,000 for the first time. In announcing the stock split, which will bring the share price down to about $100 a share, the company said that the lower price will make it “more accessible to employees and investors.” Similarly, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) has announced a 50-for-1 stock split after its share price crested above $3,000. Investors often want to avoid the obstacle of shares being too expensive to purchase which is why they hunt for under $50 stocks.\n\nThe high price of a stock can prove to be a barrier to entry for many investors who may not have a lot of capital but want to grow their money nonetheless. The good news is there are plenty of stocks that can be purchased for less than $50. For investors looking to start small, buying shares of great companies at affordable prices is often the best course of action. Here are three under $50 stocks to buy in May 2024.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) 2024 Chevrolet Silverado electric pickup truck at the New York Auto Show. GM stock.\n\nSource: quiggyt4 / Shutterstock.com\n\nDetroit automaker General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) stock is on an upswing. Year-to-date (YTD), GM stock has risen 22%. That brings its 12 month gain to 37%. Despite the rise, investors can still buy shares of General Motors for around $44 each. The stock has been marching higher ever since GM raised its 2024 guidance after beating Wall Street expectations across the board with its first-quarter earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors reported Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.62 versus $2.15 that was expected among analysts. Revenue came in at $43.01 billion compared to $41.92 billion that was estimated. Sales rose 7.6% from a year earlier.\n\nOwing to the strong print, GM raised its guidance, saying it expects earnings of $9 to $10 a share, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9.50 a share. Strong North American sales, particularly of pick-up trucks, is largely responsible for the growth at GM.\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nCanada Goose Holdings (NYSE:GOOS) has seen a big earnings turnaround. The maker of winter parkas saw its stock jump 16% higher after it beat analyst expectations for its financial results. The company beat Wall Street forecasts across the board as its sales recovered in the key markets of China and the U.S. following months of declines. Canada Goose reported EPS of 19 cents CAD versus 7 cents CAD that was forecast among analysts. Revenue totaled $358 million CAD, beating Wall Street expectations of $315.5 million CAD.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe luxury parka maker’s revenue in the entire Asia-Pacific region rose 29.6% in the quarter. In North America, sales grew 24.5% over the previous year after a 14% decline in the previous quarter. Management singled out China as a bright spot, noting that luxury brands are making a comeback in the nation of 1.4 billion people. The strong results come after Canada Goose announced in March of this year that it plans to cut 17% of its global workforce amid a prolonged slowdown in sales of luxury items.\n\nGOOS stock is now up 23% this year, though its shares can be bought for only $14.22 each.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a fast growing tech stock that can be purchased for less than $50, look to Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). Investors can buy PLTR stock for only $21 a share, and the stock has been on a tear, rising 72% over the last 12 months, including a 27% gain since January. The data analytics company continues to post strong financial results that show continued profitability. For Q1 of this year, Palantir announced EPS of 8 cents, matching Wall Street expectations. The company has posted a profit for six consecutive quarters.\n\nRevenue in Q1 totaled $634 million versus estimates of $625 million. Sales were up 21% from a year ago. Earlier this year, Palantir signed a $178 million contract with the American military to develop a next-generation sensor station. The company also ran more than 650 “bootcamps” with prospective customers during Q1, allowing them to get hands-on time with the company’s data analytics technology before deciding to make a purchase.\n\nSince going public in 2020, PLTR stock has increased 128%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Nvidia’s 10-for-1 stock split confirms ‘big tech is going bite-sized’ to lure retail investors—and it might signal more market-beating returns, BofA says",
        "content": "Nvidia shares surged 9% to a record high above $1,000 on Thursday after another blowout earnings report, but the stock is about to get a lot cheaper as the AI chip leader announced a 10-for-1 split that will help retail investors more readily buy its shares.\n\nBank of America analysts, led by Jared Woodward, head of the bank’s research investment committee, described the share split as “another large-cap tech pursuing shareholder-friendly policies” in a Thursday note to clients. Nvidia marks the fourth Magnificent 7 big tech company to announce a stock split since 2022, with Google, Amazon, and Tesla also “all making shares more accessible,” Woodward and his team noted.\n\nWith many big tech companies seeing their share prices top $500 in recent years, something that can limit retail investors’ ability to buy shares, they've been looking to make it easier for non-professional investors to buy in. In other words, “big tech is going bite-sized,” BofA said.\n\nHistory says stock splits are bullish\n\nBofA’s sell-side analysts have long been bullish on shares of Nvidia, and they once again hiked their lofty 12-month price target for the chip giant after Thursday’s earnings release—this time from $1,100 to $1,320. Nvidia shares could surge another 26% if the outlook proves prescient, and the stock split might help with that bullish move, according to Bank of America’s reading of history.\n\n“Splits have boosted returns in every decade including the early 2000s when the S&P 500 struggled,” Woodward and his team explained.\n\nSpecifically, Bank of America’s research shows that stocks have managed 25% total returns in the 12 months after a stock split historically, compared to 12% for the S&P 500.\n\nBank of America also noted that stock splits even manage to spark bull runs in stocks that have been struggling. They gave the example of the chip company AMD and the oil-refining giant Valero, both of which saw their share prices surge after announcing stock splits, despite a poor performance prior to the split. “Since gains are more common and larger than losses on average, splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets,” the analysts added.\n\nHowever, channeling the Securities and Exchange Commission here, it’s important to add the caveat that all mutual funds are required to tell investors by law: “past performance is not indicative of future results.”\n\nBank of America was also quick to note that “outperformance is no guarantee” after a stock split. Companies that announce stock splits still see negative returns 30% of the time, and when they do, the average drop is a sizable 22% over the following 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\n“While splits could be an indication of strong momentum, companies can struggle in a challenging macro environment,” the analysts noted. “Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked.”\n\nStill, the vast majority of Wall Street analysts remain bullish on shares of Nvidia—the company boasts 48 “buy” ratings, eight “overweight” ratings, six “hold” ratings, and zero “sell” ratings, according to the Wall Street Journal. And Huang’s announcement that Nvidia will develop another new AI chip within the next 12 months because the company is now on a “one-year rhythm” of development was also just the news bulls wanted to hear.\n\nAs Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, a noted Nvidia bull, put it in a Thursday note: “The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another masterpiece quarter and guidance that should be hung in the Louvre.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Snowflake Provides A Sigh Of Relief But Only Thanks To Strong AI Product Demand",
        "content": "Snowflake Provides A Sigh Of Relief But Only Thanks To Strong AI Product Demand\n\nAfter the bell on Wednesday, Snowflake Inc (NYSE: SNOW) missed first quarter profit expectations while revenue surpassed estimates thanks to strong AI product demand. However, to Wall Street’s delight, the cloud storage provided guided for second-quarter product revenue above Wall Street estimates and raised its expectations for the year, riding the AI hype wave.\n\nFiscal First Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter that ended on April 30th, Snowflake reported that revenue grew 33% YoY to $828.7 million, while product revenue alone rose 34% YoY to $789.6 million, both surpassing Wall Street estimates. Revenue retention rate was 128%, down from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 151% and January quarter's 131%.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share dropped 6% YoY to 14 cents, which was below analyst estimates.\n\nA boosted outlook still implies a margin deceleration.\n\nTo the delight of Wall Street, Snowflake lifted its product revenue guidance for fiscal 2025. For the year that runs from February 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025, Snowflake guided for product revenue of $3.3 billion, lifting its prior forecast of $3.25 billion.  However, Snowflake shales its full year operating income outlook, as non-GAAP operating margins are now expected to be 3%, down from previously guided 6% and actual last year’s 8%.\n\nFor the second quarter, product revenue that makes the most of sales is expected in the range from $805 million to $810 million surpassing LSEG’s average estimate of $785 million.\n\nMore collaborations on the horizon, Nvidia included.\n\nOn Wednesday, Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said that Snowflake would be collaborating further with AI chip giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In an interview on CNBC, Ramaswamy noted that Snowflake and Nvidia have already collaborated on several fronts, with many more to come. Back in April, Snowflake and Nvidia announced the expansion of their partnership to empower enterprises with an AI platform. Together, Snowflake and Nvidia will combine the full-stack NVIDIA accelerated platform with the trusted data foundation and secure AI of Snowflake’s Data Cloud.\n\nWhile stating that the demand for its Cortex AI platform and Iceberg tables is already strong, Ramaswamy also added that Snowflake would be discussing AI and new products at its Data Cloud Summit conference next month. Back in April, Snowflake launched Snowflake Arctic, a large language model that draws from big amounts of text to generate responses to queries. Snowflake Arctic is optimized for complex workloads of enterprises.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe data cloud analytics company also announced its plans to acquire technology assets and hire 35 employees froman AI observability platform. TruEra sells software that enables developers to evaluate and monitor apps that use large language models and other AI tools.\n\nAll in all, Snowflake showed its core business is very strong but while revenue growth topped expectations, updated full-year guidance shows expected margins are still moving in the wrong direction. But, slightly higher product growth from previously expected 22% to 24% YoY does indicate Snowflake is, at the very least, starting to somewhat stabilize after a rough quarter.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "4 Solid Crypto Stocks to Bet on Ahead of Next Bitcoin Rally",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in April after a robust 2023 and first quarter. The first quarter saw Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, hitting an all-time high of $73,750.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has since retreated sharply, with its price hovering around $68,000 on May 23. In fact, Bitcoin has fallen 15% since hitting an all-time high on Mar 14.\n\nOne of the major reasons behind the decline is the recently concluded halving event, which takes place once in four years. The halving event cuts the block reward by half, aiming to limit Bitcoin's total supply to 21 million coins. As a result, the reduced rate of new Bitcoin issuance typically leads to increased demand for the cryptocurrency, which in turn tends to drive up its price.\n\nAlso, Wall Street suffered in April after a first-quarter rally, as concerns grew over rising inflation. This led to the optimism surrounding rate cuts fading fast as investors feared that the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates higher for a longer period.\n\nHigh interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained 54% after increasing 207% in 2023. The halving event has also concluded.\n\nAlso, the cryptocurrency has jumped more than 50% since the launch of the first Bitcoin ETFs in early January.\n\nThe minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Apr-30-May 1 meeting of the FOMC revealed that several officials are in favor of hiking interest rates if the need arises, as inflation is still above its 2% target.\n\nHowever, recent economic data showed that inflation declined in April after increasing in the first quarter. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.3% month over month in April, which was lower than economists’ expectations of a rise of 0.4%. Year over year, CPI rose 3.4%.\n\nAlso, UJS GDP grew only 1.6% in the first quarter after expanding 3.4% in the final quarter of 2023. Besides, retail sales remained flat in April after increasing 0.3% in March, while manufacturing and services activity also slowed last month.\n\nThese signs of a slowing economy have raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could soon start interest rate cuts, which would help the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Meme stocks are back in the big leagues, spurred by the return of Keith Gill, known as ‘Roaring Kitty.’ Many of the original meme stock plays, like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC), which went parabolic in 2021, soared over 70%. Many would feel that renewed interest in meme stocks to buy echoes the 2021 frenzy when retail traders effectively reshaped markets.\n\nTo be fair, the current meme stock rally which started on Monday, has mostly fizzled out. Thus, equating the sustained impact of the original meme stock rally with the current surge misses the mark. However, the renewed enthusiasm in stocks with a strong online backing points to lucrative opportunities for savvy investors.\n\nIn this article, though, we’ll be taking a different approach. The spotlight is on meme stocks to buy with real substance, drawing massive attention to Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) via the ApeWisdom tool.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominated headlines leading up to its first-quarter (Q1) earnings print and didn’t disappoint. It delivered an eye-watering revenue of $26 billion, a 262.2% year-over-year (YOY) increase, beating estimates by $1.45 billion. Data center sales, in particular, surged 427% YOY and roughly 23% sequentially. Moreover, its non-GAAP EPS of $6.12 blew past estimates by 54 cents. Looking ahead, the firm expects to generate $28 billion in sales during the second-quarter (Q2), a 101% increase from the prior-year period.\n\nThat’s not all, though, as the AI chip giant announced a massive 150% quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share. Additionally, it announced a ten-for-one forward stock split, which would have NVDA stock trading at around $95 at current prices.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Nvidia’s Q1 results provided plenty to unpack over its dominance in the AI chip market. It commands roughly 80% of the market, and its peers are merely contending for what remains. Moreover, with it expected to dish out new products like the Blackwell GPU, it would be rather foolish to bet against the stock.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a big-name retailer trading at a deep discount. LULU stock is trading roughly 42% behind its 52-week highs, buffeted by economic challenges dampening its domestic sales. Consequently, the stock trades around 4.25 times forward sales estimates, 45% higher than its 5-year average.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe athletic apparel and sneaker producer has witnessed a marked slowdown in U.S. sales, resulting in a lackluster full-year top-and-bottom-line projection. Moreover, it disclosed plans to close its Washington state distribution center while cutting 100 jobs. Despite its challenges, investors have gotten too spooked by its current woes.\n\nOn the bright side, it beat estimates on both lines for the eighth-consecutive quarter, including its latest earnings print. Additionally, international sales jumped by 54% YOY, with sales in China alone climbing to 78%. Turning to analyst projections, Wall-Street analysts assign a ‘moderate buy’ rating to the stock, with more than a 54% upside from current prices.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood's mobile app logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. Robinhood stocks. HOOD stock\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of social trading platform Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) have been on fire over the past year. HOOD stock surged more than 124% last year and an even better 139% in the past six months. A vibrant crypto rally and favorable stock market dynamics have propelled HOOD stock to multi-year highs. Moreover, given the likelihood of interest rate cuts later this year, expect more upside for HOOD stock.\n\nFurthermore, Robinhood is far from being just a one-trick pony. Though much of its success is linked to its strength in crypto markets, its expansion into other fintech verticals makes it a more comprehensive financial services provider. More specifically, it’s looking to venture into retirement accounts, expand its trading options, and recently launched a Gold credit card. The card has attracted more than a million waitlist sign-ups, with a 42% YOY increase in subscribers.\n\nMoreover, following another blowout quarterly result, Bank of America Securities analyst Craig Siegenthaler upgraded HOOD stock to a ‘buy’ from ‘underperform.’ The notable double-upgrade was driven by heightened retail engagement, enhanced organic growth, and the platform’s positive operational leverage following sizable cost reductions. It is one of the best meme stocks to buy, in my opinion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Chip Crisis Escalates: 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Sell on 50% China Tariffs",
        "content": "Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economic powerhouses, the United States and China, resume. The Biden Administration has chosen to not only continue with Trump-era economic policy that has pitted the two countries against one another but also sought to intensify matters. In an announcement that came out in mid-May, the current administration announced a new package of tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. The 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) consumed the space of most headlines, but this article is focused on the semiconductor piece. The tariff rate on Chinese-made semiconductor products will rise from 25% to 50%, hurting many semiconductor stocks to sell.\n\nIn their fact sheet, the Biden Administration outlined their concerns about Chinese semiconductor products absorbing 50% of the world’s capacity, particularly for “legacy wafers.” The fact sheet also highlighted the administration’s goal to reshore semiconductor manufacturing to the United States. While analysts are mixed about the long-term success of these tariffs, there are several semiconductor stocks to sell that will take a hit from them. Below are just three of them.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company. Semiconductor Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of America’s largest and most significant semiconductor firms. The company designs and manufactures central processing units that are not only critical for laptops and desktops but also for powering data centers that have become so crucial to people’s consumption and usage of the internet. Unfortunately, Intel has come under fire due to recent export controls and tariffs directed towards China. For example, Huawei released the MateBook X Pro, which was the tech firm’s first AI-powered laptop leveraging an Intel CPU. U.S. regulatory agencies reacted quickly and revoked Intel’s export license for these kinds of chips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOutside of selling chips to certain Chinese companies, Intel is also at risk of the increased tariffs. Intel does own manufacturing facilities inside of China and in their most recent SEC filing Form-10K, the semiconductor firm notes that “geopolitical and trade tensions between the US and China, one of our largest markets, have led to increased tariffs and trade restrictions, including tariffs applicable to some of our products.”\n\nHow these new tariffs will impact the pricing of Intel’s products (and which ones) is unknown at this point. What is clear is that these tariffs will have a negative impact on this and other semiconductor stocks to sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is another legacy semiconductor firm based in the United States. While math students might know them for their calculators, this semiconductor firm particularly specializes in designing and manufacturing analog and embedded devices. I’ve been cautious in the past about investing in this legacy business. It’s not clear if Texas Instruments can successfully expand into rapid growth markets like AI or cloud computing, and the firm’s revenue growth in recent years has been volatile, to say the least.\n\nA solid quarterly report released in late April coupled with a higher-than-expected revenue forecast have injected some enthusiasm into investors. Despite the optimism, Texas Instruments is another company that could be impacted by the increase in semiconductor tariffs. The company identifies tariffs and escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China as risks for the marketability of its products. Last year, 20% of the company’s revenue came from China specifically. Escalating trade tensions as well as the rise of China’s domestic semiconductor industry could put Texas Instrument’s China business at significant risk.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) specializes in designing and selling a variety of memory products. This includes NAND flash memory as well as random-access-memory (RAM) products including, SRAM and DRAM. Demand for artificial intelligence-enabling chips has led to subsequent demand for sophisticated memory chips. In particular, Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips will be a key component to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips.\n\nHowever, geopolitical headwinds are in the company’s midst. Not only have U.S. officials restricted Micron’s ability to sell certain chips to Chinese firms, but China has also slapped back with an effective ban on Micron’s products for firms working on key infrastructure products. While these new 50% tariffs on China’s semiconductor products will likely not affect Micron directly, the precipitous rise in tensions will. The rise of China’s Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) and ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) are just a taste of some of the unintended consequences of trade escalations. These could be bad for MU shares in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Here’s Why Jim Cramer is Bearish on Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA)",
        "content": "Insider Monkey recently published a list of 7 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish On. Under Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA) ranks second in that list. Since Under Armour is a popular name among both hedge funds and retail investors, it deserver a detailed look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program yet again lamented over the market's obsession about the Fed's stance over sticky inflation, saying the latest Fed minutes from April 30 to May 1 spooked investors because the central bank officials seem to be getting \"impatient\" with the inflation's slower-than-expected decline.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that economic data released after these Fed minutes showed that the labor market as well as inflation are cooling, exactly what the Fed wants. Cramer said had the Fed officials seen this data before, their minutes would have been different.\n\nCramer said that the Fed needs to know that their \"inflation lamentation\" from three weeks ago isn’t necessary.\n\nJim Cramer said that consumer spending has been the biggest issue for the Federal Reserve as they wonder, \"is they any place that's too high for them (consumers).\" Cramer acknowledged that without putting brakes on consumer spending it'd be impossible to beat inflation.\n\nHowever, the CNBC host said that if Fed officials had paid attention they'd have found that they are \"finally\" winning their battle against consumer spending too.\n\nJim Cramer said there are \"nascent signs\" showing that the consumers are finally saying \"enough is enough.\" Cramer pointed to Walmart's latest numbers as a sign of consumers' preference for discount retailers. Cramer said Walmart is one of the few companies offering value in budget.\n\n\"The Consumer Has Had Enough\"\n\n\"After years of seemingly endless price increases, the consumer has had enough. Consumers are now staying more at home.\"\n\nJim Cramer also highlighted latest comments from Kevin Hourican, the CEO of Sysco, which supplies food products to restaurants. Hourican said that the industry needs to do \"something\" about the rising prices that are affecting foot traffic at restaurants.\n\nJim Cramer thinks a \"consumer rebellion\" is happening in the industry which has executives scratching their heads.\n\nAnother sign of this rebellion, according to Cramer, is major companies like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) rolling out budget options. Cramer said that consumers also has had enough of price increases at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), and the company needed these budget menu offerings to increase traffic.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cramer is bullish on stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), he's recommending investors to stay away from UAA. Let's see why.\n\nUnder Armour Inc Class A (NYSE:UAA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nJim Cramer recently said in a program that he's a \"huge supporter\" of Kevin Plank, Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) founder and CEO.  However, he said he's not a supporter of the stock. That's because, according to Cramer, the competition in the athletic apparel industry is very high. Cramer said he's sure if Kevin Plank goes to another industry he'd be \"crushing it\" but in this industry you have to compete with major players like Nike and New Balance.\n\n\"These are just serious competitors and you've got to be on your game every second.\"\n\nWall Street analysts are also questioning Under Armour Inc Class A's (NYSE:UAA) future following downbeat fiscal Q4 results. J.P.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Dominate in the Next Economic Upturn",
        "content": "If you’re wondering which stocks to buy for the next economic upturn, you’re in the right place. Finding profitable investment opportunities in the constantly changing global economy is crucial to profiting from the next economic boom. These seven exceptional stocks with solid growth potential and tactical advantages may lead in their respective industries.\n\nThe first one stands out as a strong competitor in the financial industry because of its steady revenue growth and sensible diversification tactics. Driven by strong demand for its cutting-edge GPUs, the second semiconductor company in the market has seen outstanding growth in its data center division.\n\nMeanwhile, the third one is notable for its adaptability and effectiveness in AI applications, and a significant portion of its income comes from AI inference. With its strategic connection to new market trends like the business refresh cycle and AI PCs, the fourth one has a promising future. The sixth one leads on its successful marketing and positive financial outlook; the seventh has its strategic efforts and potential for future growth. Finally, the fifth one has solid financial standing and an emphasis on innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: SoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, adjusted net revenue for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) increased by 26% year-over-year (YOY) to $581 million. It is the 12th straight quarter of a boost of more than 25%. Such stable growth highlights the business’s revenue-generating solid capacities and long-term growth sustainability.\n\nMoreover, SoFi’s fundamental advantage is the diversity of its top-line. In Q1, the combined sectors of financial services and technology platforms held 42% of the adjusted net revenue, up from 33% and 40% in the prior quarters. As reflected in this trend, by 2024’s end, it may attain a nearly equal revenue distribution between these segments and loans, pointing to a strategy move in that direction.\n\nFinally, in Q1, SoFi’s adjusted EBITDA was $144 million, a 91% YOY increase. This growth reflects significant operating leverage, as the EBITDA margin increased to 25% from 16% during Q1 2023. Therefore, the company’s operations are now more scalable and cost-effective.\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Data Center division of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) saw record sales of $2.3 billion, up 2% sequentially and 80% YOY. Instinct MI300X GPU sales acceleration and a double-digit percentage gain in server CPU sales propelled growth. AMD increased its revenue share from server CPUs, especially in cloud and business installations. Indeed, these numbers demonstrate AMD’s dominant position in the data center industry. This is the result of its creative products and calculated market penetration.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the client segment expansion results from a $1.4 billion increase in sales, or 85% YOY. This is driven by the most recent generation of Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. These have seen double-digit growth in desktop Ryzen CPUs and nearly a doubling of sales of mobile Ryzen CPUs YOY. Overall, AMD’s Ryzen CPUs are in high demand, and the client segment has had remarkable growth, demonstrating the success of its product plans.\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: NVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Data Center business area for NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be the engine driving its growth trajectory. This segment’s record sales of $22.6 billion in Q1 2024 were a 427% YOY growth. The main force driving this increase is the broad deployment of the Nvidia Hopper GPU computing platform and AI inference by major cloud providers, businesses, and consumer internet firms.\n\nMoreover, companies like Meta (NASDAQ:META) have invested heavily in Nvidia’s AI infrastructure. Developed on a cluster of 24K H100 GPUs, Meta’s Llama 3 delivers new AI-driven features that increase user engagement and open up new income sources for the company.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has a lot of room to develop in the automotive industry, especially with its AI infrastructure supporting autonomous driving technology. An excellent example is Nvidia’s partnership with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The company powers Tesla’s FSD Version 12 autonomous driving software with its AI infrastructure. In short, Tesla’s installation of 35K H100 GPUs highlights how important Nvidia’s technology is to advancing autonomous car capabilities.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the main factors influencing Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) development potential is its leadership in technology and placement in rising industry trends. Strong future demand for AI PCs is reflected in the projected Enterprise refresh cycle and increased momentum for these devices. This trend is supported by Intel’s expertise in creating and managing the AI PC category and the growing availability of AI PC CPUs.\n\nMoreover, an improvement in the data center industry indicates the return to more regular CPU purchasing patterns and the increasing availability of accelerators. This solidifies the impending release of Intel 18A products.\n\nFurther, Intel anticipates growth in both EPS and sales for 2024, with H2 2024 seeing an acceleration in revenue growth. Strategic measures and rising demand signals underpin this optimistic forecast. Intel’s commitment to providing value is reflected in the announcement of a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share, boosting the Street’s confidence. Despite large expenditures in technology and capacity growth, Intel expects considerable capital offsets in H2 2024, resulting in about neutrally adjusted free cash flow for 2024.\n\nStocks to Buy for Next Economic Upturn: ACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q1 2024, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) had $288 million in time deposits and cash. With that, the company has the flexibility to take advantage of growth leads, control operational risks, and deal with market adversities. Operating income increased to $39.8 million in Q1 2024 from $10.9 million in Q1 2023. There is an increase in operating income and a boost in operating margin from 14.7% to 26.2%. This demonstrates the company’s capacity to translate revenue growth into profitability sharply.\n\nFurther, research and development expenses went from $13.3 million to $19.4 million. This boost demonstrates ACM Research’s dedication to innovation and creating new goods to maintain its competitive advantage. The corporation must prioritize research and development to meet market demands and maintain long-term growth.\n\nOverall, ACM Research’s edge reflects its ongoing development of cutting-edge packaging tools, its successful qualification of the Ultra C v Vacuum Cleaning Tool, and its advancements in developing the Track and Plasma Enhanced chemical vapor deposition platforms. As a result, these advances are anticipated to drive top-line growth and market expansion.\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nHims & Hers (NYSE:HIMS) excels in marketing efficiency, taking a leading position in this crucial area. Compared to Q1 2023, marketing costs as a proportion of sales increased by nearly 4%, reaching 47% in Q1 2024. Better targeting and more successful marketing techniques are reflected in this development. This allows the business to sign up new members for less money. The company has a solid strategy for developing its brand. Hence, this has been effective and centered on connecting with customers at different culturally significant times and early in their health journeys.\n\nLooking forward, Hims & Hers has given upbeat predictions for the balance of 2024. The business projects $292 million to $297 million in sales for Q2, with $30 million to $35 million in adjusted EBITDA. Similarly, the top-line may range from $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion in 2024, while adjusted EBITDA will fall between $120 million and $135 million.\n\nIn short, these estimates further support the company’s excellent financial standing and growth leads. As a result, this shows ongoing robust growth and enhanced profitability.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock’s (NYSE:SQ) improvement in profitability may be attributed to strategic efficiency efforts and careful expenditure control. The corporation achieved leverage on corporate overhead expenditures and concluded the quarter with a staff below its cap of 12K employees. Block has kept up its growth momentum by taking these steps and improving its cost structure.\n\nAdditionally, Block intends to invest in high-yield fields like marketing and sales to propel further expansion. These efforts will increase market penetration overall, user acquisition, and brand visibility. In light of the solid Q1 results, Block has increased its gross profit and profitability outlook for 2024. The company has upbeat forecasts for the remainder of 2024.\n\nAt the bottom line, a gross profit of at least $8.78 billion, or a 17% YOY increase, is included in the revised guidance. A minimum of $1.3 billion adjusted operating income, or 15% of total profit, is required. Overall, the company’s mark in maintaining its growth trajectory and attaining increased profitability is reflected in these predictions.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in SOFI, AMD, NVDA, INTC and ACMR.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "Recent conferences have shown that the pace of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation is accelerating. Given this continued progress in the field, AI stocks to buy will perform well going forward.\n\nOver the past month, a series of AI conferences have highlighted innovations in the space. First, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) made AI announcements at Google’s annual developers conference. It outlined updates to DeepMind and Gemini and unveiled new features leveraging AI like Ask Photos, AI Overviews and Imagen 3.\n\nOther AI leaders are also rapidly innovating as this space heats up. Indeed, OpenAI attempted to upstage Google by releasing its latest model, GPT-4o, before the Google Conference. And, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) followed up with its Copilot+ PCs announcement on May 20.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll these announcements bode well for investments in the compute and data layers. Semiconductor companies are designing advanced chips to solve AI compute. Meanwhile, other players are solving data problems and building applications on large language models. These AI stocks to buy are already central to AI infrastructure and will play a key role going forward.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has rallied over 90% year-to-date (YTD). Despite the substantial gain, it remains one of the AI stocks to buy, given the exposure to the AI server market. Furthermore, an upgrade cycle of laptops and PCs to AI-powered ones could be a key catalyst.\n\nThe primary driver for DELL stock is the growing demand in the AI server market. Alongside Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), it is one of the key players in this market. On that note, Evercore ISI believes it has won a substantial contract to supply Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with AI servers.\n\nDue to the soaring AI server demand, analysts are bullish. Dell Technologies exited Q4 fiscal year 2024 with a $2.9 billion backlog. Based on growing demand, analysts at Bernstein think AI server revenues could exceed $9 billion in fiscal year 2025.\n\nAnother catalyst for Dell Technologies will be an upgrade cycle triggered by the launch of AI PCs. Anticipating the opportunity, Dell Technologies has launched a comprehensive portfolio of Copilot+ AI PCs. Furthermore, it will profit as partners like Microsoft introduce their versions of AI PCs.\n\nRegarding valuation, DELL stock is still one of the best AI stocks to buy. At under 19 times forward EPS, there is significant upside.\n\nMicron Technologies (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThis memory maker is also soaring on the demand from AI. Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) is famous for its non-volatile flash memory (NAND) and Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) offerings. However, its innovation in high bandwidth memory makes it one of the top AI stocks to buy.\n\nIndeed, HBM has emerged as a key component in AI chipset architectures. In this area, Micron Technologies has emerged as a leader with superior technology. The memory chip producer is applying thermos-compression nonconducting film technology that has improved thickness consistency, packing density and spacing.\n\nIts latest HBM3E memory is seeing significant demand and gaining market share against competitors like SK Hynix and Samsung. Furthermore, due to constrained capacity, pricing will be favorable going forward. Already, Micron Technology has started producing HBM3E chips and management has stated that they will be sold out for 2024 and most of 2025. Moreover, due to the tight prices, they think prices could move higher.\n\nSo far, demand is positively impacting results. Results for Q2 of fiscal year 2024 showed revenues rose 58% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.82 billion. Moreover, management raised the Q3 guide to $6.6 billion above the $6 billion consensus. Indeed, the fundamental momentum is in full swing, and MU stock is a top AI stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the major alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI GPU market, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) remains one of the top AI stocks to buy. It’s a compelling buying opportunity after a pullback from above $220 to below $180.\n\nSo, what’s the bull case for AMD stock? The semiconductor company is seeing soaring demand for its MI300 AI accelerators. Management expects to achieve at least $4 billion in AI accelerator sales in the calendar year 2024.\n\nHowever, this accounts for just 3% of the market share. According to Bloomberg, the AI training and inference market will grow from $94 billion in 2024 to $640 billion by 2032, representing a 27% compounded annual growth rate. So, analysts expect sustained revenue growth and market share gains from a relatively smaller base compared to Nvidia.\n\nFurthermore, Advanced Micro Devices will profit from the transition to AI PCs. Microsoft recently announced its AI PCs and highlighted the chip maker as one of its partners. This means that its chips for desktops and laptops will experience growing demand.\n\nIn summary, AMD stock has two AI opportunities: in the data center and through AI PCs. At 10 times forward sales, it trades at a significant discount to Nvidia’s 20 times and is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When we think about the major indexes, we usually think of the NASDAQ, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But if you want a full picture of the US stock market, you should also include the Russell 2000. This is the index that holds 2000 of the top American small-cap stocks, and sifting through it can be incredibly beneficially to finding small-cap gems to round out your portfolio. Likely, you have probably seen it mentioned by its ticker symbol IWM, which is the ETF that tracks the index. \r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar or still apprehensive about IWM, it is worth noting that in his most recent 13 F, Stanley Druckenmiller, considered to be one of the greatest investors ever, disclosed a bullish position in IWM call options with a notional value of $664 million. In other words, he thinks small-caps are about to rip higher! For investors looking to get a piece of this growth, here are three stocks from the Russell 2000 worth considering in May 2024!\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been one of the hottest chip stocks in 2024. The company has enjoyed its close relationship with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the surge in AI chips and infrastructure demand. Analyst price targets are all over the map for this stock, ranging from $285.00 to over $1500.00. Overall though, the average price target of $1,057.46 confidently represents a near 20% upside from today’s price.\n\nSo far in 2024, shareholders of SMCI have seen a return of a whopping 211%. Given that Wall Street expects AI demand to be a global secular trend for the next decade, it’s easy to see why stocks like SMCI are getting love from investors. After all, SMCI’s high-performance server and storage solutions have been crucial in powering cloud computing, enterprise data centers, 5G computing, and more!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter gaining over 200% this year, many investors might think SMCI is overvalued. Surprisingly, the stock trades at just 4.3x sales and 24.5x forward earnings. It has also grown its net income at a CAGR of 70% over the past five years and a staggering 126% over the past three. With new products such as GB200 set to to continue expanding SMCI’s rack-scale plug-and-play as well, investors can be confident that SMCI will continue being in demand!\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK) In this photo illustration, the CleanSpark (CLSK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) is a Bitcoin mining company making headlines this year. As the crypto bull run continues, CleanSpark and other miners should benefit from a renewed interest in Bitcoin. Analysts are bullish too. Currently, Wall Street’s lowest price target is $20.00, about 25% higher than today’s price. The highest price target? A whopping $30.00 nearly 100% higher than the current price of $16.03.\n\nStory continues\n\nA lot of people see the word crypto and run. However, Bitcoin has managed to transcend the barriers of traditional finance to make real-world applications thanks to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs this year. While many critics say Bitcoin mining still poses threats to the environment, CleanSpark has been pioneering a path toward more sustainable solutions. Already, for example, its mining operations have been 90% powered by carbon-free power sources!\n\nShares of CLSK trade at about 9.2x sales and 30.8x forward earnings, in line with other major Bitcoin miners. With Bitcoin potentially targeting $100,000 this year, Cleanspark offers investors a cheap, and environmentally friendly way to jump in on this hot crypto bull rally.\n\nMagnite (MGNI) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMagnite (NASDAQ:MGNI) is a sell-side advertisement tech platform that joined the Russell 2000 in 2022. According to Wall Street price targets, the stock is currently heavily undervalued. The lowest price target for MGNI is $13.00 which still represents a 10% upside. Additionally, its highest price target of $20.00 offers more than a 60% upside compared to today’s price.\n\nThe most recent quarter proved to be beneficial for Magnite as the company topped revenue estimates and saw its stock gain more than 10%. But that wasn’t the only catalyst for Magnite. The company announced an exclusive partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as the only sell-side ad company. Analysts expect Netflix to become Magnite’s biggest customer by the end of 2025.\n\nIt hasn’t been an easy couple of years for MGNI shareholders. Luckily, the depressed price has presented a discounted buying opportunity at just 2.5x sales and 11x forward earnings. This, of course, has been accompanied by a strong 37% revenue compound annual growth rate! As Netflix comes on board in mid-2025, investors should look to buy this company before its growth balloons.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past 18 months. Shares jumped sixfold thanks to the crucial role it is playing in the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). But Nvidia has also crushed the broader market by a big margin over the past decade as well.\n\nThe stock has shot up over 20,000% in the past 10 years, with these stunning gains crushing the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's 428% jump by an astronomic margin. With an investment of $5,000 made in the stock a decade ago, Nvidia has become a millionaire-maker. NVDA Chart\n\nNot everyone may be comfortable paying 38 times sales and 55 times earnings for Nvidia stock right now, even though it may be able to justify that expensive valuation because of a huge total addressable market worth $1 trillion. Investors looking to buy attractively valued stocks that could make them richer in the long run should instead consider Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Oracle(NYSE: ORCL).\n\nThese companies are not only significantly cheaper than Nvidia, but they are on track to benefit from a couple of massive growth opportunities that could send their share prices soaring over the long term. Let's look at the reasons Meta and Oracle could be ideal picks for investors hoping to construct a million-dollar portfolio.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms stock shot up 92% in the past year, and the company's recent quarterly report indicates that it is built for more upside because of its accelerating growth. The social media giant's first-quarter revenue increased 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, while adjusted earnings shot up 114% year over year to $4.71 per share.\n\nMeta's impressive year-over-year growth was driven by a solid 20% year-over-year jump in ad impressions, as well as a 6% jump in the average price of each ad. AI is playing an important role in driving stronger growth in Meta's ad business by delivering relevant content to users across its family of apps, which is in turn driving an increase in the number of relevant ads served to its users.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings conference call that its AI recommendation system accounts for 30% of the posts that are delivered to the Facebook feeds of its users, while more than 50% of the content on Instagram is recommended by AI. It is worth noting that Meta has been continuously introducing AI-related tools for advertisers, making it easier for them to create and optimize ad campaigns.\n\nThe company will be rolling out more generative AI tools as the year progresses to help advertisers improve the performance of their ads and allow them to boost the returns on the ad dollars that they spend. The good part is that advertisers are already reaping the benefits of Meta's AI tools. In January this year, a Meta executive said that AI is driving a 32% increase in returns on advertising spending for advertisers while helping them reduce acquisition costs by 17%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased upon this performance, Meta Platforms is forecasting another quarter of solid growth. The company expects Q2 revenue to land at $37.8 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be an 18% jump over the year-ago period when it reported 11% top-line growth. Even better, analysts are forecasting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 30% for the next five years, which would be an acceleration over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Meta delivering such impressive growth as AI is helping it corner a bigger share of the digital ad market. Digital ad spending is forecasted to grow 13.2% in 2024, and Meta's Q1 growth and Q2 forecast tells us that it is growing at a faster pace than the end market. More importantly, digital ad spending is expected to increase at an annual rate of 14.5% through 2030, according to KBV Research, generating an annual revenue of just over $1 trillion.\n\nMeta generated $143 billion in revenue in the past 12 months, which means that it still has a lot of room for growth in the future. Investors would do well to buy Meta stock while it is trading at 27 times trailing earnings, which is significantly lower than Nvidia's trailing earnings multiple. Its stronger earnings growth could reward investors with more upside.\n\n2. Oracle\n\nThe demand for cloud-based AI services has been booming as companies across the globe are looking to develop AI applications, and this has turned out to be a boon for Oracle. The company, which made its name by providing database software, is now witnessing solid growth in its cloud computing business.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Feb. 29, 2024), Oracle reported a 25% year-over-year increase in cloud revenue to $5.1 billion. The segment's growth outpaced the company's overall revenue increase of 7% to $13.3 billion. More specifically, the demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure shot up and its revenue from this niche jumped 49% year over year to $1.8 billion.\n\nThe good thing for Oracle investors is that AI has helped the company build a healthy revenue pipeline. This was evident from the 29% year-over-year increase in the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) last quarter, a metric that refers to the total value of future contracts that Oracle has to fulfill. The fact that this metric increased at a faster pace than Oracle's revenue is a positive sign.\n\nOracle pointed out that it has been \"receiving large contracts reserving cloud infrastructure capacity because the demand for our Gen2 AI infrastructure substantially exceeds supply.\" The company has been bringing new cloud data centers online very rapidly to cater to the healthy demand that it has been witnessing, so it won't be surprising to see the company's cloud AI-focused revenue pipeline improving further in the future.\n\nThe cloud AI market is forecasted to grow at an annual rate of 31% through the end of the decade, generating an annual revenue of $398 billion at the end of the forecast period, according to Fortune Business Insights. As a result, there is a good chance that Oracle's growth could accelerate over the long run. Analysts, for instance, are expecting Oracle's earnings growth to accelerate over the next couple of years as compared to the $5.12 per share in earnings it delivered in fiscal 2023. ORCL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nConsidering that Oracle is currently trading at 6.6 times sales and 20 times forward earnings, investors can buy it at a much cheaper valuation compared to Nvidia. That could turn out to be a smart move -- the terrific opportunity for Oracle in the cloud AI market could translate into stronger earnings growth in the long run and lead the market to reward the stock with more gains. Investors wanting to add a cloud stock to their portfolios that could help them attain their goal of becoming millionaires would do well to buy Oracle right away.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Generative AI Software Sales Could Soar by 6,260% by 2032: 1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy Before They Do (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has gone viral since early last year, and it's easy to see why. This next-generation software can create original content, including text, video, and images, from just a few prompts. The technology also promises to revolutionize business by streamlining processes and increasing productivity.\n\nAs the primary maker of the high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computing power that underpins this groundbreaking technology, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the earliest beneficiaries of the accelerating adoption of generative AI. The company's revenue has grown by more than 100% year over year for three successive quarters, and another quarter of similar growth is on the way.\n\nHowever, investors are beginning to look beyond hardware to the wave of AI software adoption to follow, and with good reason. According to a forecast by Bloomberg Intelligence, generative AI software sales are expected to surge to $318 billion by 2032, up 6,260% from just $5 billion last year.\n\nWhile Nvidia will undoubtedly continue to prosper, another company is also well positioned to benefit from the AI software revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe godfather of AI software\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) first rose to prominence by providing the U.S. government and its allies with AI software to help ferret out terrorists before they could strike. More recently, however, the company has focused its AI expertise and data analytics prowess on helping businesses make data-driven decisions that lead to more successful outcomes.\n\nBecause it had decades of experience in the field, Palantir was able to quickly develop generative AI solutions when the technology evolved. The fruit of that labor is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nMany businesses would love to integrate AI into their operations, but simply don't know how. Palantir is solving that problem by holding AIP \"bootcamps.\" The company describes these as \"immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions [that] allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations.\" This helps businesses \"go from zero to use case in just one to five days.\" Palantir goes on to note, \"We have a growing backlog of AIP Bootcamps due to the overwhelming demand.\"\n\nIn October, the company set a goal of hosting 500 AIP bootcamps over the coming year, but demand has been off the charts. In the first quarter alone, the company conducted 660 bootcamps, and the backlog continued to grow. Management cited two instances when companies signed seven-figure deals just days after completing a bootcamp. The company had previously noted that these bootcamps \"significantly compress sales cycles and accelerate the rate of new customer acquisition.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shows that Palantir's bootcamp strategy is a winning one.\n\nShow me the money\n\nThe results are only just beginning to show up in the company's finances. In the first quarter, revenue grew 21% year over year to $634 million, and Palantir has its sixth consecutive quarter of profitability -- but that only tells part of the story. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 40% year over year while customers for the segment grew 69%. Remaining deal revenue -- the remaining value of contracts not yet booked into revenue -- grew by 74%, which suggests its growth spurt will continue.\n\nAs a result, management increased its full-year forecast -- it's now calling for revenue of $2.68 billion, or growth of roughly 20% at the midpoint of its guidance. Due to the strong and ongoing demand, management now expects full-year U.S. commercial revenue of at least $661 million, up 45%. Based on the robust demand, there could be much more to come.\n\nA word on valuation\n\nDespite its accelerating growth and the massive opportunity ahead for the company, Palantir stock won't appeal to every investor. It trades at 179 times earnings and 21 times sales -- valuations that might raise eyebrows. However, those metrics fail to take into account the company's accelerating growth. Its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio clocks in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nThe adoption of generative AI has only just begun, and Palantir has decades of AI experience to bring to bear on the coming competition. Its strategy for bringing AI to the masses is absolutely brilliant and should continue to pay dividends from here. That's why Palantir stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Who Owns the Most Nvidia Stock Besides CEO Jensen Huang?",
        "content": "It should come as no surprise that Jensen Huang is the largest individual shareholder of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). He co-founded the company with friends back in 1993 and currently serves as its president and CEO.\n\nHuang's total stake in Nvidia currently stands at 86,827,600 shares, worth a cool $82.8 billion as of this writing. But who owns the second most shares?\n\nNvidia's largest investors aren't who you'd expect\n\nWhen it comes to current management, CFO Colette Kress owns the second most Nvidia stock. Her 643,148 shares are worth around $613 million. Ajay Puri, the company's executive vice president of worldwide field operations, owns 532,401 shares. That stake is valued at $508 million.\n\nBut outside of the executive team, billionaire venture capitalist Mark Stevens comes out on top. He served as a company director from 1993 to 2006 and has been  a member of the board since 2008. His 4,069,181 shares are worth about $3.9 billion.\n\nBut these aren't Nvidia's largest shareholders if you expand the scope to institutional investors. Roughly two-thirds of the company is held by institutions, versus around 4.3% held by company insiders.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Vanguard Group and BlackRock come out on top with a combined stake of around 400 million shares. That's roughly 15% of the entire company. These two entities are two of the largest money managers in the world, however. Both operate dozens of multibillion-dollar index funds, so their holdings aren't necessarily a pure bet on Nvidia as a stand-alone stock. The top eight funds invested in Nvidia stock are all index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhat happened to Nvidia's other co-founders? One of them, Curtis Priem, gave away most of his shares long ago, meaning he didn't directly benefit from the company's recent meteoric rise. His stake would now be worth $70 billion if he hadn't donated the bulk of it back in the early 2000s.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Is there additional upside for this market darling, or has that train already left the station? Let's examine the evidence. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA long track record of performance\n\nWithout further investigation, it might be easy to conclude that you've already missed your chance with Nvidia, but investors have been making that same mistake for years. One of the keys to the company's continuing success is the ability to find new and innovative ways to adapt its technology. Nvidia's earlier work with machine learning and other branches of AI set the stage for the company's current success with the explosive demand for generative AI.\n\nNvidia's secret sauce is its mastery of parallel processing, or the ability to run a multitude of mathematical computations simultaneously. The company pioneered this technology to generate lifelike images in video games, but it proved equally adept at data center and cloud computing applications and possessed the raw computational horsepower required for the rigors of AI.\n\nMore relevant to the question at hand is that these markets all have potential upside, which could drive Nvidia stock even higher.\n\nThe company's recent financial report provides plenty of evidence to support that contention. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia generated record quarterly revenue of $26 billion, up 262% year over year. The results were primarily driven by its data center segment, including AI, which produced record revenue of $22.6 billion, up 427%. The bounty continued to the bottom line, as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 soared 629%.\n\nFor investors worried that the rally is on its last legs, Nvidia's outlook should dispel concerns. For the second quarter, management is forecasting record revenue of $28 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 107%. Management even announced a stock split to make the skyrocketing share price more affordable. While investors shouldn't expect those triple-digit increases to continue, this clearly shows that Nvidia's growth is far from over.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore room to run\n\nNvidia's two biggest opportunities are generative AI and data centers.\n\nThe adoption of generative AI, while robust, is still in the early stages. Estimates vary wildly regarding the opportunity, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the generative AI market will grow to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in the coming years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. As the leading provider of processors used for AI, Nvidia stands to benefit from this secular tailwind.\n\nFurthermore, the data center industry is in the midst of one of the biggest upgrade cycles ever. Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya estimates that the market will grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the next three years. Nvidia controls an estimated 92% share of the market for GPUs used in data centers, which suggests a long and lucrative road ahead.\n\nThese two markets should continue to fuel Nvidia's growth. This helps illustrate the vast opportunity ahead and why it isn't too late to buy Nvidia stock, even at a new, all-time high.\n\nWhat about the valuation?\n\nThere's no denying Nvidia's steep valuation. It's currently selling for 89 times earnings -- but that requires context.\n\nThe company has already generated four consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth and is guiding for another. The forward-looking numbers are much more reasonable, as Nvidia has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39, though it's still higher than the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500.\n\nBut while the valuation might seem unreasonable at first glance, this really isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. As noted, Nvidia has outperformed the S&P by a factor of 10 over the past decade, so it's earned that premium valuation.\n\nConsidering its track record of performance, its dominant place within the industry, and the magnitude of the opportunity ahead, it's easy to understand why Nvidia stock is still a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement",
        "content": "Alongside its latest earnings results, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10:1 stock split and a 150% dividend raise following the market closed on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia shares, now the ninth most expensive in the S&P 500, opened above $1,000 a day after the print. A 10:1 split would imply a $100/share price, all else being equal, after trading opens on Monday, June 10th.\n\nThis year, eight companies announced stock splits, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in January and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) in March. The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the ‘Magnificent 7’ mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) split in 2020, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are nearing the $500/share threshold.\n\n“S&P 500 stocks with share prices over $500 represent $7.4tn in market cap, or about 16% of the index,” Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday note.\n\nIn their recently updated research, BofA found that stock splits are typically bullish for companies that enact them. On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n“Splits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,” analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA’s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n“Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,” the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures hover around the flatline heading into the final trading day of the week following a dip in the major averages on Thursday. Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) shares slip in extended hours trading as analysts fret over a loss of free users at its key TurboTax service. Ether edges lower amid some profit-taking after U.S. securities regulators approve rule changes supporting the creation of exchange-traded funds tied to the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures were treading water on Friday after equities fell in the prior session despite blowout earnings from artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nBy 03:35 ET (07:35 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract, Nasdaq 100 futures and Dow futures were all mostly unchanged.\n\nThe major averages on Wall Street ended the prior session lower, as enthusiasm over a better-than-expected spike in quarterly revenue from AI chipmaker Nvidia was tempered by data showing that the number of Americans filing for first time job benefits was less than anticipated. The figures pointed to resilience in the U.S. labor market, exacerbating some concerns that Federal Reserve policymakers could delay possible upcoming interest rate reductions.\n\nAt the close of trading on Thursday, the benchmark S&P 500 had shed 0.7%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had slipped by 0.4%, and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 1.5%.\n\n2. Intuit shares slip amid worries over loss of free TurboTax users\n\nIntuit posted fiscal third quarter results that topped analysts expectations, but shares in the group slumped in extended hours trading as investors fretted over a loss of free users at its all-important TurboTax tax-preparation service.\n\nThe firm behind personal finance portal Credit Karma and accounting software QuickBooks announced quarterly earnings per share of $9.88 on revenue of $6.74 billion. The numbers beat Wall Street estimates of $9.38 and $6.65 billion, respectively, in a sign that users were reacting postively to investments in AI and enhanced tax filing services.\n\nHowever, the number of people using TurboTax's free offering during the three months ended on April 30, which includes tax filing season in the U.S., dipped by about 1 million versus the year-ago period. Analysts flagged concerns that TurboTax may be struggling to attract higher-end customers while also facing increased competition for lower-end users.\n\n3. SEC approves applications to list spot Ether ETFs\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved rule changes backing the creation of exchange-traded funds linked to Ether, paving the way for the potential launch of eight such funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday's decision marked some progress towards the eventual approval of a spot ETF for trade, although the SEC has to now engage with applications from fund managers to list a spot ETF. Applicants include VanEck, ARK Investment Management and seven other issuers.\n\nRumblings of the SEC’s approval had boosted Ether prices throughout the week, with the actual event sparking fleeting gains in the token.\n\nOn Friday, Ether, the world's no. 2 digital token, had slipped by 2.8% to $3,684.11 by 03:26 ET amid some profit-taking.\n\n4. Nvidia cuts China AI chip prices - Reuters\n\nNvidia has been pushed into selling artificial intelligence chips in China at heavy discounts due to stiff competition from local players, specifically Huawei, Reuters reported on Friday.\n\nThe California-based firm previously launched three AI chips tailor-made for China last year, as U.S. sanctions prevented it from selling its most advanced AI chips in the country.\n\nAmong the three, the H20, which is the most powerful, has been hit by subdued demand in China, and in some cases, was being sold at an over 10% discount to a similar offering from Huawei, the Reuters report said.\n\nHuawei's Ascend 910B chip was also seeing substantially more orders than the H20 from state-backed enterprises, Reuters said, citing limited government data. This came after a mandate from Beijing for state enterprises to use China-made silicon.\n\n5. Crude heading for weekly falls\n\nCrude prices were lower on Friday, heading for hefty weekly losses as indications of sticky inflation and high interest rates spurred on concerns over economic activity in the U.S., the world's top oil consumer.\n\nBy 03:36 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) had fallen 0.4% to $76.60 per barrel, while the Brent contract had dropped 0.3% to $81.13 a barrel.\n\nBoth contracts were on track to post weekly losses of more than 3%, with Brent at its weakest level in two months, while WTI was at a three-month low.\n\nAll eyes are now on the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together called OPEC+, at the start of June. The group of producers is expected to discuss whether to extend voluntary oil output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures muted, Intuit's free TurboTax users slip - what's moving markets\n\nTake Five: Inflation watch\n\nEuropean stocks set for worst drop in five weeks as rate worries resurface\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 keeps hitting new all-time highs. No longer just a handful of stocks are driving the index higher, this is a broad-based rally. Nearly three-quarters of the index’s components show positive returns this year, though a few Magnificent Seven stocks are doing their part. Not surprisingly, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) leads the way as of this writing with a neat double so far.\n\nAlthough more than a third of the component stocks are in the technology sector some of the best performers are not. Utility stock Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), for example, is the second-best stock in the index. Its stock is up 88% as data center artificial intelligence demand is driving the need for more electricity higher.\n\nThose factors ought to keep stocks already running hot climbing further. The following three all-star companies are Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy now as they have much more room to run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nArguably Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is the better stock to buy now over Nvidia. While the leading chipmaker is seeing explosive growth, it is going to be coming up against hard-to-beat numbers as the year progresses. Nvidia’s growth won’t look so dynamic in the quarters ahead. Not so with Advanced Micro Devices. Its explosive growth is coming.\n\nFor one, a new channel of growth just opened up for it. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently said it will offer AMD’s powerful MI300X AI chips to its customers using the Azure cloud services platform.\n\nWall Street thinks AMD can see $2 billion in run-rate revenue this year for the MI300 accelerators. CEO Lisa Su recently raised her forecast for data center graphics processing units (GPU) revenue to hit $4 billion this year, double the amount she predicted last year. Su also said the MI300 accelerator will drive 80% of that growth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is just gaining its stride in this area. Although Nvidia has been at it for longer and still owns the market, there is significant upside potential for AMD making it a top Nasdaq 100 stock to buy.\n\nO’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) The logo for O'Reilly Auto Parts is displayed on a red building front.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAftermarket auto parts is a lot more mundane than AI chips but O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) can still step on the gas. The hidden nature of such stocks makes them powerful drivers of stellar returns. O’Reilly Automotive has been like a twin-turbo V8 engine hiding under the hood of an old Ford (NYSE:F) Fiesta. Over the past decade, O’Reilly stock has returned 580% for investors, or more than twice the results of the S&P 500‘s 240% returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reason for the outperformance is that people need their cars to work. Whether its the do-it-yourself grease monkey or the do-it-for-me mechanic, O’Reilly sells the auto parts both need to keep a jalopy on the road. Particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic when supply chains caused new and used car shortages, but also in the high inflation period that we’re still going through, keeping an existing vehicle on the road is more important than ever.\n\nThe average age of a car on the road in the U.S. is a record 12.6 years. Because new cars cost so much, it is cheaper to fix up an old one. Although O’Reilly’s stock fell after first-quarter results were released because the growth was less than what Wall Street expected, auto industry conditions aren’t improving. O’Reilly Automotive’s business is still essential and will rev up its growth engines in the near future.\n\nExelon (EXC) The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: photosounds / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the exact same reasons Constellation Energy has been a star performer this year, fellow utility operator Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) should be seen in the same light.\n\nData center demand will accelerate growth in the coming quarters and years. Exelon, which operates in Illinois and Pennsylvania, says data centers and other businesses have approached the utility about supporting their demand needs. CEO Calvin Butler told analysts earlier this month, Exelon “continue to see significant activity around high-density load growth in general…we have high probability of load growth, not only in Illinois, but Pennsylvania.”\n\nAnalysts don’t believe Exelon has done as much work yet as other utility operators have with data centers. However, considering the industry’s exponential growth trajectory, it should allow the utility to capture its fair share of the market. Look for heightened opportunities in the back half of 2024.\n\nThat potential has Exelon stock moving 15% off the lows it hit earlier this year. Although the utility operator still faces some regulatory headwinds, EXC stock should outperform for the immediate future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia performed so well in its first quarter that even other tech CEOs are praising the company’s efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, Box CEO Aaron Levie joined the ranks of Nvidia cheerleaders by exalting the results of its cash cow data center business. The data center category of Nvidia’s business, which includes sales of its popular graphics processing units (GPUs), jumped 427% to $22.6 billion, compared to its fiscal first quarter last year.\n\nLevie declared Nvidia’s data center performance an economic milestone.\n\n“These 2 numbers have never been next to each other in the history of capitalism,” wrote Levie in a Wednesday X post about the data center category’s percentage growth and revenue figure.\n\nThe booming data center business brought in the majority of the company’s $26 billion quarterly revenue, which shattered analyst expectations of $24.65 billion, according to CNBC.\n\nNvidia said it expects sales in its second fiscal quarter to hit $28 billion and added that it would get a revenue boost later in the year thanks to the launch of its next-generation chip Blackwell, which CEO Jensen Huang said would help enable a “giant leap in AI.”\n\nHuang, the 31-year CEO of Nvidia, was himself complimented by fellow tech CEO Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, who said in a March Instagram post that Huang was \"[L]ike Taylor Swift, but for tech.”\n\nShares of Nvidia have taken off thanks to the AI boom and brought with it some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, along with AI leader OpenAI.\n\nEven as Nvidia faces increased competition from other chip companies and big tech companies seeking to make their own chips, Huang said the company is firing on all cylinders.\n\n“We’re racing every day,” Huang told investors. “Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand them up as quickly as possible.”\n\nNvidia’s stock broke the $1,000 mark for the first time after hours Wednesday and on Thursday its shares jumped as high as $1,062, before retreating to close the day up 9% at $1,037.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Heekyong Yang and Fanny Potkin\n\nSEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' latest high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips have yet to pass Nvidia's tests for use in the U.S. firm's AI processors due to heat and power consumption problems, three people briefed on the issues said.\n\nThe problems affect Samsung's HBM3 chips, which are the fourth-generation HBM standard currently most used in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence, as well as fifth-generation HBM3E chips that the South Korean tech giant and its rivals are bringing to market this year, they said.\n\nThe reasons for Samsung failing Nvidia's tests are being reported for the first time.\n\nSamsung said in a statement to Reuters that HBM is a customized memory product requiring \"optimization processes in tandem with customers' needs,\" adding that it is in the process of optimizing its products through close collaboration with customers. It declined to comment on specific customers.\n\nNvidia declined to comment.\n\nHBM - a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption - helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex AI applications. As demand for sophisticated GPUs has soared amid the generative AI boom, so has demand for HBM.\n\nSatisfying Nvidia - which commands around 80% of the global GPU market for AI applications - is seen as key to future growth for HBM manufacturers - both reputationally and in terms of profit momentum.\n\nSamsung has been trying to pass Nvidia's tests for HBM3 and HBM3E since last year, the three sources said. According to two of the people, the results of a recent failed test for Samsung's 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E chips came in April.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the problems can be easily addressed, but the three sources said that the failures to meet Nvidia's requirements have increased concerns in the industry and among investors that Samsung could fall further behind rivals SK Hynix and Micron Technology in HBM.\n\nThe sources, two of whom were briefed on the matter by Samsung officials, spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was confidential.\n\nNEW CHIP UNIT HEAD\n\nIn contrast to Samsung, domestic rival SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said.\n\nMicron, the only other major manufacturer of HBM, has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a move that analysts said appeared to underscore Samsung's concerns about its laggard position in HBM, Samsung this week replaced the head of its semiconductor unit saying a new person at the top was needed to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the industry.\n\nMarket expectations have been high that Samsung, as the world's biggest maker of memory chips, would quickly pass Nvidia's tests, but it's also natural that specialised products like HBM will take some time to meet customers' performance evaluations, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities.\n\nAlthough Samsung has yet to become a supplier of HBM3 to Nvidia, it does supply customers such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and is aiming to begin mass production of HBM3E chips in the second quarter. Samsung said in its statement to Reuters that its product schedule is proceeding as planned.\n\nAnalysts also say that SK Hynix, which developed the first HBM chip in 2013, has spent far more time and resources on HBM research and development than Samsung over the past decade, accounting for its technological edge.\n\nSamsung said in its statement that it developed the first commercial HBM solution for high-performance computing in 2015 and has continued to invest in HBM since then.\n\nGPU manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD are keen for Samsung to perfect its HBM chips so they can have more vendor options and weaken SK Hynix's pricing power, the sources also said.\n\nAt an Nvidia AI conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signed a placard at Samsung's booth that said \"Jensen approved\" for Samsung's 12-layer HBM3E - underscoring the company's enthusiasm about the prospect of Samsung supplying those chips.\n\nHBM3E chips are likely to become the mainstream HBM product in the market this year with shipments concentrated in the second half of 2024, according to research firm Trendforce.\n\nSeparately, SK Hynix estimates that demand for HBM memory chips in general could increase at an annual rate of 82% through 2027.\n\nAnalysts have said that Samsung's relatively weak position in HBM has been noticed by investors. Its shares are flat for the year to date, while SK Hynix's stock is up 41% and Micron's shares are up 48%.\n\n($1 = 1,362.8600 won)\n\n(Reporting by Heekyong Yang in Seoul and Fanny Potkin in Singapore; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in Seoul and Max A.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks sank on Friday, tracking weakness in Wall Street as increasing anxiety over sticky U.S. inflation and high interest rates battered sentiment towards risk-driven assets.\n\nChinese markets extended losses after clocking steep declines on Thursday, as a brewing trade war with the U.S. and military drills near Taiwan kept investors on edge.\n\nU.S. stock index futures steadied in Asian trade, after Wall Street indexes fell sharply on Thursday following a string of warnings on inflation and interest rates from Federal Reserve officials.\n\nA rally in market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)- on stellar first-quarter earnings- helped limit bigger losses in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite. But this rally did not spill over into Asia, with regional chipmakers facing their own headwinds.\n\nChinese markets fall further, Hong Kong walloped by tech rout\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, extending sharp declines from the prior session.\n\nChina was hit with a wave of negative sentiment this week as a trade war with the U.S. appeared to have escalated. The People’s Liberation Army was also seen conducting military drills near Taiwan, pointing to worsening tensions in the region.\n\nBut Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index saw outsized losses, hit by an extended rout in heavyweight technology stocks. The index slid 1.5% on Friday, adding to a 1.7% drop on Thursday.\n\nAlibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) (HK:9988) fell another 1% following a 5.2% tumble in the prior session, after it said it was issuing $5 billion in convertible bonds to spur growth.\n\nLosses in the tech giant dragged its peers Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) lower, while investors collected profits in property stocks in anticipation of more insight into Beijing’s stimulus measures.\n\nAsian stocks fall as markets price out US rate cuts\n\nBroader Asian markets fell on Friday, extending losses from the prior session as a slew of hawkish signals from the Fed- particularly warnings on sticky inflation and unchanging interest rates- saw investors largely price out expectations for interest rate cuts this year.\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 shed 1.1%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX lost 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively.\n\nSentiment towards Japan was also hit by data showing consumer inflation softened as expected in April, reflecting persistent weakness in spending.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, with the index set for profit-taking after clocking record highs on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung sinks on HBM woes, dragging KOSPI lower\n\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) over 2% on Friday after Reuters reported that the memory chip making giant’s high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips were still not meeting Nvidia’s standards, due to heating and power issues.\n\nThe report highlighted potential issues with the firm’s ambitions to gain a foothold in advanced HBM chips- demand for which is set to grow exponentially on the back of artificial intelligence.\n\nLosses in Samsung dragged South Korea’s KOSPI index over 1% lower. Samsung’s peer SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which supplies HBM chips to Nvidia, fell slightly.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks hit by rate jitters, China extends losses\n\nNCAA agrees to 'road map' settlement for college athlete payments\n\nSamsung sinks as report shows more work needed on HBM chips for Nvidia\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Shares of memory chips maker Samsung Electronics sank on Friday after Reuters reported that the company’s newest high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips were yet to pass Nvidia’s tests for use in artificial intelligence processors.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) fell 2.3% to 76,500 won, a one-month low. Losses in the stock spurred a nearly 1% decline in South Korea’s benchmark KOSPI index.\n\nReuters reported that Samsung’s HBM and HBM3E chips- which are the firm’s most advanced chips and are intended for use in AI processing units- were still not meeting NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) standards due to problems with heating and power consumption.\n\nThe report shows a potential delay in Samsung’s ambitions to capitalize on demand from the fast-growing AI industry, and could see the company falling behind rival SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which is currently the only supplier of advanced HBM3E chips in the market.\n\nMeeting Nvidia's requirements has become paramount for contract chipmakers such as Samsung, given that the U.S. firm commands over 80% of the market for advanced AI processors. Nvidia also currently makes the most advanced AI processors available in the market.\n\nU.S. rival Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) also recently said it will begin production of advanced HBM chips, demand for which is set to grow sharply amid increased AI development.\n\nSamsung is the world’s biggest memory chip maker by volume. While the firm did benefit from increased AI-driven demand in recent quarters, this trend could change if it loses out market share in the advanced HBM sector to rivals such as Micron and SK Hynix.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSamsung sinks as report shows more work needed on HBM chips for Nvidia\n\nUS SEC approves exchange applications to list spot ether ETFs\n\nMicron hit with $445 million US verdict in Netlist patent trial\n\nView comments",

        "content": "VIX Spikes, Dow Sinks As Inflation Jitters Slaughter Fed Easing Hopes: Traders Now Price In Only One Rate Cut In 2024\n\nMarkets experienced a sharp downturn Thursday afternoon following an initial surge to historic highs in technology-heavy stock indices, driven by Nvidia Corp.‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) spectacular AI-driven earnings report.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the market fear index, surged over 7% after hitting its lowest level since November 2019 earlier in the session.\n\nBlue-chip stocks were particularly affected in a broad sector selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, tracked by the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), was down 1.5% at 3:00 p.m. in New York, on track for its worst performance since March 2023.\n\nBoth the S&P 500, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), and the Nasdaq 100, monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), fell 0.9%.\n\nChipmakers were the only industry in the green, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) up 0.8%, thanks to Nvidia’s 8.7% rally.\n\nChart: Dow Eyes Worst Day In Over A Year\n\nWhat Happened: Sentiment took a hit after S&P Global released its May private sector activity surveys. The Composite PMI Index, a gauge of overall business health, showed the highest expansion rate in two years.\n\nThis might seem like good news, but the devil is in the details.\n\n“Input prices continued to rise sharply in May, with the rate of inflation accelerating to register the second-largest monthly increase seen over the past eight months,” S&P Global reported.\n\nIn particular, manufacturers experienced a steep increase, facing the largest cost rise in a year and a half. This was attributed to higher supplier prices for a wide variety of inputs, including metals, chemicals, plastics, and timber-based products, as well as higher energy and labor costs.\n\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, indicated that selling price inflation has increased, continuing to signal modestly above-target inflation.\n\nHe highlighted that the primary inflationary pressure now originates from manufacturing rather than services. This shift has resulted in elevated rates of inflation for both costs and selling prices compared to pre-pandemic standards, implying that reaching the “Fed’s 2% target still seems elusive”\n\nWhy It Matters: Stronger-than-expected business sentiment growth and renewed inflationary concerns pushed Treasury yields up across the board, leading investors to reassess the likelihood of Fed interest rate cuts.\n\nNotably, there has been a significant shift in rate cut expectations. Fed futures are currently pricing in only 34 basis points of rate cuts by year-end, translating to just one rate cut.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile investors had anticipated a rate cut by September as of Wednesday, this expectation has now been postponed to November, according to the CME Group Fed Watch Tool.\n\nThe rate-sensitive two-year Treasury yield leaped by 6 basis points to 4.93%, eyeing the highest close since May 1.\n\nThe dollar was the only gainer among major asset classes, with the Invesco DB USD Bullish Index Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), up 0.2%.\n\nNow Read:Boeing Stock Falls As CFO Forecasts Negative Cash Flow, Delivery Delays Amid Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article VIX Spikes, Dow Sinks As Inflation Jitters Slaughter Fed Easing Hopes: Traders Now Price In Only One Rate Cut In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Markets Take Profits Ahead of Long Weekend",
        "content": "Thursday, May 23rd, 2024\r\n\r\nMarket participants took the opportunity to cash in a few chips today. We’re just one trading day out from Memorial Day weekend, which brings us to unofficial summer and the lower trading volume that often takes place over this period of time. The Dow, S&P 500 and the small-cap Russell 2000 are all now down over the past week. Only the Nasdaq remains aloft. The Dow sold off -605 points today, -1.53%, while the S&P dropped -0.74%, the Nasdaq -0.39% and the Russell a somewhat painful -1.79%.\r\n\r\nClearly, the market is not desperate to attain new highs just yet. Long weekends have a way of breaking global news that may impair markets in some respect, so the safest course of action is to realize some gains after another fine showing from NVIDIA NVDA in Q1 earnings yesterday. The world’s top graphics chips maker provided more evidence that the AI-based marketplace is primed for making lots more money, even at these lofty valuations. It’s a cozy market, but we don’t need to oversleep on it.\r\n\r\nS&P flash PMI numbers were released earlier this morning. After the open, PMI Services for May came in better than expected: 54.8 versus 51.6 expected, and the fastest private services growth in at least a year. We’d seen a gradual decline over the previous three months — still north of the 50-mark, but drifting toward autumn of 2023 levels. We’ll see if this can be sustained beyond apparent seasonality; after all, 2023 posted strong May, June, July PMI Services (think summer vacations) as well.\r\n\r\nPMI Manufacturing also performed better than expected. Its May headline of 50.9 was nearly a full percentage point ahead of the 50 consensus. This 50 is also the revised Manufacturing PMI number for April, down from the originally posted 51.1. In any case, heading north from the 50 breakeven point is good for the Manufacturing sector as well. We know this space has faced plenty of uphill battles in its recent past. Basically, healthy goods-producing equals a better domestic economy.\r\n\r\nNew Home Sales, on the other hand, fell. Today’s April report tallied 634K new homes sold, below the 675K estimates and the prior print’s non-adjusted 665K. These are seasonally adjusted, annualized units but nevertheless show last month to be the weakest since February’s 631K and November of last year’s 611K. But rumblings about currently being in a housing recession are likely to continue after this report. We haven’t seen a month with as many as 700K new homes sold since July of last year, after a huge spike around Halloween of the 2020 Covid year.\r\n\r\nTomorrow we’ll get new Durable Goods Orders for April. These are expected to fall month over month, from a robust +0.9% in March to -0.5% in Friday’s morning’s print. We’ll also see final Consumer Sentiment for May, which is expected to tick up slightly month over month to 67.6. We expect more evidence that nothing is burning up into the stratosphere (expect NVIDIA and AI, but they can justify it) and nothing is crumbling into rubble. Still one more trading day before the long weekend.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Brian's Big Idea on Nvidia (NVDA), Should You Buy Now?",
        "content": "Brian Bolan is the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research and he has a big idea for people that are wondering if they should buy Nvidia NVDA after the most recent earnings report.\n\nBrian takes a look at the stock following an earnings beat which is the 6th consecutive beat for the stock. Brian mentions that there are dozens of analysts that cover this name at brokerages so the consensus is a fairly deep number. Despite all of that coverage the company continues to outperform expectations.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share of $6.12 when the Zacks consensus estimate stood at $5.49. That beat of $0.63 works out to be a positive earnings surprise of 11.5%. Over the last four quarters the average positive earnings surprise has worked out to be 18.4%.\n\nSales came in at $26B when the expectation was calling for $24.3B. The company then guided next quarter revenue to a range of between $27.4B to $28.6B when the consensus was sitting at $26.2B. When a company guides revenue higher than expectations the stock often moves higher.\n\nValuation\n\nNVDA trades at a 38x forward earnings multiple, which is a lot but not at the nifty 50 level that a lot of investors are used to seeing for companies that post year over year growth of more than 100% and are expected to show continued growth of 100% in the next quarter. The price to book multiple comes in at 55x and while that may scare off some value investors the idea here is that there is still a lot of growth before this can become a value stock. The price to sales multiple of 29x also feels like a lofty number but again the growth is really there.\n\nStock Split\n\nOn the earnings call the company announced a 10 for 1 stock split. This means that the price of NVIDIA stock will seem to drop dramatically on June 10th, but at the same time you will now have 10 shares for everyone that you own. Brian discusses how retail investors have a hard time stomaching very large point moves even when the stock is trading at $900 or $1000 or $1100.\n\nAlong with the stock split the company announced a 150% increase to its dividend.\n\nZacks Portfolio Managers Love NVDA\n\nThere are at least three portfolios run by David Bartosiak, Kevin Cook and Andrew Rocco that all have NVDA in them.\n\nNot surprisingly, NVDA is the top performer for all three of those portfolios.\n\nBlockchain Innovators is run by “Buy and Hold” David Bartosiak and he added shares of NVDA back in April of 2019 at $43 and change. He is sitting on a gain of more than 2300% in that position.\n\nKevin Cook might be our biggest NVDA bull as he bought shares back in October of 2022 at $125 and is showing a gain of 744% on those shares. Kevin runs the TAZR service which stands for Technical Analysis and Zacks Rank. He also added shares of NVDL, which is a 2x leveraged ETF on NVDA about a month ago and has a 73% return on that position as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally we have our Tech Innovators service that is managed by Andrew Rocco and he is a little more active of a trader. He added shares to the service on April 29 of 2024 at $875 and is already up 20.5% in just a month on that position.\n\nShould You Buy NVDA\n\nThe big question that investors have is should they be buying NVDA right now. The answer, according to Brian Bolan is yes. The company Noted in the release that they are preparing for their next wave of growth. The AI build out continues and now the company is looking at accelerated computing as another growth driver. When a company posts higher than expected revenues and increased margins there is growth in earnings per share. When earnings per share grows and there still looks to be continued momentum on the top line share prices often move higher.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Super Micro Computer Stock Fell Today Despite Nvidia's Blockbuster Quarter -- Is This a Buying Opportunity?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock fell in Thursday's trading. The server specialist's share price closed out the daily session down 3%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock had been up as much as 11.3% early in the day's trading.\n\nWhile there wasn't any business-specific news powering Supermicro's initial gains today, investors poured into the stock following Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) strong first-quarter results. But bullish momentum receded, and the gains didn't hold.\n\nVolatility hits Supermicro stock after Nvidia's Q1 report\n\nSupermicro purchases graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and uses them as key components in the servers that it sells. These servers have been in high demand as companies have moved to rapidly deploy and scale artificial intelligence (AI) software.\n\nNvidia reported first-quarter results after the market closed yesterday and once again posted results that crushed the market's expectations. The AI leader reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $6.12 on sales of $26.04 billion. Meanwhile, an average of analysts surveyed by the London Stock Exchange Group had suggested that the business would post adjusted earnings of $5.59 per share on sales of $24.65 billion.\n\nNvidia has become the clearest and most intensely monitored bellwether for the state of the AI industry. The company's high-performance GPUs are the foundational hardware that has helped pave the way for the creation and scaling of today's most advanced and most popular artificial intelligence software. Some investors may have been expecting Nvidia's results to drive a bigger pop for Supermicro stock, and it looks like a sizable number of shareholders opted to take profits as momentum started to waver.\n\nAfter a massive run, is Supermicro stock still a buy?\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock has skyrocketed roughly 414% over the last year even after today's slight pullback. With the stock currently trading at roughly 36 times this year's expected earnings, some solid growth is already priced into the server specialist's share price. SMCI Chart\n\nOn the other hand, the business has also been serving up stellar sales and earnings growth. There are also good reasons to think that the artificial intelligence revolution is still in very early innings.\n\nFor risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term plays in the AI space that still have the potential to deliver strong returns, I think that Supermicro stock is still a worthwhile buy. The potential for competitive and macroeconomic pressures to create valuation volatility is certainly here, but the company has strong tailwinds at its back.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Dow Jones Futures were flat at 39,152.0 points.\n\nNvidia rally pauses after bumper earnings\n\nNvidia fell 0.3% in aftermarket trade after surging to a record high of $1,063.0 during Thursday’s session.\n\nThe market darling clocked stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings, while it also presented a robust second-quarter outlook and announced a 10-for-one stock split.\n\nWhile gains in Nvidia had initially spilled over into broader technology stocks- on hopes that demand for artificial intelligence will help buoy the sector- this notion was largely offset by fears of high for longer U.S. interest rates, especially following hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve.\n\nStill, gains in Nvidia- which is the third-largest company on Wall Street- helped reduce overall losses in benchmark stock indexes.\n\nWall Street battered by inflation, rate jitters\n\nBut broad-based losses saw Wall Street indexes end largely lower on Thursday, after signals from the Fed showed that policymakers were growing increasingly concerned over sticky inflation, which in turn was likely to delay any potential rate cuts this year.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.7% to 5,267.84 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.4% to 16,736.03 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average- which has much lower tech weightage than its peers- was by far the worst performer, sinking 1.5% to 39,065.26 points.\n\nThe minutes of the Fed’s late-April meeting, coupled with hawkish comments from several individual Fed officials, showed the central bank saw even slower progress towards inflation reaching its 2% annual target.\n\nThis saw traders largely price out expectations of rate cuts this year. The CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in a nearly equal probability- around 46%- that the Fed will either hold or cut rates in September.\n\nThursday’s losses put the S&P and the Dow on course for weekly losses, while the Nasdaq sharply trimmed its gains for the week. All three indexes had hit record highs earlier this week, which also left them open to a heavy bout of profit-taking.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after losses as inflation fears offset Nvidia boost\n\nMicron hit with $445 million US verdict in Netlist patent trial\n\nBurger King to launch $5 value meal\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia's First Quarter Results Confirm That The Next Industrial Revolution Is Well Underway\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported its fiscal first quarter results, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates as demand for AI chips remains as robust as ever. Nvidia sales continue to skyrocket as Google, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft-backed OpenAI spend billions of dollars to buy its graphics processing units to develop and deploy generative AI applications. During extended trading on Wednesday, Nvidia shares rose 7% and surpassed $1,000 for the first time.\n\nImpressive Fiscal First Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 28th, Nvidia reported that revenue grew262% YoY as it amounted to $26.04 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $24.65 billion. Data center alone reported a revenue rise of 427% YoY to $22.6 billion, with large cloud providers like Google, Microsoft and Amazon contributing about mid-40%. Meta Platforms and its announcement of Lama 3, their latest large language model which used 24,000 H100 GPUs, was the highlight of Nvidia’s reported quarter.\n\nNetworking revenue grew more than three times compared to last year’s comparable quarter to $3.2 billion, owed primarily to InfiniBand products. Gaming revenue grew 18% to $2.65 billion.Although a much smaller business, Nvidia also makes chips for cars and advanced graphics workstations. Professional visualization brought in $427 million with $329 million in automotive sales.\n\nNet income amounted to $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share, skyrocketing from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $2 billion.\n\nAn Even More Impressive Outlook\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for sales of $28 billion. Later this year, Nvidia expects even more revenue growth from its next-generation AI chip, with Blackwell expected to unlock a new growth phase for the AI chip leader. Financial Times reported earlier this week Amazon is eagerly waiting for Nvidia's newest superchip.\n\nNvidia expected a blockbuster quarter and it was just as impressive as anticipated. Although Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all stated that they intend to be less reliant on Nvidia’s chips as they plan to spend $200 billion this year on chips and data centers they need to train and operate their AI systems, they are not there year. Nvidia’s results have become the most important event on the macroeconomic calendar. It’s no exaggeration to say that its quarterly reports have become an indicator of strength of the AI boom that is not showing any signs of slowing down as AI seems to be the new commodity, marking a new era and the next industrial revolution. The new AI era began with Nvidia and by the looks of it, it is just getting started as CEO Jensen Huang assured that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell is way ahead of supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Bargain Bin: 3 Cheap Stocks to Buy Before Memorial Day",
        "content": "Wall Street investors are looking for cheap stocks to buy before the summer holiday period. Despite the rally we have witnessed so far in the year, risks like increased market volatility and uncertainty over economic factors still persist. Geopolitical tensions and the upcoming presidential election in November also add to the difficulty of finding hidden gems.\n\nTo navigate these challenges, our focus today is on companies with strong fundamentals and future growth potential, including those stocks whose prices might have come under pressure in 2024. We will also pay attention to trailing or forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. The trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the current share price by the earnings per share over the past 12 months, while the forward P/E estimates likely earnings per share for the next 12 months. Though low ratios imply value, excessively low ones may also signal risks, reflecting market concerns about the company’s prospects.\n\nLet’s now explore three cheap stocks to buy before the holiday season. Remember, diversification is essential. Consider a mix of stocks across different sectors to spread risks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company on our list of cheap stocks to buy is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). I believe it offers a blend of value, growth potential and stability in cybersecurity and networking solutions. After a challenging 2023 and weak 2024 performance, the stock potentially offers better value for long-term investors.\n\nIn mid-May, Cisco reported mixed fiscal third-quarter earnings. Investors raised eyebrows as revenues declined 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $12.7 billion, primarily due to customer implementations of existing products. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was 88 cents, down 12%, with a 1 cent impact from the Splunk deal.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier in February, Wall Street paid attention to Cisco’s announcement. Management will collaborate with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure solutions. Investors are hopeful that Cisco may expand its product portfolio, driving growth.\n\nLooking ahead, Cisco’s management increased its revenue guidance for fiscal year 2024. The $28 billion acquisition of Splunk underscores Cisco’s strategic shift towards cybersecurity, complemented by the Isovalent acquisition. Notably, Splunk already contributed $413 million in revenues.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), CSCO stock has declined over 6.5%. As a result, it’s currently trading at 15.7 times trailing earnings, 13.8 times forward earnings and 3.4 times sales. CSCO’s metrics are quite different from the higher multiples we see in many tech stocks. Additionally, Cisco stock now offers a dividend yield of over 3.4%. Analysts predict a 12-month price target of $53.25, with a potential increase of 13%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you are looking for another contender among cheap stocks to buy, Merck (NYSE:MRK) deserves your attention due to its strong fundamentals and attractive valuation. The healthcare company’s diversified pipeline in vaccines, HIV and oncology supports its growth potential.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Merck announced a 9% YOY increase in revenue of $15.8 billion, driven by strong growth in oncology and vaccines. Keytruda and Gardasil were major contributors, with its sales growing by 24% and 14%, respectively. Non-GAAP EPS rose 48% to $2.07.\n\nMerck continues to advance its pipeline and portfolio, including the FDA approval for Winrevair. Recently, it announced promising results about treatment for advanced gastric cancer, potentially boosting the growth of the drug as well. In addition, the company has expanded its offerings through acquisitions, including Harpoon Therapeutics and the proposed acquisition of Elanco‘s (NYSE:ELAN) Aqua Business. As a result, management raised both the outlook for revenues and EPS for fiscal year 2024.\n\nSince January, MRK shares have surged by over 20%, while currently offering a 2.3% dividend yield. Also, they change hands a relatively attractive valuation at 15.2 times forward earnings and 5.4 times sales. Wall Street shares this optimism, projecting a 12-month price target of $145, an upside potential of 10%.\n\nMGM Resorts International (MGM) A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.\n\nSource: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the summer travel season approaches, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) braces for unprecedented passenger volumes nationwide. This surge in travel not only signifies a resurgence in leisure and business activities but also promises a boon for the hospitality industry including casinos. With the increasing trend of electronic betting, both traditional and online gaming firms will likely benefit from the enthusiasm for travel and entertainment.\n\nTherefore, our final pick among the cheap stocks to buy is MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM). With iconic properties like Bellagio and Mandalay Bay across global locations, MGM offers diverse amenities from gaming to BetMGM’s online betting, making it a notable long-term investment.\n\nMGM’s first-quarter financials revealed robust revenues and profits. Consolidated revenues of $4.4 billion notched a record for the period, driven by strong domestic and international travel and hotel booking trends. Adjusted EPS came in at 74 cents, a significant improvement from 44 cents the previous year.\n\nManagement’s forward guidance suggests continued momentum in 2024, with plans for expansion into online sports betting and international markets such as Eastern Europe and Japan. The company also plans to continue investing in its business, including share repurchases and equity investments, to drive long-term growth and increase shareholder value.\n\nDespite an 8% decline in its stock price so far this year, MGM’s potential for revenue and margin growth is backed by its relatively favorable metrics, including a trailing P/E ratio of 15.7x and a P/S ratio of 0.86x. Finally, analysts’ 12-month average price target of $56.5 indicates a potential increase of 38%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil held both long and short positions in NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Why Intel Stock Was Sliding Today",
        "content": "Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) were heading lower today, even though there was no news out on the stock.\n\nInstead, the chip stock seemed to react poorly to a strong earnings report from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, an area Intel is keen on tapping into. Additionally, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, a move some think will lead to the company's admission into the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel, the only semiconductor business currently in the Dow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat Nvidia's report means for Intel\n\nThere wasn't any direct impact on Intel from Nvidia's update, but the report gives no hint that Intel is gaining any traction in the AI GPU market with its new Gaudi3 accelerator.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang also pushed back on the notion that competition was becoming a threat to the company, arguing that performance in its business equates with the lowest total cost of ownership. He also touted other advantages of Nvidia, including that it's in every cloud, making it attractive for developers to build on as opposed to a system that a hyperscaler creates for itself. Finally, he made the case that Nvidia is more than just a chipmaker -- it's building AI factories, which is much more complicated.\n\nAdditionally, with Nvidia's stock split taking effect June 10, the prospects for Nvidia replacing Intel in the Dow seem very real. Intel has been a longtime laggard at this point, with a market of $128 billion, which represents just 5% of the market cap of Nvidia. Nvidia is also the most valuable U.S. stock to not be included in the Dow.\n\nWhat it means for Intel\n\nIt's unclear how meaningful Nvidia's results are for Intel. After all, Nvidia also noted that the data center market is huge, and it's still seeing demand outstrip supply, so Intel should be able to pick up some market share with its AI GPUs.\n\nHowever, the notion that Intel will pose a serious challenge to Nvidia in the GPU market seems foolish at this point, and Intel still has a lot to prove.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Soared on Thursday Morning",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) soared as much as 11.3% higher on Thursday morning, following a fantastic earnings report by chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Supermicro investors saw Nvidia's success story as a good sign, since high demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips translates into strong sales of custom AI-crunching computers.\n\nThe enthusiasm faded somewhat later in the day, and Supermicro's stock was up by 2.1% at 1 p.m. ET. Any uptick after a 52-week gain of 438% looks like good news, though.\n\nNvidia's market-moving results\n\nThe leader in AI chip design saw sales rise 262% year over year to $26 billion. Its data center segment's revenue surged even faster, clocking a 427% gain over the same period.\n\nThat unbroken market momentum is good news for Supermicro, since a pile of Nvidia chips or Blackwell AI accelerator cards won't train any AI systems. You need a properly integrated computer system to train them, and Supermicro's products fit the bill for many AI giants.\n\nWhy didn't Supermicro stay aloft today?\n\nSupermicro reported its own results for the comparable period two weeks ago, tripling its top-line sales and skyrocketing even faster on the bottom line. Clever investors can see Supermicro's reports as a bellwether of what Nvidia might be up to.\n\nThat being said, I'm not surprised to see Supermicro's Nvidia-based gains fade out. Again, the company's own results already pointed in this direction, and Wall Street has had plenty of time to price Supermicro's stock accordingly.\n\nOn that note, Nvidia's growth might be exciting, but Supermicro is matching it step for step -- and at a much milder stock valuation. Nvidia shares are changing hands at 33 times sales and 62 times earnings today, while Supermicro's valuation ratios stop at 4.4 and 50, respectively. So if you're looking for a high-octane AI stock at a more modest price level than Nvidia, Supermicro could fit the bill.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $581,764!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. TheStock Advisorservice has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 13, 2024\n\nWhy Super Micro Computer Stock Soared on Thursday Morning was originally published by The Motley Fool\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Another tech sector leader is gearing up to split its stock. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the company responsible for powering much of this year’s artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, is about to enact a 10-for-1 stock split. After reporting record earnings and blowing past Wall Street estimates on several key metrics, the Silicon Valley darling will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10, 2024.\n\nIf you hold a position in NVDA stock, this development won’t negatively impact your holdings. But it will likely generate a trading frenzy as retail investors rush in to stock up on the newly discounted shares.\n\nWhat’s Happening With NVDA Stock?\n\nSo far, it has been a good day for NVDA stock. As of this writing, shares are up more than 10%, likely due to Nvidia’s earnings success. But investors also shouldn’t overlook the potential catalyst that is the Nvidia stock split. A rush of activity from new investors could provide a convenient boost, helping the momentum continue. As I recently reported for InvestorPlace, high-growth names often split their stocks when their share prices reach hard-to-attain levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis new development may also help Nvidia achieve a fresh milestone: Becoming a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. “Once Nvidia shares fall to the low $100-ish range after the split takes effect on June 7, the stock could make sense as a new Dow component,” speculates Paul La Monica of Barron’s. “It would seem to be a fairly easy decision to make.”\n\nIf Nvidia makes it into that exclusive market club, rival chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) could lose its spot in the Dow as well. That would follow six months of steady decline for INTC stock.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nAll told, just about everything looks good for Nvidia right now. The combination of the successful earnings beat and the momentum for its upcoming stock split should help NVDA stay in the green for the foreseeable future. Additionally, CEO Jensen Huang recently highlighted just how strong demand is for Nvidia’s chips. This suggests that Nvidia is destined to keep climbing, even as rival chipmakers attempt to take market share for themselves.\n\nToday should remind investors just how well off Nvidia is right now. The company’s earnings smash has helped power a market rally. Now, new investors will be able to double down on NVDA stock as soon as the split takes effect.\n\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O’Brient did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamuel O’Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

        "content": "Riding the coattails of the so-called super investors isn’t a bad strategy so long as you don’t blindly follow their lead. Performing your own due diligence is essential before putting your money at risk. Just because the smart money is buying doesn’t mean it isn’t a dumb investment. Still, plenty of their purchases are solid guru stock picks.\n\nBelow are the three biggest holdings in the portfolio of one of the world’s largest asset management firms, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW). It has almost $816 billion in assets under management (AUM). While it charges fees to its customers for its investment advice, you don’t need to pay for special insider access. Simply look at their latest 13F filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission to see where their money is flowing. It’s not real-time decision-making but it is a way to narrow down the vast universe of stocks into a more manageable set of ideas.\n\nJust make sure you don’t need the money you want to invest to pay for bills or emergencies. With a minimum three to five-year investment horizon, and preferably a decade or more, you might find these stocks Wall Street’s elite are buying are ones you want to piggyback onto as well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough T. Rowe Price money managers have been selling down their stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the past several quarters, they still own an enormous tranche of stock. Apple represents 4.4% of the firm’s total value or some $35.5 billion worth of stock. That equates to 207 million shares.\n\nThat’s about one-quarter of the amount Warren Buffett owns through Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B). And even the Oracle of Omaha has been selling down his shares in the tech giant. Last quarter, he sold about $20 billion worth of shares. It’s not the first time he’s sold his favorite stock, but he usually does it for tax reasons.\n\nStill, T. Rowe Price has an average buy price of $74.71 per share, giving it a nice 156% return on its investment. It might be just taking some profits off the table. Like Buffett, it will probably be holding on for the long haul.\n\nAnd why not? Apple remains a highly profitable company and just announced a huge $110 billion stock buyback program. With its newest iPhone model due out later this year, reportedly possessing new artificial intelligence (AI) features, it could become a hugely popular device.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of AI, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become synonymous with the technology. Whereas it was once the premier videogame chipmaker (it still is), that was long ago overshadowed by its absolute dominance of artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia owns the market for data center graphics processing units (GPU). Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate the chipmaker owns 98% of the market but expects that drop to between 94% and 96%. While rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and even Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) are bringing their chips to market and will eat away at Nvidia’s hold on the space, it will still reign supreme.\n\nT. Rowe Price has also been paring back its position in Nvidia, dropping its holdings from 56.5 million shares a year ago to 46.2 million today. That’s still a whopping $41.7 billion position in the semiconductor stock, good enough for 5.1% of the investment firm’s portfolio.\n\nThere is nothing on the horizon for Nvidia to suggest T. Rowe Price will significantly slash its position. Indeed, with some of the most powerful new chips to ever be created, Nvidia has a large runway of growth still to come though you might want to hold off to see where its first-quarter earnings land the chipmaker.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest holding in T. Rowe Price’s portfolio belongs to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The money manager owns 142.2 million shares at an average buy price of $83.57 per share. That means Microsoft stock weighs in at $59.8 billion, good enough for the top spot and representing 7.3% of total AUM.\n\nMicrosoft has become a premier AI stock in its own right, even if not in the same way that Nvidia is. The tech star became an early adopter of the technology and quickly grasped its importance to the company’s future trajectory. Microsoft integrated AI into all of its products, services and platforms and it continues to explore new ways to exploit it.\n\nMicrosoft is offering for sale to its Azure cloud customers AI chips from AMD as an alternative to Nvidia. It will make available AMD’s MI300X chips, while also selling its own Maia AI chip.  Microsoft will soon introduce a new processor, too, called Cobalt 100, which reportedly offers 40% better performance than competitor designs. And it just announced it was introducing new computers featuring chips that can run A.I. applications natively.\n\nThese are just some of the many good reasons why Microsoft holds such a near and dear position in T. Rowe Price’s portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) exuberance seems to be slowing down somewhat, as many of the GPT-wrapped “startups” face mounting operational costs and limited marketability. Likewise, investors increasingly see through the facade when run-of-the-mill firms slap “AI” labeling across a range of unrelated products and services.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean the AI sector is dead — far from it. The best AI stocks beyond well-known names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are slowly building behind the scenes, if not unknown to the wider investor sector. But these companies’ long-term potential is becoming increasingly clear. For investors willing to wait, patience could offer massive rewards as the tech matures and their respective operations dreams come into focus.\n\nEvolv Technologies (EVLV) Businessperson Shaking Hand With Digital Partner Over Futuristic Background, MnM stocks replacing the Magnificent 7.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs public and private physical security takes an increasingly central role in event and infrastructure planning, AI stocks like Evolv Technologies (NASDAQ:EVLV) may soon become the next big thing in threat detection. Evolv’s screening tech detects concealed weapons while also leveraging threat-detection tools to identify and prevent harmful acts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe best part — for the general public — is that, since Evolv’s tech is AI-driven, it processes security screening queues much faster than traditional human visual screening processes.\n\nOf course, investors have plenty to like about this AI stock. Though fairly new, the company added more than 300 new clients to its portfolio last year which contributed to a 120% growth in annual recurring revenue. As expected from such a new, growing company, EVLV isn’t yet profitable.\n\nMoreover, despite trading in small-cap territory, shares slid earlier this month following an earnings miss. Still, Evolv’s trajectory is nearly unmatched compared to AI stocks of a similar size, and its proven market potential could spur long-term growth despite discount pricing.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) certainly isn’t a little-known stock, but its potential among AI stocks goes generally overlooked. The Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company is, of course, best known for its role in crypto-centric operations. But mining is increasingly pricy for fewer rewards, and artificial intelligence companies need vast quantities of power to run even the most basic tasks — making Riot Platforms a perfect potential partner moving forward.\n\nRiot already sells unused energy back to local municipalities and utility operators; last year, the company generated $71.2 million in revenue from this sales stream. While Riot isn’t yet in the artificial intelligence energy offering business, it’s likely just a matter of time until the economic arrangement just makes sense for both parties.\n\nStory continues\n\nLikewise, data centers aren’t being built quickly enough to match AI demand — meaning existing GPU facilities, like Riot’s, may soon come at a premium. In the meantime, investors waiting for Riot’s potential as an AI stock to come to fruition can rest easy knowing they have peripheral exposure to Bitcoin, considering the crypto’s 10% jump this week alone.\n\nParsons (PSN) Conceptual background of artificial intelligence, humans and cyber-business on programming technology element, 3D illustration. Next trillion-dollar companies. top AI stocks billionaires buy\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.com\n\nParsons (NYSE:PSN), a defense tech company with a diverse range of products in intelligence and security may be one of today’s most overlooked AI companies, considering the sector is stacked with name-brand competitors like Palantir (NYSE:PLTR). But whereas Palantir and similar defense tech companies focus on the software side, Parsons brings a range of AI offerings to very tangible hardware-centric tech developments.\n\nThe company’s achievements include ballistic missile site development, rocketry hardware, nuclear site management, and infrastructure development (which could become a major political talking point as the election heats up). Parsons’ wide-ranging operations demand robust technical data management and oversight, allowing it to lead with internally managed AI solutions, and push the boundaries of its AI-enabled hardware.\n\nIn addition to defense applications, Parsons is expanding its AI-driven drone solutions to include infrastructure inspection tools. These tools transform the evaluation of existing and ongoing infrastructure projects like bridges, roadways, and water treatment facilities. This positions Parsons as a key player in deploying AI to challenging or hazardous areas that require comprehensive and in-depth safety assessments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in RIOT.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. Should You Buy Too?",
        "content": "Keeping tabs on what billionaire hedge fund managers do is a great way to check your investment strategy. While blindly following them isn't advisable, seeing what they're doing and checking that against your own thoughts is a good way of seeing if you're on the same page, especially when there's a hot trend like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe 13F filings for Q1 were recently released, revealing some common themes across hedge funds. While many stocks were bought, one is a clear favorite.\n\nAlphabet was a common purchase among all three hedge funds\n\nI'll focus on three hedge funds: Tiger Global Management, Soros Fund Management, and Bridgewater Associates. These funds are run by billionaires Chase Coleman, George Soros, and Ray Dalio, respectively. In Q1, all three of these funds had sizable purchases of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). For Bridgewater and Tiger, Alphabet was the most purchased stock in Q1.\n\nThis is a large nod of confidence to Alphabet, especially since many saw it struggle to roll out AI products initially. However, its Gemini generative AI technology has dramatically improved and is now starting to integrate AI into search results to summarize what you've searched for. Many investors have been waiting for Alphabet to announce this technology, and now that it has, it reinforces the fact that Alphabet is a top player in the tech world.\n\nBut that wasn't the only AI stock these hedge funds were buying.\n\nBridgewater also bought Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). While Tiger Global didn't buy any of these stocks in Q1, it's already heavily exposed, as Meta and Nvidia make up nearly 20% and 5% of its portfolio, respectively. As a result, it shouldn't be surprising that Tiger didn't add any more of these stocks due to its hefty concentration already. Soros Fund Management doesn't own either of these companies, but it isn't as tech-heavy as the other two.\n\nMeta is similar to Alphabet in that its primary business is advertising. So to improve its standing in this field, Meta has rolled out generative AI tools to advertisers, and is also starting to develop its own chips to process its AI workloads.\n\nNvidia hardly needs any introduction in the AI world, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are at the core of training and processing AI models. Despite its massive rise already, Nvidia continues to see incredibly strong demand, which will continue until all AI infrastructure is built.\n\nWith billionaires buying these three stocks, investors might be prompted to buy them now. However, these stocks were purchased between the start of the year and March 31, so it has been nearly two months since this activity occurred. So are they still buys now?\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta and Alphabet are still reasonably priced stocks\n\nAll three of these businesses are mature companies undergoing drastic changes. So I'll use their forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to value them, because it considers the business shifts occurring. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNvidia trades at a healthy premium to Meta and Alphabet simply because it's rapidly growing and has the potential to do that for many years. This makes Nvidia one of the harder stocks to assess on the stock market.\n\nAlphabet and Meta trade at much more reasonable valuations and only hold slight premiums to the broader S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.6.Still, each posted solid earnings growth in Q1 (Alphabet's earnings per share rose 62%, while Meta's rose 120%), so they are on the right track.\n\nOf the three, Alphabet and Meta are probably the biggest no-brainer buys. They are executing at a high level and can be purchased at a reasonable price. Nvidia requires more work, and investors must understand the expectations built into the stock, as they are quite high. But it may still be a viable option for investors to scoop up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $584,435!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The 2025 Millionaire’s Club: 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "If you’re on the hunt for quantum computing stocks to buy, you’re in the right place. For the past several years, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the front stage. Not just in the tech field, but also in the stock market. AI advancement has been tremendous, allowing businesses, both large and small, to automate some of their processes. Some of the largest companies have ramped up their investing in AI teams and divisions, amounting to billions of dollars in additional capital just to keep up with others in the field.\n\nHowever, there is a newcomer to the field that is independent of AI but will complement it in the future, which is quantum computing. But what is it exactly? Quantum computing uses specialized algorithms and hardware while using quantum mechanics to solve complex problems that typical computers will take either too long to solve or cannot solve entirely. Although the world of quantum computing and AI is incredibly complex, we have simplified investing in the field by narrowing it down to 3 companies that are at the forefront of the industry, while still being diversified.\n\nQuantum Computing Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American-based and international leader in the designing and manufacturing of graphics processing units. Although the company’s main focus currently is on the AI market, it also has a division that focuses on the quantum computing industry. The stock currently trades at about $924, with a price target of $1,100. This new price target is almost $200 more than the current trading price of a stock, signifying a significant upside potential for Nvidia.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company accelerates quantum computing centers around the world with its proprietary CUDA-Q platform. The platform also ties quantum computing into AI, allowing the system to solve new and countless problems much faster than before.\n\nThe stock currently trades at 36.53x forward earnings. This is about 20% lower in comparison to the stock’s own five-year average forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.14x. Thus, considering what the stock usually trades for, it might be relatively undervalued and at a great point to scoop up some shares.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nThe company that goes hand in hand with the internet is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The American company first started as a search engine in the late 90s with its main goal of creating the perfect search engine. Fast forward 25 years and you now have a multi-trillion-dollar international company with departments in tech, consumer electronics, data, AI, e-commerce and quantum computing. The company’s stock currently trades at about $177 but is on track to rise to an average of $195, with a high of $225 in the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent years, it has set out to build the best quantum computing for otherwise impossible problems with the introduction of XPRIZE Quantum Applications and Quantum AI. The program is designed to advance the field of algorithms relating to quantum computing with real-world applications.\n\nAs such, the company is in a quickly growing phase, and EPS is forecast to soar from $5.80 last year to over $7.84 by 2025. This makes it a great pick for any investor.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NYSE:INTC) has specialized in semiconductors since its founding in Mountain View, California in 1968. The company is the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors and CPUs and has been since its founding. Intel’s stock is at about $32 and the average price target is $39.63, with a low of $17 and a high of $68. This would mean an upside potential of almost 24%, on average.\n\nThe company has invested heavily in quantum computing in the past several years and is currently putting its expertise to good use, creating “hot silicon spin qubits”. Qubits are essentially small computing devices that perform differently than typical transistors while also operating at high temperatures.\n\nThe company is working diligently on applying the qubits into quantum computing chips that can be used to advance countless fields, while also working with AI systems. All this work is not for nothing. The company is translating this into earnings growth with EPS expected to rise from $1.01 at the end of this year to $1.80 by the end of 2025. As such, this stock should be on any investor’s watch list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors traditionally favored mega-cap tech giants such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for their artificial intelligence (AI) investments. That makes sense, just given the kind of run Nvidia has been on of late.\n\nHowever, overlooked AI stocks hold tremendous potential for even greater gains than some of these heavily-covered stocks. These companies may carry as much upside from this technology. But that value isn’t likely getting priced into their respective stock prices.\n\nFinding these overlooked AI stocks isn’t easy. And in some respects, the names on this list aren’t entirely overlooked. There’s a strong AI thesis many investors are already aware of for these stocks, but it’s not their primary story. A portion of investors focus less on AI and more on the other fantastic business units driving revenue and profitability growth for these giants.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNonetheless, these stocks have big AI potential. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL), a global software company, capitalizes on AI demand with its Gen2 cloud infrastructure, essential for processing complex AI workloads. Despite its overshadowing, Oracle’s role in AI infrastructure is gaining recognition, especially with plans for 100 new data centers. With a $20 billion cloud business, Oracle’s AI-driven growth potential is just emerging.\n\nIn other Oracle news, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Oracle deepened their 30-year partnership, investing in generative AI solutions to drive growth and innovation. Leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), these two partners are looking to empower businesses with real-time data analysis for large-scale transformations.\n\nMoreover, Choice Hotels International, a global lodging franchisor, partnered with Oracle Hospitality to deploy Oracle Nor1, an AI-powered merchandising solution. This implementation aimed to boost revenue and enhance guest experiences through personalized services and offers. Oracle Nor1 utilized AI to deliver tailored offers via mobile apps and digital channels, optimizing conversion rates.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced additional rounds of layoffs lately, the company remains a top stock to buy. The firm’s Q1 saw Amazon report a 13% increase in net sales and a tripling of net income year-over-year (YOY). AMZN’s online marketplace remains their key revenue driver. Additionally, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising segments are gaining traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Amazon is seeing impressive sales and net income profit over the years despite inflation surge. However, recent challenges from inflation have impacted e-commerce and cloud sales. Nevertheless, Amazon adapted by optimizing its cost structure and transitioning to a regional fulfillment model, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.\n\nA $9 billion investment in Singapore for cloud computing underscores its commitment to regional expansion. This move followed Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) lead in Southeast Asia. Also, Amazon is continuing to increase its focus on generative AI, including ChatGPT and Amazon Bedrock. And this is strengthening its core capabilities and enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nThese factors and a 21% year-to-date (YTD) stock increase have led analysts to rate Amazon as a strong buy.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nCapitalizing and growing on AI trends, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is not only focusing in smartphones. The company has now a strong position that strengthens the demand that grows through the years. Moreover, through more AI-powered innovations, Q2 is set to show more growth.\n\nIts recent Snapdragon X Elite, which is based on an ARM chip, aims to offer more enhance performance and efficiency for computers. This includes M3-chip MacBooks and Windows laptops. These chips will be groundbreaking and are set to be released mid-2024. In other QCOM news, Ampere Computingannounced a partnership with Qualcomm to introduce a new solution to reduce power consumption for AI chips.\n\nFounded by former Intel president Renee James, Ampere utilizes Arm Holdings technology to produce energy-efficient central processing chips used by Oracle, Google and more. The startup prioritizes energy efficiency over industry leaders like Intel and AMD.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "If you’re looking to take a new position in your portfolio in tech stocks, there’s no time like the present. In fact, perhaps you’re a little late to the game. But late is better than never when it comes to finding the top tech stocks to buy.\n\nTech stocks are driving the stock market and have done so for the last year. The growth of generative AI launched a revolution in tech stocks, as many companies are looking for new ways to incorporate AI in their platforms.\n\nFor tech stocks, there’s a lot more to consider than just AI. Tech stocks also represent companies that are involved in hardware, software, cybersecurity, renewable energy technology and communications.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are companies that must be consistently innovating and growing to stay ahead of the curve. And that could lead to significant returns for investors.\n\nTech stocks are appealing because the companies they represent are deft at adapting and pivoting in response to market demands and technological advancements. While they can sometimes be volatile, top tech stocks trend higher over the long term, so it makes sense to take a new position in some top-rated names.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader is our guide in finding the best tech stocks to buy, based on their earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum. If you don’t already have a stake in these names, this could be an ideal time to make an initial investment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe’re closing in on the sixth month of the year, but nothing’s really changed with my enthusiasm for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe maker of highly advanced graphics processing units is perhaps the most gripping tech stock of the decade, with a market cap that’s now north of $2 trillion.\n\nAnd even though NVDA stock pulled back a little bit in recent weeks, I see that as people taking their profits rather than doubting Nvidia’s potential. If anything NVDA stock will be gathering momentum for another move higher.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 came out after the closing bell on May 22 and once again blew away expectations. Revenue was $26 billion, up 18% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and up 262% from a year ago. Data center revenue was $22.6 billion, up 427% from a year ago.\n\nNvidia also declared a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7, that will make the stock even more enticing to retail investors.\n\nNVDA stock is up 89% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn many ways, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) works hand-in-hand with Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia makes the powerful GPUs that are so popular these days, Supermicro handles the server architecture and custom bundling that is so essential to allow GPUs to work with each other to perform rapid calculations.\n\nThat’s why SMCI stock has been on such an impressive run, up more than 200% so far this year.\n\nBut SMCI is also on sale — incredibly, the stock is down 20% from its April highs as investors speculated SMCI has gone up too fast, too quickly.\n\nThat’s just shortsighted thinking. Supermicro earnings have tripled from a year ago and its earnings per share are up fourfold. And as Nvidia continues to roll out upgraded GPUs, Supermicro’s server architecture will continue to be in demand.\n\nSCMI stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is looking a lot better today than it was in late 2022. That’s when META stock hit a low as engagement and monthly active viewers were on the decline.\n\nMeta seemed to be more interested in the internet of the future — the metaverse — than the here and now.\n\nGranted, being a forward-thinking company is important in the tech realm. But Meta was dumping billions into building out the metaverse and hemorrhaging stock price.\n\nFortunately, CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that 2023 would be a year where Meta would focus on profits and what makes the company successful.\n\nAnd it worked. META stock is up 91% in the last 12 months, and the company is capitalizing on AI to make advertising more effective.\n\nIt’s also creating some interested generative AI products that improve the user experience for its Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\n\nNow Meta Platforms counts roughly half the global population — nearly 4 billion people — as active monthly users. And META stock is once again one of the best tech stocks to buy. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI understand the skepticism that you may feel with this pick. But let’s make a couple of things clear. First, investing in Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) isn’t an endorsement of Donald Trump’s policies or actions, nor is it a bet that he will win the November election.\n\nSecond, it’s important to know that Trump Media is a highly speculative stock that is highly susceptible to the headlines of the day. It’s not a trade for everyone.\n\nBut if you ignore the drama that surrounds Trump Media, you’ll see that this is a trade about possibilities, not politics. X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter and now held privately by Elon Musk, is not the powerhouse that it used to be.\n\nThere is a real opportunity for an alternative to step forward — which is what Meta Platforms did with its Threads platform.\n\nRight now, Trump Media isn’t even close to making money. It will take a long time for it to scale and generate a profit.\n\nBut it may be worth a small, speculative investment today. The stock continues to have a lot of momentum behind it, which is why it still gets an “A” in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is pretty much the polar opposite of  Trump Media, which goes to prove that top-rated tech stocks to buy come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nWhile Trump Media is a startup, Dell is a legacy hardware company that makes desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nBut Dell isn’t acting like a legacy computer company. It’s one of the hottest tech stocks in the market today, with gains of 91% so far in 2024. Investors are jumping all over DELL stock because of the company’s large server business and the potential for companies to upgrade their servers to run AI applications.\n\nDell recorded fourth-quarter revenue of $22.3 billion, down 11% from a year ago. But net income of $1.15 billion was an increase of 91% from last year, and earnings per share of $1.59 was a big improvement from EPS of 84 cents in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nDELL stock is worth taking a position. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother legacy computing company that’s acting more like a young pup than a grizzled hound is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)\n\nLike Dell, IBM is leaning heavily into AI to help power its profits. The company operates its watsonx generative AI platform and has booked more than $1 billion in business related to generative AI. Its software revenue was up 6% in the first quarter of 2024, and overall revenue was up 3%.\n\nIBM is also working on some new AI assistants that are scheduled to be available later this year, and it has partnerships with some of the biggest companies in the world to make watsonx widely accessible.\n\nAnd if you’re an income investor, you have to appreciate IBM’s dividend yield of nearly 4%.\n\nIBM stock is up 5% in 2024 and is recovering nicely from a pullback in April. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf the technology stocks on this list, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is the only that can be classified as a fintech stock.\n\nCoinbase operates a cryptocurrency trading platform that makes nearly 250 different types of assets available for buying, selling or trading.\n\nAnd even if you aren’t interested in investing in cryptocurrency yourself, buying COIN stock allows you to monetize the growth of digital currency and the evolution of blockchain technology.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $1.58 billion, up from $736 million a year ago. The company also turned a profit of $1.17 billion after losing $79 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company managed to top expectations by boasting $511 million in subscription and services revenue, after forecasting a range between $410 million and $480 million.\n\nCOIN stock is up 31% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article both had long positions in NVDA and SCMI.

        "title": "Micron Technology Stock: A Great Chip Pick (Not Named Nvidia)",
        "content": "The most obvious AI pick is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but maybe it’s too obvious. For a less crowded trade, I encourage you to take a look at Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). I’ve previously set a $150 price target on Micron Technology stock and now, I expect it to reach that target fairly soon.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association Micron Technology estimates that U.S. chip-manufacturing capacity will tripleby 2032.\n\nTo seize this opportunity, it’s fine to own some Nvidia stock, but it’s smart to diversify your holdings beyond just one stock. With that in mind, let’s delve into Micron’s new chip that could be a game changer in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicron Technology’s Alphabet Soup Chip\n\nMicron Technology just unveiled a new, ultrapowerful chip that’s designed to handle intense workloads for AI applications in Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) laptops.\n\nIt’s called the Crucial LPCAMM2, and it “features LPDDR5X mobile memory to level up laptop performance for professionals and creators.”\n\nAccording to Micron, the LPCAMM2 consumes “up to 58% less active power and with a 64% space savings compared to DDR5 SODIMMs.” That’s a lot of capital letters, so I’m just going to call it the “alphabet soup chip” for now.\n\nWith a “thinner, fan-less design,” this new chip will be used in Lenovo’s ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 laptops. However, it could become the gold-standard memory chip for AI-compatible workstations (i.e., desktops and laptops).\n\nI feel that this is a significant but underreported news item that will have a positive long-term impact on Micron Technology.\n\nA Micron Technology Skeptic Turns Bullish\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I’m looking for Micron Technology stock to reach $150 in the near term. Coincidentally, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra recently set a $150 share-price target for Micron (up from $115 previously), along with an upgrade from “neutral” to “outperform.”\n\nThis is notable because Gerra had maintained a “neutral” rating on Micron Technology since March 2021. “While catching the train a bit late, we see meaningful upside opportunities ahead for Micron,” Gerra explained.\n\nBetter late than never, as the old saying goes. With this upgrade, Gerra joins the vast majority of bullish analysts covering Micron. Impressively, 24 out of 25 analysts assigned a “buy” or equivalent rating to Micron Technology stock in the past three months.\n\nCitigroup analysts reiterated their “buy” rating and assigned a $150 price target to Micron shares. So, for the time being, $150 seems to be the magic number.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology Stock: Not Named Nvidia, but Still Worth Owning\n\nIt makes sense to have some portfolio exposure to AI-enabled hardware in 2024. You can diversify your holdings in this area by investing in both Nvidia and Micron Technology.\n\n$150 is a realistic target for Micron Technology stock. So, feel free to purchase a few shares before the stock reaches that price.\n\nThen, you can start looking at new price targets as Micron Technology continues to advance its AI memory-chip technology.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Have Turned $25,000 Into More Than $1 Million in 15 Years",
        "content": "The Great Recession ended nearly 15 years ago. Buying stocks toward the end of an economic slowdown can lead to some oversize returns down the road since that usually means you're buying them at reduced prices, when optimism in the markets could still be a bit muted.\n\nIf you invested $25,000 at the end of the Great Recession in any of the stocks on this list, your investment would now be worth more than $1 million. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) have been among the best and brightest stocks over the past 15 years.\n\nHere's how much a $25,000 investment in these stocks would have grown over that time, and why they still might be good buys.\n\nNvidia: $8.2 million\n\nNvidia generated some incredible life-changing returns in 15 years, turning a $25,000 investment into a mammoth $8.2 million today. In the past year and a half, the stock has gone parabolic due to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for its chips to help develop chatbots and next-gen technologies.\n\nBut what's notable is that even before the recent surge in its share price, Nvidia still would have been a millionaire-making investment. If you invested $25,000 in the stock in June 2009 and held on until at least 2022, you still would be sitting on more than $2.6 million.\n\nThe company's chips have effectively become the standard in computing, and while AI has certainly ramped up Nvidia's growth, it was a top growth stock even before then. In the past 10 years, the only thing more impressive than the top-line growth has been that its bottom line has accelerated even faster: NVDA Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nNvidia can still make for a good buy even though its market cap is already around $2.3 trillion. Given the opportunities in AI and the important role Nvidia plays in its growth, it might not be too late to invest in this tech giant.\n\nNetflix: $2.6 million\n\nIn 2009, Netflix was still largely a DVD rental company. The big news by the end of that year was that nearly half of its subscribers were watching online streaming.\n\nToday, that's the main reason people subscribe to Netflix: to watch online, either from a computer or a mobile device. Investing in Netflix in 2009 would have involved some risk because the company was by no means a sure thing, nor were its financials as strong as they are today.\n\nNowadays, Netflix has become the example of how to create a profitable streaming business. While consumers might not be thrilled with its rate increases and crackdown on password sharing, those moves allowed the company to create a sustainable and profitable operation.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, Netflix reported net income of $5.4 billion on revenue of $33.7 billion, for a profit margin of 16%. Many other streaming businesses, meanwhile, still struggle with generating any profit at all.\n\nIt is still a leader in the streaming industry with just under 270 million paid subscribers. Although its future returns could be more modest, this can still be a good growth stock to buy and hold.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals: $1.4 million\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals has also been a top growth stock to own over the past 15 years. A $25,000 investment back then would be worth a little under $1.4 million today.\n\nAs with Netflix, Regeneron was a far riskier stock in 2009. It was unprofitable and was highly dependent on collaboration revenue. At $314 million, that accounted for 83% of Regeneron's top line.\n\nToday, the business is broader and its revenue in just the first three months of this year ($3.1 billion) easily eclipses its 2009 tally. While collaboration revenue still represents a sizable portion of Regeneron's business, the percentage is down to just 40% as the company's eye disease medication Eylea is a highly successful blockbuster drug, with $1.4 billion in revenue just this past quarter.\n\nThe company still has more than 35 product candidates in development, so there might still be a lot more growth on the horizon. And with the company generating strong free cash flow of nearly $4 billion in the trailing 12 months, Regeneron is in a great position to continue investing in growing its operations. This is a stock that still has the potential to generate strong returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Morning bid: Nvidia aces Fed, tense Taiwan and UK poll",
        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nYet another quarterly earnings beat from AI-chip behemoth Nvidia catapulted Wall St stock futures higher again on Thursday - batting away hawkish Federal Reserve meeting minutes, military tension around Taiwan and news of a July UK election.\n\nNvidia's extraordinary boom on the scramble for artificial intelligence showed little sign of faltering and its stock - which now accounts for over 5% of the entire S&P500 capitalization - soared 7% out of hours after its latest update.\n\nThe firm forecast second-quarter revenue of some $28 billion, almost $2 billion above analysts' estimates, and it announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Its shares, which have tripled over the past year, jumped above $1,000 in extended trade and added another $140 billion in stock market value.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe news has been enough to lift S&P500 futures out of Wednesday's mild funk and they were up about 0.5% ahead of Thursday's bell. Nasdaq 100 futures are up almost 1%.\n\nAnd the ongoing rise of Wall Street to ever higher records has seen implied equity volatility crater, with the VIX \"fear index\" plumbing its lowest since November 2019 on Thursday at just 11.54.\n\nPerhaps even more remarkable given the stubborn Fed noises, equivalent Treasury market volatility gauges are also subsiding and the MOVE index fell to its lowest since February 2022 - before the Fed tightening campaign started.\n\nThat may be partly due to the fact that U.S. central bank appears to prepared to leave interest rates unchanged for several more months. Indeed some private sector bankers, such as Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon, now see no rate cut this year.\n\nWhile there were signs from its latest meeting minutes on Wednesday that some hawkish policymakers were willing to lift rates again if necessary, not least due to a loosening of financial conditions evident in surging stocks, the impact was muted as the meeting was before the softer April inflation data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result U.S. Treasury yields ticked up only modestly, with rates markets now homing in on weekly jobless numbers and May business surveys later on Thursday for guidance.\n\nSoftness in housing data on Wednesday also kept up hopes for a cooling economy, and futures markets still retain 40 basis points of Fed easing for 2024 - significantly more than the 34 bps money markets now seen from the Bank of England.\n\nUK ELECTION\n\nStickiness in \"core\" UK April inflation readings on Wednesday have wiped out hopes of a June BoE rate cut and even left an August move in the balance - complicated perhaps by the surprise announcement of a British election for July 4.\n\nAlthough a win for the opposition Labour Party is widely expected - with opinion polls showing it more than 20 points clear of the ruling Conservatives, and betting markets ascribing a 90% chance to Labour leader Keir Starmer becoming prime minister - sterling volatility perked up to some degree.\n\nTwo-month implied volatility for the euro/sterling pair popped up half a point to more than 4% for the first time in a month.\n\nBut the inflation news and BoE rethink was more dominant in rates pricing, with gilt yields backing up and sterling rising to its highest in two months.\n\nThe UK stock market fell only 0.5% after the election announcement on Wednesday, although an index of UK utilities shares fell almost 6% today on possible political risk in the sector.\n\nOn the data front, euro zone May business surveys showed activity expanded at its fastest pace in a year this month - while UK equivalents slowed.\n\nIn Asia, Chinese shares underperformed with losses of more than 1% in mainland and Hong Kong shares.\n\nGeopolitical tensions kept investors nervous as China's military started two days of \"punishment\" drills held in five areas around Taiwan just days after Taiwan President Lai Ching-te took office.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that G7 finance ministers will discuss their concerns about China's excess industrial capacity and potential responses, adding that without policy changes in Beijing their economies will be hit with a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\n\"This week will be a key opportunity to discuss how China's macroeconomic imbalances and industrial overcapacity can affect our economies,\" Yellen told a news conference ahead of a Group of Seven finance meeting in Stresa, Italy.\n\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n\n* U.S. April weekly jobless claims, May flash business surveys for the U.S. and around the world from S&P Global, US April new home sales\n\n* G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meet in Stresa, Italy\n\n* Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic\n\n* U.S. corporate earnings: Intuit, Medtronic, Ross Stores, Deckers Outdoor\n\n* U.S. Treasury auctions 10-year inflation-protected securities, 4-week bills\n\n(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Alison Williams; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading at a near all-time high. On May 16 the Dow hit 40,000 for the first time in history following a favorable inflation report. Hitting this milestone is a massive deal for the venerable index and the stock market. It shows the market is still booming even in this environment of high interest rates.\n\nThe Dow comprises 30 major companies and has grown by 20% over the last year. Other stock market indices, such as the Nasdaq and S&P 500, have also performed very well over the past year, growing by 32% and 27%, respectively.\n\nHere are a few stocks in the Dow that have led the index to all-time highs. These companies are outliers with the Dow concerning their performance but should be considered solid investment opportunities nonetheless.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a company that provides customer relationship services. It uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) and similar technology to provide sales data for stores, forecasting and improved business workflow.\n\nOver the past year, CRM’s share price has risen by 36% due to strong revenue growth and increased investor interest in developing innovative technologies such as generative AI.\n\nOn Feb. 28, Salesforce released its earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. It said total revenue increased 11% year-over-year with net income of $1.4 billion. It was a nice reversal from last year when it recorded a $98 million loss. Also, free cash flow grew 27% year-over-year allowing it to buy back approximately $1.7 billion in stock.\n\nSalesforce recently initiated a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share, following other large companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nManagement guided full-year revenue for FY 2025 to be in the range of $37.7 billion to $38 billion, which would be an 8% to 9% growth year-over-year.\n\nSalesforce is a solid addition to the Dow with its technology capabilities, particularly its Einstein 1 platform, which is projected to continue being a growth catalyst in the future. It has also shown consistent share price appreciation and is among the best performers this year of companies within the Dow.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a heavy machinery and construction equipment manufacturer that produces tractors, backhoes, asphalt pavers, excavators, articulated trucks, forestry machines and similar equipment.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Apr. 25, CAT reported its earnings for the first quarter of 2024, stating total revenue remained practically unchanged and earnings per share increased by 54% to $5.75. Within the first quarter, Caterpillar announced it repurchased approximately $4.5 billion of stock.\n\nCaterpillar is a strong growth company that has performed very well, especially this year when its share price increased by 68%. It has a solid dividend yield of 1.45% and has increased its dividend annually for the last 30 years.\n\nCaterpillar has been one of the major players in the Dow’s impressive performance this year, with it reaching an all-time high of $382 per share.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers consumer finance products and services, such as credit and charge cards, banking services, expense management, fraud protection and payment processing. It sells and markets its products primarily through its online application to consumers and businesses.\n\nOver this past year, AXP’s share price has risen by 56%, primarily due to strong earnings.\n\nOn Apr. 19, American Express reported earnings for the first quarter of 2024, stating that total revenue increased 11% and net income rose 34% to $2.4 billion. AXP stated that it is experiencing strong demand for its products amongst Millennial and Gen-Z customers.\n\nAXP provides investors with a decent dividend yielding 1.15% on an annual basis. Its most recent quarterly distribution was 70 cents per share on Apr. 4, following its board of directors authorizing a 17% increase to its existing quarterly payout.\n\nAXP beat analyst expectations on its most recent earnings results. Still, it reiterated previous guidance for 2024, in which total revenue is projected to increase by 9% to 11%, and earnings per share is expected to grow by 13% to 17%.\n\nAmerican Express is a solid choice for investors seeking stocks within the Dow. Its share price has risen considerably over this past year, and growth in management projects will continue to compound.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "If the market’s dramatic shifts this year have left you feeling unsettled, you’re not alone. Despite widespread overvaluation in many tech stocks, plenty of blue-chip stocks to buy can provide the portfolio stability we all need.\n\nDuring the current rally, stocks have risen, plummeted, and risen again, pushing investors toward small-caps, tech, and growth stocks. While profitable, this strategy might not be the best long-term decision if you’re seeking continued growth alongside general stock stability, avoiding the rapid stock price swings we’ve been seeing. Instead, these blue-chip stocks to buy offer a firm foundation of long-term opportunity to anchor your portfolio.\n\nThe economic landscape remains uncertain, with inflation stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, creating general unease and uncertainty about short-term economic conditions. One adverse event, economic or otherwise, could send speculative stocks tumbling again. With this in mind, these blue-chip stocks to buy offer stability, value, and diversification to protect yourself against the worst fallout if (or when) the market takes another hit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltria (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) may trade well below pre-pandemic highs, but its hefty dividend yield and current momentum make it a blue-chip investor’s dream. The company’s current dividend yield is an impressive 9.56%, which is particularly enticing as high bond yields make fixed-income investing increasingly central to well-rounded portfolios.\n\nRecent earnings reports show that the company is on solid financial footing, ensuring upside potential while maintaining its substantial dividend distribution. Despite declining smoking rates, Altria’s diluted earnings per share grew by 21% over the quarter.\n\nSimultaneously, Altria is aggressively exploring smokeless alternatives. Adaptation is crucial for any company, but especially for Altria, which relies heavily on tobacco sales. Altria is also getting ahead of regulatory criticism by developing a first-of-its-kind Bluetooth-enabled tool to restrict underage use of smokeless tobacco products. If Altria successfully transitions into the smokeless nicotine market, it could solidify its position as the leading blue-chip stock in the wider industry.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Medtronic (MDT)\n\nThe medical stock sector experienced dramatic fluctuations during the pandemic, leaving many investors wary. Companies saw significant stock surges followed by steep declines, casting a shadow over the entire industry. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), a major player in the field, wasn’t immune to these trends, with its market capitalization nearly half what it was mid-pandemic. However, recent signs point to a strong recovery, and its 3.5% dividend yield keeps investors content while they wait for the rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\nMedtronic’s strong dividend program is particularly noteworthy in the current context. The company has a nearly 50-year history of consistently increasing its annual dividend, demonstrating a stable commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nBeyond its financials, Medtronic’s role in the medical device industry is significant. Known for its innovation and development in medical technology, the company is now focusing on more collaborative and risk-based contracting with hospital networks. These agreements aim to enhance patient outcomes and reduce costs, making Medtronic a valuable partner in an era of escalating healthcare delivery costs. Additionally, ongoing partnerships with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) keep Medtronic at the forefront of emerging health tech trends, solidifying its position as a top blue-chip stock to buy today.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for traditional oil and energy firms to add to your “blue-chip stocks to buy” list, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a perfect choice. Warren Buffett loves the stock; Buffett’s endorsement is proof enough to sway even the most skeptical investor. However, if you need more of a push to consider this blue-chip stock, recent news may mark massive upside ahead for Occidental Petroleum.\n\nLast year, Occidental Petroleum cemented its position as a sustainability-centric oil stock, as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a new partnership with a subsidiary to leverage emerging carbon capture technology. Analysts anticipate this collaboration could add up to $150 million to Amazon’s revenue by helping the retailer reduce its carbon footprint through a new direct air capture plant.\n\nThis facility is one of the first of its kind, made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $3.5 billion allocation for plant development. This initiative allows OXY to diversify its revenue streams as more corporate entities seek ways to offset their carbon emissions. As demand for sustainability continues to grow, traditional oil and gas companies must adapt. OXY stands out as one of the first blue-chip stocks in the sector to proactively embrace this trend.\n\nOXY’s overall trailing yield is a respectable 2.75%. Warren Buffett’s endorsement of the stock is a positive signal for investors, and the company’s prospects moving forward look equally promising.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few companies with unstoppable momentum amid wider economic conditions. It has grown almost 24% since January and a remarkable 225% over the past five years. Though consumers increasingly manage grocery budgets more tightly, Costco remains top-of-mind for many shoppers today.\n\nThe shift in consumer behavior is evident as shoppers have reduced spending on non-essential items while maintaining consistent purchases of essential products at Costco. Though the company’s exceptional growth during the pandemic creates a challenging baseline for ongoing expansion, management seems well-positioned to maintain momentum.\n\nAdditionally, Costco still has room to grow and untapped potential globally. Membership is rapidly growing despite the year’s economic turbulence. Management’s sensitivity to consumer and customer needs increases brand loyalty. Although activist investors have called for membership price hikes, the Chief Financial Officer has pointed to inflation and household concerns as reasons to stabilize pricing. Costco’s growth amid uncertainty and strong brand loyalty make it a consumer mainstay. It’s also a perfect blue-chip stock to buy if you want to protect your portfolio.\n\nJazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) Image of the Jazz Pharmaceuticals logo on a sign\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to capture current cannabis trends but are understandably sketched out by speculative cannabis stocks, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) is a promising blue-chip alternative. This blue-chip stock offers the stability of a legacy pharmaceutical company with one foot firmly in the medical cannabis sector. Better yet, Jazz is undergirded by a strong foundational series of treatments and medication, with the company’s daytime sleepiness and narcolepsy therapeutic, Xywav, remaining a strong performer that accounts for up to 10% of total sales. These legacy pharma initiatives provide stability as the company explores the emerging medical cannabis market driven by recent rescheduling news.\n\nJazz is set to explode as markets realize the implications of medical cannabis rescheduling, thanks to its subsidiary GW Pharmaceuticals, one of the first companies to develop and commercialize medical cannabis. This puts Jazz near the top of the national medical cannabis market, unlike many pure-play cannabis stocks focused solely on branding and distribution. By focusing on high-level initiatives, Jazz is poised to dominate the (soon to be) rapidly growing medical cannabis sector to outpace late entrants, including well-established pharmaceutical companies reacting to rescheduling.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Realty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) often tops lists of dividend stocks to own forever, and it’s easy to see why. The company’s status as a dividend aristocrat, its monthly distributions, and a 5.75% yield make it a perennial favorite. After falling nearly 20% over the past year, this dividend stock is attractively priced for long-term investors. Realty Income’s inherent stock strength remains unchanged, making it a compelling buy for those looking to compound their investment.\n\nRealty Income boasts an impressive 98% occupancy rate across its properties, with 80% of retail tenants in sectors resilient to economic downturns. Many of these tenants are in the grocery sector, with convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores also making up a substantial part of its portfolio. This creates a robust mix that is immune to all but the most severe economic downturns.\n\nThe company’s triple-net lease model transfers all operational risks and expenses, including property maintenance costs, to the tenants. This structure effectively shields Realty Income from the rising material and labor costs often accompanying higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically lasting 15 years or more, complete with renewal options, Realty Income enjoys a steady stream of rental income. Realty’s current rent recapture rate is a staggering 104.3% today, creating foundational blue-chip stock stability.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen investors think of cheap blue-chip stocks, AT&T (NYSE:T) often tops the list. Despite dipping last summer due to concerns over lead shielding, shares are rebounding as the issue appears less severe than initially thought. Yet, shares remain undervalued, trading well below pre-pandemic highs, presenting an opportunity to benefit from a potential rise back to the top.\n\nWhile blue-chip stocks, particularly in the utilities sector, often lack the innovation seen in growth stocks, AT&T stands out. This week, the company made headlines by announcing a commercial partnership with AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) to provide space-based broadband cell connectivity to customers through 2030. Although the companies have collaborated since 2018 to bring this vision to life, this move marks a significant milestone in AT&T’s goal to expand its global network by leveraging next-gen space technology.\n\nAnother key feature of Wall Street’s favorite blue-chip stocks is their dividend yield, and AT&T is a longstanding favorite among income investors. With a current dividend yield of 6.55% and a 56% payout ratio, AT&T offers income, stability, and newfound growth opportunities through its strategic partnership with AST SpaceMobile.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is now the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft, thanks to a 200% pop in its stock price over the past year, which catapulted its market cap to $2.35 trillion.\n\nNvidia owes most of its recent success to its graphics processing units (GPUs) for use in data centers. These GPUs are designed to help developers build, train, and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models. However the AI industry is rapidly expanding, and since many investors are laser-focused on Nvidia, they might be overlooking other exciting opportunities in the chip sector.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have reached a bullish consensus on Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU), both of which play an increasingly important role in the AI industry. Here's why buying shares in these two semiconductor companies might be a great idea.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU has been the go-to AI chip for data center operators, and demand has exploded over the past 18 months. It just started shipping the even more powerful H200 GPU, and customers are eagerly awaiting a new line of chips based on the company's latest Blackwell architecture that will launch closer to 2025. But demand continues to outstrip supply, which leaves the door open for competitors to take market share.\n\nAMD is stepping in to do just that. It's now shipping its MI300 lineup of data center chips, which come in two configurations. The MI300X is a pure GPU like the H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and central processing unit (CPU) technologies to create an accelerated processing unit (APU). The latter was chosen by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which will advance everything from high-energy-density physics to U.S. national defense.\n\nThe MI300 series has already won over many of Nvidia's biggest commercial customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms. Demand is so strong that AMD now expects to sell $4 billion worth of MI300 GPUs in 2024 (that forecast stood at $2 billion just a few months ago).\n\nBut AI is quickly migrating out of the data center and onto our computers and devices, and this is a segment of the market AMD already dominates. Millions of PCs fitted with its Ryzen AI CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs) have already shipped, from top manufacturers like Dell and HP. By processing AI on a device, chatbots and other AI applications can answer queries more quickly, which leads to a better user experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nRyzen AI chips are already making a noteworthy financial contribution to AMD. In the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), they drove AMD's client segment revenue to nearly $1.4 billion, an 85% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company views AI as the biggest inflection point for PCs since the dawn of the internet, which makes AMD stock a great long-term addition to any portfolio as the revolution unfolds.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts covering AMD stock, and 33 have given it the highest possible buy rating. A further six are in the overweight (bullish) camp, and nine recommend holding. Not one of them recommends selling. Based on some of the points highlighted above, the overwhelmingly bullish consensus isn't surprising.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nMicron doesn't produce CPUs or GPUs like AMD and Nvidia. Instead, it makes some of the industry's most sought-after memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are increasingly important because AI applications command more of both.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia chose Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) to power its new H200 GPU.\n\nMicron's HBM3E consumes 30% less power than competing hardware, a key consideration for data center operators. First, it keeps electricity costs down, and second, some experts believe existing U.S. power infrastructure won't be able to cope with growing demand from data centers over the next couple of years, so trimming consumption is becoming a necessity.\n\nAs a result, Micron says its high-bandwidth memory is completely sold out for 2024 already, and most of its 2025 supply is also spoken for.\n\nLike AMD, Micron benefits from AI's transition into personal computers and smartphones. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra says the chipsets inside AI-enabled computers require up to 80% more DRAM capacity than those in traditional PCs, and up to double the DRAM in mobile devices. Micron's chips are already powering the new Samsung S24 (Galaxy AI) smartphone, which comes with a number of AI features including a chat assistant, new camera tools, and innovative translation software that allows two people to converse in different languages.\n\nThe trend toward AI will lead to more complex and expensive chips, which is a tailwind for Micron's revenue. Speaking of which, the company generated $5.8 billion in revenue during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29), a 57% increase compared to the year-ago period.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "You may not realize it, but last week marked one of the most important data releases of the quarter for investors -- and I'm not talking about the highly anticipated April inflation report.\n\nMay 15 was the deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to look over the proverbial shoulders of Wall Street's greatest investors to see what they were buying and selling in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ended in March).\n\nSince the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been credited with pushing the broad-market indexes to record highs, it's only logical to examine how Wall Street's smartest billionaire investors approached these companies in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country today, including:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhat these stocks share in common is a massive outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 over the trailing-10-year period, along with well-defined competitive advantages. For instance, Alphabet's Google has maintained at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back nine years. Meanwhile, Apple has the most robust capital-return program on the planet among publicly traded companies. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it's repurchased $674 billion of its own stock. Buybacks of this magnitude can provide a hearty lift to earnings per share.\n\nHowever, billionaires have very different outlooks for these seven stocks. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, billionaires dumped shares of two Magnificent Seven stocks, while absolutely piling into another.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires sent to the chopping block: Nvidia\n\nThe first member of the Magnificent Seven that prominent billionaire investors seemingly wanted nothing to do with in the first quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia. Just as we witnessed during the fourth quarter, eight well-known billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would billionaires sell what's arguably been the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street? Aside from simple profit-taking, there are a few potential red flags that Wall Street's brightest investors may be focusing on.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia is set to face increased competition from all angles. Although it's well publicized that external competitors will be vying for graphics processing unit (GPU) market share in AI-accelerated data centers this year, the bigger threat may come from Nvidia's own top customers.\n\nInterestingly, Magnificent Seven components Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four top customers -- about 40% of net sales. Each of these companies is developing their own AI-GPUs to deploy in collaboration with Nvidia's H100 GPUs in their high-compute data centers. The internal development of AI-GPUs from other Magnificent Seven businesses strongly suggests that we're witnessing a peak in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nHistory has also been incredibly unkind to next-big-thing investment trends. Over the last three decades, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation or trend that didn't undergo a bubble-bursting event fairly early into its existence. Investors commonly overestimate the uptake and enterprise adoption of new technologies, which leads to bubbles. If the artificial intelligence bubble were to follow history and burst, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia, which saw its sales more than double last year because of AI-GPU demand.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires showed to the door: Meta Platforms\n\nThe second surprising Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires were casting aside during the quarter ended in March is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms. Nine successful billionaires -- or 10, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Meta stock, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,259,650 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,313,528 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,164,151 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (779,637 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (735,911 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (727,500 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (175,614 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (29,157 shares)\n\nThe top reason behind this selling was very likely profit-taking. Since hitting its bear market low in 2022, shares of Meta had gained close to 500%.\n\nBillionaires may also have been leery about Meta's somewhat unpredictable capital expenditure forecasts. Shares came under pressure in 2022 because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on the metaverse and augmented/virtual reality innovations. They began rallying in a big way last year when spending forecasts were reined in a bit. But based on Meta's 2024 guidance, it appears as if Zuckerberg and his team are willing to aggressively spend, once again, on AI and other innovations that may not have a sizable payoff for years to come.\n\nThe third possibility for this selling activity might be concern about the health of the U.S. economy. Meta generates nearly 98% of its sales from advertising, and ad spending is highly cyclical. The stock market is incredibly pricey at the moment, and a historic decline in M2 money supply -- the first since the Great Depression -- suggests a recession might occur in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBut unlike Nvidia, I believe billionaires will regret paring down their stakes in Meta. It owns the top social media assets worldwide (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger), and has been able to sustain strong ad pricing power in most economic climates. Meta remains one of the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, based on forward-year cash flow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire investors can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nWhile trading activity in the Magnificent Seven leaned decisively to the sell side with Nvidia and Meta, and was mixed with other constituents, the one member that billionaires absolutely couldn't stop buying is e-commerce leader Amazon. Nine billionaire investors were willing buyers of Amazon stock during the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough Amazon is best-known for its world-leading online marketplace, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income and cash flow from a couple of its faster-growing ancillary segments. It's these ancillary operations that likely attracted billionaires to buy shares of Amazon hand over fist during the March-ended quarter.\n\nArguably no operating segment is more important than cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, and is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. Best of all, cloud-service margins are significantly higher than online retail margins, which means AWS typically accounts for a majority of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are holding their own, as well, with sustained double-digit sales growth. Amazon draws more than 2 billion people to its site each month, which affords it exceptional ad-pricing power. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscriptions in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires might be Amazon's valuation. Since Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is a far better valuation metric than the traditional price-to-earnings ratio. After spending the entirety of the 2010s at a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow, Amazon can be purchased right now for just 12.4 times consensus cash flow for 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia reports strong growth as AI boom shows no sign of stopping (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia again shattered Wall Street forecasts in its long-awaited earnings report Wednesday, sending shares of the artificial intelligence darling towards a record high in pre-market trading.\n\nThe company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12 (£4.81) on revenue of $26bn (£20.43bn), a jump of 461% and 262%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nNvidia shares rose 6% to $1,007 (£791.29) in pre-market trade, peaking above the psychologically important $1,000 mark and adding about $140bn (£110bn) in stock market value.\n\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $28bn (£22bn) plus or minus 2%. That’s better than the $26.6bn (£20.9bn) analysts had expected.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance, following the company's first-quarter earnings report, CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London underperforms against European peers as UK election race begins\n\n\"People want to deploy these data centres right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\n\nHe added that demand for both platforms will outstrip supply well into next year, with the complexity of these chips also challenging the company's efforts to keep pace.\n\nNvidia also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and said it is increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share, equivalent to $0.01 on a post-split basis.\n\nTSMC (TSM)\n\nNvidia key supplier, TSMC, was higher in pre-market trading, boosted by the mega cap’s strong results.\n\nTaiwan-based TSMC, a major supplier of chips to Apple and Nvidia, is forecasting an annual revenue growth of 10% in the global semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips.\n\nTSMC has estimated that second-quarter sales may rise as much as 30% as it rides a wave of demand for semiconductors used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is a new golden age of opportunity with AI,\" said senior vice-president Cliff Hou, Reuters reported.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)\n\nSnowflake shares jumped in pre-market trading after the data analytics company gave a mixed first-quarter report.\n\nThe software firm reported quarterly revenue of $828.7m, (£651.18m) compared to the estimate of $785.89m (£617.54). However, earnings per share of $0.14 trailed analysts' expectations of $0.17.\n\nAdjusted earnings decreased 6% year-over-year while sales increased 33%.\n\nLooking ahead, Snowflake expects second-quarter product revenue to range from $805m (£632.56m) to $810m (£636.49m) versus the estimate of $787.5m (£618.81m). It also projects full-year product revenue of $3.3bn (£2.5bn) versus the estimate of $3.26bn (£2.56bn).\n\nRead more: UK inflation falls to 2.3% in April inching closer to Bank of England target\n\n\"Our core business is very strong,\" Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy said. \"Our AI products, now generally available, are generating strong customer interest. They will help our customers deliver effective and efficient AI-powered experiences faster than ever.\"\n\nNationwide (NBS.L)\n\nNationwide Building Society has reported a statutory pre-tax profit of £1.8bn for the year to April 4, down about a fifth from the £2.2bn reported this time last year.\n\nAlthough this figure is down 20% from an all-time high of £2.23bn the year before, it is still higher compared to a £1.6bn profit in 2022.\n\nThe building society said the decline in profit this year was mainly driven by it passing on better interest rates to savers and delivering value to its members.\n\nThe lender gave out £344m to eligible members in June last year through its fairer share loyalty scheme - and it will be making a second payment this year.\n\nBritain's biggest building society will pay 3.85 million eligible members £100 this summer, a move that will cost £385m. Members will receive the payment directly into current accounts in June.\n\nWatch:Nvidia CEO: Customers are buying now, not waiting for the next chip<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-pops-4-after-earnings-beat-forecasts-announces-stock-split-and-dividend-hike-202405628.html\\\">topped Wall Street expectations </a>on both the top and bottom lines.

        "title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Can Still Rise Despite Sitting at the Top",
        "content": "Numero Uno stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a $3 trillion market cap, has delivered a return of around 1,154% over the last decade. Sitting at the top of the global stock markets, will it continue to give similar returns in the next decade? I believe the answer is yes. Microsoft’s consistently strong performance, cloud & AI-driven tailwinds, and robust margins despite substantial AI investments make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll take advantage of any market weakness in the coming months to purchase MSFT.\n\nMicrosoft’s Recent Results Were Strong Yet Again\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft reported impressive Fiscal Q3 results for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all business segments. Q3 adjusted earnings of $2.94 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $2.82 per share. Also, earnings jumped 20% year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.45 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, revenues soared 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion. The Intelligent Cloud business segment, encompassing Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and Windows, among others, grew 23% year-over-year to $26.7 billion, beating expectations yet again. The much-watched segment now comprises 35% of total revenues, with AI playing a significant role as a catalyst driving growth.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of AI by businesses, there is a substantial demand for Microsoft’s Azure and related cloud services. Not surprisingly, Azure and other cloud services witnessed solid revenue growth of 31% (28% in constant currency), significantly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nDespite the strong Q3 performance, Microsoft provided a conservative outlook, slightly below expectations. Fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to be $64 billion compared to consensus expectations of $64.5 billion, with Azure revenues expected to grow between 30% and 31%.\n\nOn a positive note, Microsoft offered its FY2025 outlook, anticipating double-digit growth in both revenues and operating income. This forecast reassures investors of the company’s sustained growth trajectory.\n\nAI Will Continue to Act as a Long-Term Catalyst for MSFT\n\nAI has propelled Microsoft to become the largest stock in the world, and it will continue to be the driving force behind its growth story in the coming decade. Microsoft’s early investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT has positioned it ahead of other tech giants.\n\nThe demand for AI remains insatiable, with Microsoft management stating that it exceeds available capacity. This high demand drives continuous heavy investment in AI by Microsoft and other tech titans.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s AI investment plans align with those of its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the space. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported CAPEX (capital expenditures) of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) spent $6.72 billion. Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Microsoft reported a 22% sequential jump in CAPEX (including finance leases) to $14 billion versus $11.5 billion in the prior quarter. The majority of that amount is assigned to scaling its AI infrastructure and securing processors from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for running large AI models.\n\nIncreasing CAPEX may impact margins. However, Microsoft’s management is taking the initiative to keep costs low and protect margins. For instance, newer and more efficient AI products like GPT-4o and Mai-1 are expected to increase scale and keep costs under control. Furthermore, Mai-1 will compete with major rivals, namely Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nAzure AI Services, which includes AI training and other AI-related services, is experiencing remarkable growth. Azure competes directly with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Google’s cloud business and is closely watched by investors. Notably, Azure AI Services is now estimated to be an over $4 billion run rate business. For comparison (although not a direct comparison), Amazon’s AWS has reached a $100 billion annual run rate. This underscores the substantial opportunity for Azure powered by AI in the coming years.\n\nDuring the earnings call, management confirmed that Azure continues to gain market share, with 65% of Fortune 500 companies using Azure Open AI. There’s a clear acceleration in Azure’s growth, marked by the signing of large deals across several diverse industries, with names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) being added to its clientele. Azure will likely continue to see the growth momentum with increased market share gains in the coming months.\n\nFurther, Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI-backed online assistant) is showing steady adoption. Management stated that 60% of Fortune 500 companies now use the Copilot AI program. The company remains optimistic about its growing contribution to revenues in the coming years.\n\nIt’s not just Azure and Copilot. Microsoft’s AI investments and capabilities are expected to boost revenues and profitability across other product portfolios, such as GitHub, Fabric, and Security.\n\nOn a separate note, MSFT’s acquisition of gaming software rival Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will continue to add to MSFT’s diversified revenue stream. Microsoft recently announced the unveiling of its own mobile store game, equivalent to Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google’s Play Store.\n\nMicrosoft’s Valuation Isn’t Cheap but Isn’t Expensive Either\n\nDespite being the most valuable stock in the world, Microsoft’s valuation isn’t as expensive as one would think. At first glance, It may look expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37x currently. Nonetheless, I believe the premium is justified, given its favorable industry-leading market position, robust margins, diversified revenue stream, and huge exposure to high-growth AI and cloud businesses.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, online retail and cloud computing giant Amazon is trading at a P/E of 51x, while social networking company Meta Platforms is trading at a 27x P/E.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Microsoft stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the earnings report. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past month. Microsoft stock’s average price target of $491.56 implies 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying MSFT for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm, and Microsoft continues to lead the charge. Microsoft’s early investments in AI have positioned it as a frontrunner in the industry, yielding significant rewards. I believe that Microsoft’s GenAI innovations will continue to drive revenues, profits, and cash flows in the coming years.\n\nWith a long runway for growth and profitability ahead, Microsoft remains a compelling investment. I plan to keep adding MSFT to my portfolio, taking advantage of any market weaknesses in the coming months.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia's blowout results, OpenAI-News Corp content deal - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures move higher, with traders assessing the implications of a fresh quarter of soaring returns from artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The semiconductor group's revenue spikes by 262% and Chief Executive Jensen Huang hints that the figure will be further boosted by this year by the upcoming launch of its newest line of AI chips. Elsewhere, OpenAI strikes its a content sharing deal with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), its latest such agreement with a major news publisher.\n\n1. Futures rise following blockbuster Nvidia results\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed higher on Thursday, as investors digested yet another blowout quarterly earnings release from artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nBy 03:43 ET (07:43 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had gained 27 points or 0.5%, Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 158 points or 0.8%, and Dow futures had climbed by 30 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe main indices ended the previous session in the red, weighed down by minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting that showed policymakers at the U.S. central bank believe inflation will only ease slowly back down to their 2% target. Although recent economic data have hinted at a cooldown in price pressures, several Fed officials this week have also said that they still would like to see more evidence that the decline is sustainable before rolling out any potential interest rate cuts.\n\nWagers that the Fed will slash rates by at least 25 basis points as soon as September dipped slightly, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) closely-monitored FedWatch Tool.\n\n2. Nvidia's latest blowout returns\n\nShares in Nvidia gained more than 6% in extended hours trading after the semiconductor group's much-anticipated first-quarter results soared and its chief executive touted skyrocketing demand for its upcoming AI-optimized chip.\n\nRevenue in the three months to April 30 soared by 262% from a year ago to $26 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $24.7 billion. In the current quarter, Nvidia expects to the top-line figure to continue growing to $28 billion. Analysts had pencilled in a quarterly forecast of $26.8 billion.\n\nData center revenue, which roughly reflects the performance of its AI chips, spiked by 427% year-on-year to a record $22.6 billion. Nvidia's data center graphics processing units have become essential parts of the computing power undergirding generative AI products.\n\n\"The next industrial revolution has begun,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang later told investors that the company will be boosted by \"a lot\" of revenue this year from its Blackwell line of chips, hinting that there will be no let-up in AI demand.\n\nThe prospected of a sustained boom bolstered Nvidia's Asian suppliers, including memory chip manufacturers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), as well as contract semiconductor firm TSMC.\n\n3. OpenAI, News Corp sign content sharing deal\n\nNews Corp's A shares jumped in extended hours trade after the media giant and OpenAI had signed a deal granting the ChatGPT-maker access to some of its biggest publications.\n\nUnder the deal, OpenAI will be given access to new and archived content from several publications, including The Wall Street Journal, The Times,The New York Post and Marketwatch.\n\nThe two did not announce any financial details of the agreement. But The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp, said the deal was valued at over $250 million over the span of five years.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI has been pushing to shore up ties with several major media outlets, including the Financial Times, as it hunts for content to train its flagship AI models.\n\nStill, OpenAI has also drawn scrutiny over its allegedly unauthorized usage of data to train its models. The New York Times sued the company in late-2023, accusing it of copyright infringement.\n\n4. DOJ to seek breakup of Live Nation and Ticketmaster - reports\n\nShares of Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:NYSE:LYV) sank in after hours trade on Wednesday on reports that the U.S. Department of Justice was planning to sue the Ticketmaster-parent over antitrust violations.\n\nThe DOJ and a group of states were preparing the lawsuit, which could be filed in the Southern District of New York as soon as Thursday, Bloomberg News reported, citing people close to the matter.\n\nLive Nation shares sank as much as 9.3% to $92 after the report, although they have since pared back some of those losses.\n\nThe lawsuit is set to bring up multiple antitrust violations by Ticketmaster over its seemingly unrivaled hold on concert ticket sales, the report said. The claim will seek remediation, with a break-up of Live Nation and Ticketmaster being a point of focus.\n\n5. Crude slips\n\nCrude prices fell marginally, dropping for the fourth consecutive session, as the Fed minutes pointed to U.S. interest rates remaining at elevated levels for some time.\n\nBy 03:43 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.1% lower at $77.47 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.1% to $81.86 a barrel.\n\nHigher interest rates increase borrowing costs, possibly placing a crimp on economic growth and oil demand in the world's largest crude consuming nation.\n\nAlso denting sentiment were U.S. crude stocks, which rose by 1.8 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts had estimated a 2.5 million-barrel draw.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia's blowout results, OpenAI-News Corp content deal - what's moving markets\n\nUS Biden administration says it supports an independent Fed\n\nLebanon's reforms insufficient for recovery, IMF says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely higher Thursday, as investors digested the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve minutes, earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and eurozone economic activity data.\n\nAt 03:20 ET (07:20 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. dropped 0.1%.\n\nFed minutes express inflation concern\n\nThe minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting, released late Wednesday, showed officials at the U.S. central bank remained concerned about U.S. inflation.\n\nWhile the minutes pointed to the central bank keeping rates high for longer, they had been preceded by a string of speeches from Fed officials suggesting sticky inflation was likely to delay any potential rate cuts.\n\nBack in Europe, the European Central Bank is widely expected to cut interest rates in June, but there remains uncertainty over how many more cuts the central bank will authorize this year.\n\nFlash Purchasing Managers Index figures in the eurozone will take center stage on Thursday, and investors will be looking for signs of growth.\n\nElsewhere, the U.K. market is also in the spotlight after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced late Wednesday that a general election will be held on July 4.\n\nNvidia shines in first quarter\n\nIn corporate news, Nvidia reported strong first-quarter earnings, and the chipmaker also offered robust revenue guidance for the current quarter.\n\nThe firm also announced a 10-for-one stock split, and said it was raising its quarterly dividend by 150% to 1 cent per share, on a post-split basis.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown (LON:HRGV) stock soared 12% after the fund manager rejected an offer from a consortium led by private equity giant CVC.\n\nWizz Air (LON:WIZZ) stock rose almost 5% after the budget airline said that it returned to profit in the year to the end of March amid \"sustained\" demand.\n\nCrude falls after Fed minutes\n\nCrude prices fell, dropping for the fourth consecutive session, as the Fed minutes pointed to U.S. interest rates remaining at elevated levels for some time.\n\nBy 03:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% lower at $77.34 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $81.72 per barrel.\n\nHigher interest rates boost borrowing costs, crunching funds that could boost economic growth and oil demand in the world's largest oil consuming nation.\n\nAlso weighing on the market, U.S. crude stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared with an estimate for a 2.5 million-barrel draw.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, gold futures rose 1.1% to $2,366.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0812.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks largely higher; Nvidia earnings, PMI data in focus\n\nAhold Delhaize bets on AI and digital to boost earnings and savings\n\nChinaâ€™s Lenovo extends revenue growth streak, beats expectations\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian equities were set for a mixed open Thursday as results for Nvidia Corp. supported tech stocks in late trading. An index of dollar strength touched a one-week high as US yields rose.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Flight Routes Suffer the World’s Worst Turbulence Citi Trader Got 711 Warning Messages Before Sparking Flash Crash Nvidia Forecast Shatters Estimates as AI Boom Stays Strong One Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence\n\nEquity futures for Australia and Hong Kong fell, while those for Japan rose. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% while the Nasdaq 100 was little changed Wednesday. Post-market results for Nvidia sent its shares as much as 7% higher in after-hours trading in New York.\n\nThe chip giant said second-quarter revenue will be about $28 billion — beating estimates. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents a share.\n\n“Even in the face of huge expectations, the company once again stepped up and delivered,” said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group, who highlighted strong data center revenue.\n\nSelling in Treasuries pushed yields higher at the front end of the curve on Wednesday. The 10-year yield was little changed, but the policy-sensitive two-year year rose four basis points as the latest Federal Reserve minutes showed officials remain in no rush to cut rates.\n\n“Many” Fed officials expressed uncertainty over the degree to which policy is restraining the economy — but the minutes also noted policy “was seen as restrictive.” The move in yields supported the greenback with the Bloomberg dollar index rising to a one-week high.\n\nElsewhere, the yen was little changed early Thursday after falling against the dollar to the lowest level since late April, while Japanese 10-year sovereign bond yields were at 1%.\n\nA busy day of economic reports in Asia includes inflation and gross domestic product figures for Singapore, inflation expectations for Australia, and China’s April Swift payments data. South Korea will hand down a monetary policy decision, while markets in Indonesia are closed.\n\nTech Profits\n\nUS tech earnings so far have been among the strongest in the first-quarter reporting season, with revisions in the sector outpacing the rest of the market. However, earnings results also suggest a broadening market, according to Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\n“We stay positive on the AI trend and maintain our preference for big tech given the advantageous market positions,” she said. “We forecast global tech earnings growth of 20% and 16% this year and next, respectively, led by the semiconductor sector where we see investment opportunities.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTo Tom Essaye at the Sevens Report, Nvidia is still the most-important single stock in the market. But more importantly, the market broadening is an ongoing phenomenon and one we think can continue as long as Goldilocks is here.\n\n“Ensuring balanced exposure to that broadening is one way we think investors can continue to outperform in 2024,” he noted.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Shares of Nvidia’s Asian suppliers rose on Thursday, cheered by the prospect of sustained demand from the artificial intelligence industry as the chipmaker clocked stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged to a record high in aftermarket trade, after its first-quarter earnings beat expectations and as the firm also offered robust revenue guidance for the current quarter.\n\nThe firm also announced a 10-for-one stock split.\n\nGains in Nvidia’s shares spilled over into its Asian suppliers. SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which is a key supplier of memory chips to the firm, rose 2.4%.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), which is also set to begin supplying high-bandwith memory chips to Nvidia, rose 0.9%.\n\nIn Taiwan, contract chipmaker TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), which is by far Nvidia’s largest supplier, rose 1.4%, while contract electronics maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317), also known as Foxconn, added 1.6%.\n\nIn Japan, semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857), which is heavily exposed to Nvidia, added 3.5%.\n\nTechnology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984) rose more than 3%, tracking aftermarket gains in its chip designing unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), which is also exposed to Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s strong earnings signaled that AI-driven demand for chips remained strong, and was likely to remain robust in the coming months as the industry grows.\n\nThe rush into generative AI, which was triggered by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late-November, has been a key driver of demand for the chip industry, which was otherwise grappling with a pronounced slowdown in technology investment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia Asian suppliers rise on positive Q1 earnings, outlook\n\nAsian stocks sink as US-China trade jitters offset Nvidia tech boost\n\nFire breaks out at Redwood City metal recycling plant in California\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Thursday with Chinese markets leading declines as a trade war with the U.S. appeared to be heating up, while fears of higher interest rates also weighed on sentiment.\n\nStill, some chipmaking stocks rose tracking positive earnings from Nvidia.\n\nRegional markets took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, which fell in overnight trade after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s late-April meeting showed increasing concerns among policymakers over sticky inflation. Some policymakers also expressed readiness to hike rates further to bring inflation down- a trend that bodes poorly for risk-driven stock markets.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose in Asian trade, buoyed by blowout earnings from market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nChinese markets tumble from recent peaks on US trade fears\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes slid about 0.9% each on Thursday, pulling back further from their highest levels in 2024.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index saw even steeper losses, sinking 1.8% after surging to a nine-month high earlier in May.\n\nLosses in China were driven by renewed concerns over a trade war with the U.S., after President Joe Biden’s administration said new tariffs on about $18 billion worth of Chinese imports will be imposed from August 1.\n\nThe tariffs are targeted at key upcoming Chinese sectors, including electric vehicles and semiconductors.\n\nBeijing appeared to have retaliated to the tariffs by banning trade activities related to China by some U.S. companies, as well as the shipment of some arms to Taiwan. Reports also said that Boeing’s plane deliveries to China were facing delays due to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSentiment towards China was also rattled by the country performing military drills close to Taiwan, which could worsen tensions in the region.\n\nOther Chinese-exposed markets retreated. Australia’s ASX 200 fell 0.6% as purchasing managers index data also showed some softening in business activity.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI was flat even as some local chipmaking stocks rose on optimism over Nvidia.\n\nThe Bank of Korea kept interest rates steady as widely expected, and hiked its economic growth forecast for the year.\n\nJapanese stocks rise on strong PMIs, tech strength\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8%, while the broader TOPIX added 0.4%.\n\nPMI data showed Japan’s manufacturing sector returned to growth for the first time in 11 months, boosting overall activity.\n\nBut technology stocks- specifically chipmakers- were the biggest drivers of Japanese stock gains on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech, chipmakers gain on Nvidia cheer\n\nAsian technology stocks saw some gains, while chipmakers surged tracking strong earnings and guidance from Nvidia, which reaffirmed hopes that demand from the artificial intelligence industry remained strong.\n\nMemory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which is a key Nvidia supplier, rose 2.7%.\n\nJapanese semiconductor testing equipment maker, Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857), which is also heavily exposed to Nvidia, rose 3.3%, while peers Renesas Electronics Corp (TYO:6723) and Lasertec Corp (TYO:6920) rose over 3% each.\n\nIn Taiwan, top Nvidia supplier TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) rose 1.2%, while electronics supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317), also known as Foxconn, added 1.5%.\n\nElsewhere, futures for India's Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, on pressure from concerns over U.S. rates.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks sink as US-China trade jitters offset Nvidia tech boost\n\nSingapore Airlines shares slip 1.3% after turbulent flight\n\nUS DOJ could seek break up of Live Nation, Bloomberg News reports\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Announces a 10-for-1 Stock Split. Here's What Investors Need to Know.",
        "content": "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have captured the public imagination over the past year or so. One of the byproducts of this trend has been the surging stock prices of companies at the forefront of this paradigm shift in technology. Nowhere is this more apparent than with chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), whose graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for AI.\n\nThe company's consistent execution and unrivaled business performance have fueled its meteoric ascent. Nvidia stock has gained 540% since early last year, driven by triple-digit revenue and profit growth resulting from surging demand for AI. Yet that's just the beginning. Since Nvidia's IPO in early 1999, the stock has soared from a split-adjusted price of $0.25 to more than $939, representing eye-popping gains of 375,500%.\n\nOn Wednesday, in conjunction with the release of the company's quarterly results, Nvidia announced plans to split its stock for the first time since July 2020. The stock has gained more than 800% in the nearly four years since, which is likely the catalyst for the split. This revelation is sparking a fresh wave of interest in an already well-followed stock. Let's review the mechanics of a stock split and what it means for investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe stock-split details\n\nNvidia announced that its board of directors had approved a 10-for-1 forward stock split. This will result from an amendment to the company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which Nvidia says \"will result in a proportionate increase of the number of shares of authorized common stock.\"\n\nAs a result of this split, shareholders of record as of June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of stock for each share they own after the market close on Friday, June 7. The stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10.\n\nNvidia investors won't need to take any steps in order to receive the additional shares of stock. Brokerage firms and investment banks handle the particulars, with the adjustments being handled behind the scenes. The stock-split shares will simply appear in investor accounts with no further action necessary. The timing can vary from brokerage to brokerage, so investors shouldn't worry if the newly issued shares aren't there immediately on June 7, as it can take hours, or in some cases days, for the additional shares to make an appearance.\n\nAdding numbers can provide context regarding how the stock-split process plays out. For each share of Nvidia stock a shareholder owns -- it's currently trading for roughly $950 per share (as of this writing) -- post-split, investors will hold 10 shares worth $95 each.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs a stock split a good thing?\n\nAs the above example shows, the total value of ownership won't change based on the split alone; it's merely a different way of viewing the whole. Put another way, if you buy a pizza, it doesn't matter if you cut it into eight slices or 16 slices -- the total amount of pizza remains the same. By the same token, Nvidia stockholders will simply have a greater number of lower-priced shares.\n\nThere are those who believe that investor psychology will ultimately play a part, with excitement about the upcoming stock split driving up the share price. It's also been suggested that the lower share price can increase demand for those shares among retail investors. Indeed, management notes in the announcement that the purpose of the split is to \"make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" While that's frequently the case, that kind of temporary euphoria historically subsides, leaving investors to focus on what matters -- the company's operational and financial performance -- which will ultimately drive the stock price higher or lower.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nWhile the stock split alone isn't reason enough to buy Nvidia, there are plenty of reasons the semiconductor specialist is a buy. Investors need to look no further than the company's financial report for evidence to support that contention.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia reported revenue that soared 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, marking an 18% quarter-over-quarter increase. This drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 461% to $6.12.\n\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $24.65 billion and EPS of $5.59, so Nvidia sailed past expectations with ease.\n\nIf there was any doubt, robust demand for generative AI fueled record data center revenue of $22.6 billion, up 427% year over year and representing 87% of Nvidia's total sales.\n\nAnother important announcement for shareholders is that Nvidia increased its quarterly dividend by 150%, from $0.04 to $0.10 per share, or $0.01 on a post-split basis. The first increased dividend payment will be made on June 28. Even at the new, higher level, the yield will still be paltry, amounting to just four-tenths of 1%.\n\nIt's still very early in the AI revolution, which is even more reason to be optimistic. The worldwide AI market clocked in at $2.4 trillion in 2023 and is expected to rise to $30.1 trillion -- a compound annual growth rate of 32% -- by 2032, according to Expert Market Research. As the gold standard for GPUs used in AI, Nvidia is well positioned for future success.\n\nInvestors shouldn't buy shares for the pending stock split. However, Nvidia's long track record of consistently strong operating and financial results -- and blistering stock price gains -- show why it continues to be such a winning investment.\n\nSome investors will balk at Nvidia's valuation, but you get what you pay for. Despite four consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue and EPS growth, Nvidia stock is selling for 37 times forward earnings. That's a small price to pay for such robust growth.\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Forecast Shatters Estimates as AI Boom Stays Strong",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the center of an artificial intelligence boom, gave another bullish sales forecast, showing that spending on AI computing remains strong.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Flight Routes Suffer the World’s Worst Turbulence Citi Trader Got 711 Warning Messages Before Sparking Flash Crash One Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence Barclays Managers Warn Some Staff to Prepare for Five Days a Week in Office\n\nSecond-quarter revenue will be about $28 billion, the company said Wednesday. Analysts on average had predicted $26.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Results in the fiscal first quarter, which ran through April, also beat projections.\n\n“The next industrial revolution has begun,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement, echoing one of his favorite themes. “AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.”\n\nThe upbeat outlook reinforces Nvidia’s status as the biggest beneficiary of AI spending. The company’s so-called AI accelerators — chips that help data centers develop chatbots and other cutting-edge tools — have become a hot commodity in the past two years, sending its sales soaring. Nvidia’s market valuation has skyrocketed as well, topping $2.3 trillion.\n\nThe shares rose about 3% in extended trading on Wednesday. They had already gained 92% this year through the close, fueled by investor hopes that the company would continue to shatter expectations.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 cents a share.\n\n“We are poised for our next wave of growth,” Huang said.\n\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, started as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. His recognition that the company’s chips were well-suited to developing artificial intelligence software helped open a new market — and gave him a jump on competitors.\n\nThe release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022 then sparked a race between major technology companies to build their own AI infrastructure. The scramble made Nvidia’s H100 accelerators a must-have product. They sell for tens of thousands of dollars per chip and are often in scarce supply.\n\nBut much of this new revenue has come from a small handful of customers. A group of four companies — Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — are Nvidia’s largest buyers and account for about 40% of sales. Huang, 61, is trying to spread his bets by producing complete computers, software and services — aimed at helping more corporations and government agencies deploy their own AI systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Nvidia’s revenue more than tripled to $26 billion. Excluding certain items, profit was $6.12 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $24.7 billion and earnings of $5.65 a share.\n\nNvidia’s data-center division — now by far its largest source of sales — generated $22.6 billion of revenue. Gaming chips provided $2.6 billion. Analysts had given targets of $21 billion for the data-center unit and $2.6 billion for gaming.\n\n(Updates with more from report in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won What Neuralink’s First Patient Is Thinking Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday, led chiefly by technology stocks after positive earnings and guidance from market darling Nvidia sparked a rally in the sector.\n\nOptimism over the firm, which is considered as a bellwether for tech and artificial intelligence demand, largely overshadowed persistent concerns over sticky U.S. inflation and high interest rates- which were furthered by the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s late-April meeting.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,340.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.5% to 18,872.00 points by 20:04 ET (00:04 GMT). Dow Jones Futures lagged, falling 0.1% to 39,739.0 points.\n\nNvidia surges on positive Q1, boosts chipmaking shares\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rallied as much as 6% in aftermarket trade, reaching a record high of $1,006.95 a share after its first quarter earnings blew past estimates. The firm also offered up a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, as it continued to benefit from strong demand in the growing AI industry.\n\nNvidia also announced a 10-for-one forward stock split.\n\nThe chipmaker’s earnings signaled that demand from the AI industry remained strong, which in turn boosted shares of other major chipmakers. Peers Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) rose about 2% each, while Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) added 0.5%.\n\nMemory chip maker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) rose 2.4%, while chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) rose 3.2%.\n\nGains in Nvidia spilled over into the broader tech sector.\n\nFed jitters limit optimism, Wall St falls\n\nBut while positive earnings from Nvidia heralded gains for tech stocks, broader equities remained skittish amid growing concerns over high for longer interest rates, especially after repeated warnings from the Fed on sticky inflation.\n\nThe minutes of the central bank’s meeting cemented fears that the Fed was growing less confident that inflation was moving sustainably back towards its 2% annual target.\n\nA string of Fed officials also echoed this notion in recent weeks. While markets were still holding out hope for a September rate cut, future inflation readings are likely to determine the possibility of such a scenario.\n\nWall Street indexes closed lower on Wednesday amid this angst. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% to 5,307.01 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.2% to 16,801.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5% to 39,671.04 points, with all three indexes falling from record highs hit earlier in the week.\n\nAdding to concerns over high rates, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he did not expect any rate cuts in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAftermarket moves: Live Nation sinks on report of DOJ lawsuit\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) sank as much as 9% on a report that the Department of Justice was planning a lawsuit against the firm over allegedly monopolistic practices by its Ticketmaster unit, and that lawmakers were also seeking a separation of Ticketmaster from the firm.\n\nNews Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) surged over 4% after it signed a content sharing deal with OpenAI, granting the latter access to content from several of its biggest publications.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as Nvidia cheer offsets Fed jitters\n\nBoeing targets June 1 for Starliner's debut crew launch amid helium leak probe\n\nBHP shares fall after Anglo American rejects third proposal, extends bid deadline\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The cloud computing boom may have lost a bit of its luster as an investing theme since the glorious rise of generative artificial intelligence (gen AI). Undoubtedly, we’ve all gotten used to all the benefits of connecting to the cloud (or a remote data center). Many of us have taken the cloud for granted, as many application developers have already made the transition.\n\nIn these early innings of AI’s rise, many powerful large language models (LLMs) will need to run on remote data centers. As the number of parameters swells in size, it’s clear that the most powerful LLMs will find their home in the cloud. In the coming quarters, we’ll start seeing smaller, perhaps shrunk-down LLMs finding their home in our own local hardware. There are benefits to running AI both in the cloud and on the edge (our devices).\n\nIn this piece, we’ll focus on three undervalued cloud computing stocks that are innovating on gen AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud pioneer hard at work on next-generation AI products that can add value in the enterprise. As a top cloud and AI company still led by one of its founders, Marc Benioff, I’d not overlook the name as it looks to keep breaking boundaries with innovation. At this pace, I view Salesforce as an underrated technology darling that should get as much love as the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to AI in the cloud, it’s all about getting the most power and smarts out of a model. Salesforce’s Einstein Copilot isn’t just another AI assistant that can do a wide range of fun things; it’s a cloud AI that could help bring clients even closer to their customers. Indeed, adding AI across the suite could help its clients gain an even larger edge over their rivals.\n\nWhether that’s in the form of more sales, better time management, or cost savings, Salesforce is one of the cloud AI firms that could see considerable gains as their gen AI investments begin to pay off over the next four years. Benioff and company are playing the long-term game, making CRM stock a great buy-and-hold type of name.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is another firm that’s benefited greatly from its prior transition into the cloud. Nowadays, it’s looking to embed gen AI across its many tools. While AI has also paved the way for new rivals, I believe Adobe is innovating on AI at such a pace that it will retain its lead in the creative software scene.\n\nRecently, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been rolling out gen AI across various applications within its Windows OS. Even Microsoft Paint has been given an AI jolt with some impressive new features, including image generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs intriguing as the Paint upgrades are, the application is still not at the same level as some of Adobe’s offerings, like Photoshop and Illustrator. If anything, I expect continued AI upgrades across Adobe’s suite could help it pull further ahead of other players in the creative software market.\n\nWhether we’re talking about the new Adobe Firefly model or AI additions across the slate, ADBE stock is an underrated and overlooked AI stock while it’s down 30% from its peak. It’s about time investors had given CEO Shantanu Narayen the benefit of the doubt when it comes to his firm’s new AI trajectory.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have public cloud service firm Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is in great shape to capitalize on the cloud AI boom. Undoubtedly, enterprises are going to want access to the most powerful AI models. This entails cloud-based AI rather than edge AI, the latter of which is better suited for consumers who value privacy over AI smarts.\n\nWith Amazon’s custom chips and the newest Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPUs coming to Amazon data centers, it’s clear has enough medium-term catalysts to justify hanging onto the stock as it looks to break out past $185 per share.\n\nThough Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Adam Selipsky stepped down more than a week ago, I wouldn’t make too much of the matter. Amazon is primed (forgive the pun) to seize the AI cloud opportunity at hand. And at 51.3 times trailing price-to-earnings, I still view the tech juggernaut as pretty cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.

        "title": "3 Chip Stocks to Buy to Invest in AI’s Brain",
        "content": "Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.\n\nThis marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.\n\nChip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks. Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom’s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.\n\nMost recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBroadcom’s inclusion in Barclays’ list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry’s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company’s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.\n\nBarclays’ attention to AI’s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company’s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a leading global innovative memory and storage solutions provider. Micron’s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix’s (OTC:HXSCL). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.\n\nThe brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It’s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States’ largest memory chip manufacturer.\n\nThe upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from “Underweight” to “Equalweight” and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 — an increase of over 32%.\n\nBaird’s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.\n\nThis slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron’s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron’s production of HBM3E, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website.

(NASDAQ:SMCI), known as Supermicro, is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server technology and innovation. The company provides advanced server solutions, storage systems, and cloud computing technologies.\n\nWall Street analysts recently highlighted SMCI as one of the top chip stocks to buy, describing the stock as the “Switzerland of AI” following the company’s announcement of another set of strong quarterly results. Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company’s AI dynamics are “a sweet spot for the company’s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.“\n\nSimilarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro’s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company’s building block architecture.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Is a Mainstay at AI Events This Spring",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at it again. Around this time last year we noted an event cluster was forming around the artificial intelligence darling, meaning they were participating in nearly every large tech and AI event during the very busy Spring conference season. Nearly all of those events saw CEO Jensen Huang with a key speaking role, and came on the heels of a smashing fiscal first-quarter 2024 earnings report. The lead into the fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings call is just as busy, but this year Nvidia is being mentioned in rooms even when they aren't physically present as conference participants.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nWall Street Horizon has found that while a standalone event such as a company's upcoming earnings release date may affect volatility, investigating multiple events closely in relationship to one another can have a stronger impact on a company's corporate financial health. Observing the information pre-event, during the event and post-event and how they interact is critical to understand how events relate to trading and risk strategies. Currently we see a notable event cluster lining up for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is working the May conferencecircuit - Whether in attendance or not\n\nNot only has Nvidia been busy as participants on the May conference circuit, speaking at the RSA Cybersecurity Conference in San Francisco on May 6-9, as well as the Macquarie Asia Conference on May 13 in Hong Kong, but they are being praised at other highly watched AI events where they aren't even necessarily in attendance.\n\nAt the onset of the AI event cluster last week, OpenAI demoed their latest update of their generative AI product for consumers, GPT - 4o, on Monday, May 13. Their chief technology officer, Mira Murati, thanked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for bringing us the most advanced chips to make that presentation possible.[1]\n\nThen on Tuesday, May 14, Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) held their annual developer conference. At that event, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also gave Nvidia a shoutout. He referenced their longstanding partnership and revealed that Google Cloud will begin using the chipmaker's Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) in early 2025.[2]\n\nMay 21-23 - Microsoft Build 2024 (Redmond, WA)This week, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds its annual Build conference in Redmond, Washington from May 21 - 23. Nvidia again will be at the center of attention as MSFT provides servers to OpenAI and is expected to announce the latest updates to its AI suite which utilizes Nvidia's GPUs.[3] Many of Nvidia's top talent are featured speakers at the event, including Adel El Hallak, senior director of Product Management for Enterprise AI, Ganesh Sivaraman, director of Omniverse Partnerships, and Jesse Clayton, director of Product Management and Product Marketing, Windows AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nMay 22 - Fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings report and conference call (2:00PM PT)This will all be taking place as Nvidia readies itself to report first-quarter earnings later today, with a webcast to follow at 5:00PM ET. According to FactSet data, they are expected to post bottom-line growth of 414% and revenue growth of 242%, making it one of the biggest contributors to S&P 500 growth this season.\n\nJune 26 - Annual shareholder meeting (9:00AM PT, Virtual)The frenzy of events will come to a close on June 26 when Nvidia holds its annual shareholder meeting, another chance for investors to get important updates on the company. The meeting will be held virtually at 9:00AM PT.\n\nConference season mostly wraps up ahead of summer break in July and August. After their shareholder meeting, the next time we are likely to hear an update from Nvidia is on their fiscal second-quarter 2025 earnings call on Aug. 21 (projected date).\n\n1 OpenAI gave Jensen Huang a shout-out at the GPT-4o launch in a nod to Nvidia's huge influence on AI, Business Insider, May 14, 2024, https://www.businessinsider.com2 Google I/O Highlights: Unpacking Gemini Updates and AI Overviews, CNET, May 15, 2024, https://www.cnet.com3 Microsoft and NVIDIA Announce Major Integrations to Accelerate Generative AI for Enterprises Everywhere, March 18, 2024, https://nvidianews.nvidia.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "Markets Await NVIDIA Earnings; TGT, WSM Report for Q1",
        "content": "Wednesday, May 22nd, 2024\r\n\r\nPre-market futures are slightly into the red at this hour. Although we’ve seen nice gains on all major indices month-to-date — the Dow +5%, S&P 500 +5.3%, the small-cap Russell 2000 +5.7% and the Nasdaq +7% — we look to have flattened off somewhat over the past week. The Nasdaq and S&P appear to be separating slightly high than the others from a week ago, but those big market up-days look to have cooled off of late.\r\n\r\nIt’s unlikely we’ll see a big market impact before today’s close. True, the Fed minutes from the most recent FOMC meeting on May 1st will be released today at 2pm, but based simply on the fact that the Fed has kept the funds rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50% for the past 10 months (and counting), we don’t anticipate seeing a vastly wide range of opinion in the minutes. The Fed is not expected to bring us another “dot plot” schedule for possible interest rate cuts until the June meeting (19th-20th).\r\n\r\nOne thing we saw from this meeting was a measured decline in security holdings. These will move from -$60 billion per month to -$25 billion per month starting in June. This process has taken down the Fed’s balance sheet from $8.95 trillion two years ago to $7.30 trillion today. (This is still $3.2 trillion higher than pre-Covid levels.) Mortgage-backed securities being allowed to roll off the balance sheet remain at -$35 billion per month.\r\n\r\nAfter today’s open, we’ll also see Existing Home Sales numbers for April. Expectations are for a slight upward moderation to 4.21 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units from 4.19 million posted in March. This number was something of a disappointment for the housing market, however, as February’s strong 4.38 million units looked to bring us out of a year-long doldrums period. However, continued high mortgage rates are keeping a damper on this market until rates start coming down.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA posts earnings after today’s close. It is not only the most highly anticipated earnings report of the week, it is one of the most closely watched (and traded-on) reports of the entire earnings season each quarter, coming as it does so conspicuously late in the reporting cycle. You’ve likely already heard of the massive earnings ands sales gains the company is expected to deliver (+400% earnings, +230% revenues), which goes a long way toward explaining the company’s still-high valuation even after the share price has risen +200% over the past year. But the proof is in the pudding, as they say: we will pay close attention to the results this afternoon.\r\n\r\nTarget TGT posted a slight miss on Q1 earnings this morning. Earnings of $2.03 per share was 2 cents below consensus (which was the identical print, $2.05 per share, in the year-ago quarter) while revenues were just in-line with expectations to $24.53 billion. The company cited a familiar theme among retailers of late: a reticence for high consumer spending on food and home essentials.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe’ve seen price pullbacks in places like Walmart WMT and Costco COST, which looks to tighten prospects for Target going forward. Shares have given up total year-to-date gains at this hour, -9% in the pre-market. For more on TGT’s earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nWilliams-Sonoma WSM, meanwhile, blew away Q1 earnings estimates. Earnings of $4.07 per share spun circles around the $2.78 Zacks consensus, whereas revenues came in-line with estimates at $1.66 billion. Same-store sales slipped -4.9% in the quarter (see the note on consumer spending in the Target paragraph above), but these were anticipated down -6.2%.\n\nFull-year guidance was affirmed for the parent of Pottery Barn, West Elm, etc., and the company is now on a six-quarter positive earnings surprise streak. Shares are up +8% on the news, adding to the eye-opening +54% year to date.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "Finding bargain stocks to buy today isn’t easy. Big-name mega-caps like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remain objectively overvalued yet keep climbing, creating a FOMO factor for investors keen on capturing big tech momentum and upside. Unfortunately, the music may soon stop — leaving legions of bagholders wondering where they went wrong.\n\nBut bargain stocks exist. You’ll just need to dig a bit to find them. Two of these bargain stocks have unstoppable strength and unlimited upside ahead. The third is a stalwart performer who nevertheless keeps beating wider economic malaise post win after win. These bargain stocks may be your best bet to diversify away from overvalued mega-caps while capturing emerging trends that may prove to be the next big thing capturing Wall Street’s attention.\n\nAST SpaceMobile Inc (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS) started the week off strong. After months (or years) of ups and downs, the space-based telecommunications company finally announced what may be the final step toward proper commercialization: a revenue-sharing agreement with AT&T (NYSE:T) to cover gaps in the legacy provider’s global cell coverage with AST’s low-earth satellites. On top of that, the company finally broke free from its “pre-revenue” shackles, posting $500,000 in sales from a government contract leveraging its BlueWalker-3 satellites.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares surged to their highest level since December 2023 on the news, though still trading well below pandemic-era highs. Worse yet, excited investors saw much of the rapid gains dissipate as market forces realized that, though the AT&T deal is monumental, there’s still a long row to hoe before full-blown commercialization efforts bear fruit. Still, shares settled 80% higher than last week, setting this bargain stock to buy up for another leg higher if it can retain momentum. Patient investors should recognize today’s valuation as cheap — from a forward-looking perspective if not absolute value — and consider this space stock one worth buying ASAP.\n\nSharkninja (SN) a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and more\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Digital Genetics\n\nSharkninja (NYSE:SN) stock can’t stop winning, posting a massive 25% return over the past month, contributing to its overall 187% gain since first listing publicly last summer. Despite its per-share pricing strength, the stock remains a bargain — but investors seem to generally ignore the appliance and consumer goods stock’s ultimate strength.\n\nMuch of the recent bullish action surrounding Sharkninja stock came from a strong earnings report that remained resilient despite economic turbulence, which is particularly notable considering even retail giants like Target (NYSE:TGT) are rapidly realigning themselves to adapt to continued inflation and reduced consumer sentiment. Sharkninja sales climbed nearly 25% over the past quarter, while net income increased 24.8% year-over-year. Likewise, the company’s forward-looking statements remain strong and include up to a 20% yearly earnings increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome readers may remember that Sharkninja has posted a 20% annual sales increase yearly since 2008, so its current strength aligns with past trends. Still, the stock is generally under-appreciated and a bargain considering its multiple expansion plans and clear executive ability to steer the ship in the right direction.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT) Cloud graphic with wires coming out of it symbolizing cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT) can’t catch a break. Though each successive earnings report marks major improvements, the bargain stock remains criminally undervalued, trading at just 12x earnings. Likewise, per-share pricing can’t seem to break through out of the roughly $35 range it’s traded at since January.\n\nGigaCloud’s first-quarter earnings include nearly 100% year-over-year sales increases alongside a 71% net income expansion. The B2B product sourcing company expects further upside ahead, noting that recent capital expenditures reduced its bottom line but that “these investments will better position GigaCloud to meet surging Marketplace buyer and seller demands while further enhancing efficiency.”\n\nGigaCloud recently unveiled a sweeping initiative within furniture seller markets, rolling out a branding-as-a-service campaign to let business owners white label existing furniture manufacturing to establish their own sales stream and break into the tricky wider furniture market. Plans like these show that GigaCloud is adept at identifying new market opportunities and bodes well for the bargain stock moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Rival computer chip makers are racing to catch up but Nvidia still holds a leading edge in powering the artificial intelligence boom as it prepares to release its latest financial results Wednesday.\n\nDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as increasingly lifelike personal assistants has fueled astronomical sales of Nvidia's specialized AI chips over the past year.\n\nTech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all signaled they will need to spend more in coming months on the chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.\n\nMany of them are relying on Nvidia's chips, though some are working on lessening that reliance by developing their own. But the investment by the large AI players has largely benefited Nvidia and other chip makers.\n\nThe company, based in Santa Clara, California, carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because founder and CEO Jensen Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. It also makes chips for gaming and cars.\n\nNvidia will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Wednesday. The company's stock has grown into the third largest on Wall Street, making it one of the most influential stocks in the market.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday ahead of an earnings report set to be released on Wednesday. The company's stock surged around 20% over the past month, while adding 98% year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts expect the Santa Clara, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $5.59 per share, up sharply from 98 cents per share in the year-ago period. NVIDIA is projected to post quarterly revenue of $24.65 billion, compared to $6.52 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nSeveral analysts raised their price targets on Nvidia prior to the release of quarterly results. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra maintained NVIDIA with an Outperform, while raising the price target from $1,050 to $1,200. Stifel analyst Ruben Roy boosted the price target from $910 to $1,085, while Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland increased the price target from $1,050 to $1,100. Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis also raised the price target on the stock from $850 to $1,100.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Nvidia, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Nvidia has a dividend yield of 0.02%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 4 cents a share (16 cents a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Nvidia, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Nvidia's $0.16 dividend: $6,000 / $0.16  = 37,500 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $35,769,750 worth of Nvidia, or 37,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.16 = 7,500 shares, or $7,153,950 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nView more earnings on NVDA\n\nAlso Read: Top 5 Health Care Stocks Which Could Rescue Your Portfolio This Month\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 0.6% to close at $953.86 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More: Jim Cramer Calls This Healthcare Stock A ‘Worthy Spec,’ Recommends Avoiding Canada Goose\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The Nvidia Rivals: 3 AI Stocks Ready to Steal the Spotlight",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) is increasingly emerging as a pivotal force shaping the future of technology. As a key player in the AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been leading the list of AI stocks to buy. The tech giant is renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets. Wall Street also focuses on its system-on-a-chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets.\n\nThis week, the spotlight is on the NVDA stock as it is reporting earnings. Nvidia’s stock has been a focal point among investors, due to its remarkable performance over the few past years, but especially since 2023. NVDA’s success can be traced back to its strategic focus on some of the most transformative technologies, including AI, deep learning and autonomous vehicles. Powering breakthroughs in machine learning and data science, its GPUs have become indispensable.\n\nHowever, the AI stocks to buy extend beyond Nvidia. The market is expansive and growing, with many companies vying for a share of the lucrative pie. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI market size stood at $196.6 billion in 2023. In addition, it could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. This growth should be propelled by increasing data volume and the adoption of cloud-based applications and services. There has also been a surge in demand for intelligent virtual assistants.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs the AI industry continues to burgeon, several other companies are making their presence felt and are ready to challenge Nvidia. These companies are not just competitors. They are also potential game-changers, ready to steal the spotlight with their innovative AI solutions. In this article, we will explore three such AI stocks to buy.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the AI stocks to buy, Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) could appeal to long-term investors. The software company specializes in big data analytics for government agencies and commercial clients. Their “Foundry” platform integrates and analyzes large, complex datasets, making PLTR a top contender among AI stocks to buy.\n\nInvestors have been eyeing Palantir for its potential to capitalize on AI, used in everything from fraud detection to national security. The AI play released the financial metrics for the first quarter 2024 at the beginning of May. Revenue grew 21% year-over-year (YOY) to $634 million, driven by strong performance in its U.S. commercial business, which saw a 40% increase. Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) was 8 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a move to empower businesses and governments globally, tech giants Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Palantir are working together. By combining Oracle’s robust cloud infrastructure with Palantir’s cutting-edge AI and data analysis tools, the partnership aims to unlock the full potential of data for organizations. This could translate to improved efficiency, meeting data sovereignty needs and gaining a competitive edge.\n\nAs a result, PLTR stock is up 28% year-to-date (YTD). The company’s profitability metrics are impressive. However, its valuation metrics indicate high expectations, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 171x and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 21x. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for PLTR is $22.00, presenting an upside potential of 3.6% from current levels. Therefore, interested readers may wait for a potential decline toward the $20 level before loading up on PLTR stock.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe next company on our list of AI stocks to buy is SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). The company focuses on the voice AI segment, having made significant strides in enhancing conversational experiences. Its conversational interfaces include automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding and voice-enabled commerce solutions.\n\nOn May 9, SoundHound released first quarter 2024 financial metrics. Revenues grew 73% YOY to $11.6 million, but the adjusted loss per share was 7 cents. The company raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $65 million and $77 million, anticipating continued growth. SoundHound’s management remains optimistic about achieving a revenue milestone of $100 million and reaching adjusted EBITDA profitability by 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, SoundHound AI has strategically partnered with Nvidia and Perplexity to enhance and expand its voice AI capabilities. These partnerships aim to integrate SoundHound’s conversational AI technologies with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle applications and incorporate Perplexity’s large language models to improve the accuracy of SoundHound’s AI solutions. Investors are hopeful that the collaborations could drive innovation and monetization, significantly impacting SoundHound’s market presence and technological advancement.\n\nSo far in the year, SOUN stock has returned 146% YTD, showcasing a strong positive market sentiment towards its future prospects. However, valuation remains expensive as SOUN shares are changing hands at 25.5 times sales. Yet Wall Street’s median price forecast stands at $7.00, suggesting an upside potential of over 36%.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion of AI stocks to buy with Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER). The company is one of the most important names in testing equipment for semiconductors, wireless products and industrial automation solutions.\n\nTeradyne’s management released first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings in late April. Investors noted the continued weakness in mobility. Yet robust memory and networking demand driven by AI applications drove financial performance above the high end of guidance. Going forward, further growth in the semiconductor industry is expected to gain traction, benefiting Teradyne as a provider of testing equipment.\n\nIn 2024, management is anticipating a 500% increase in the high-bandwidth memory test market. The growth will likely be driven by AI tailwinds for semiconductor testing. Analysts note that the increasing complexity of semiconductor testing should continue to drive Teradyne’s margin expansion and profit growth in the long term as well.\n\nAs a result, since January, TER stock has advanced 33.8%. Shares are changing hands at a forward P/E ratio of 44x and a trailing sales ratio of 7.5x. We would wait for a pullback and look to buy Terradyne stock around $130.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil has both long and short positions in NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about the importance of The Dow Jones Industrial Average touching the 40,000 mark for the first time ever. Cramer said that the Dow hitting its new highs was a \"team effort\" with stocks from many different sectors adding to the index's gains, instead of just the gains from major tech stocks with size and growth similar to the likes of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nCramer said that many of the Dow stocks should have been \"hurt\" by the consistent rate hikes by the Fed.\n\n\"They should have been crushed by the inflationary spiral. They should have been annihilated by supply chain problems during COVID. None of that happened.\"\n\nCramer Doesn't See \"Anything\" Like 2008 Crisis Happening\n\nCramer said that it's been almost 20 years since the 2008 financial crisis. Cramer said when he \"surveys\" today's market \"landscape\" he sees the situation totally different from what it was back then.\n\n\"I just don’t see anything like that happening.\"\n\nCramer said that many people would argue that no one saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, but in fact there were many who were warning about the impending collapse, including him.\n\nJim Cramer said that back in 2007 he was \"screaming\" about the \"danger.\"\n\nCramer Laments Over Negativity in the Market\n\nCramer lamented that younger investors from millennials and Generation Z have grown to be pessimists when it comes to the stock market. He wondered whether its his \"job\" to celebrate the Dow hitting 40,000 to infuse some positivity in the market. Cramer said his generation (the Baby Boomers) believed that they were better off when compared to their previous generation financially and had a positive attitude in the stock market.\n\nJim Cramer wondered what's wrong with celebrating when stocks go high.\n\n\"We have so much negativity that surrounds us. We are drowning in it. All of a sudden something positive falls into our lap, a major milestone… does it make sense to scoff at it?\" Cramer said.\n\n\"I'm Not Asking for Champagnes or Trophies\"\n\nThe CNBC host said he's not asking for \"champagnes\" or \"trophies\" to celebrate the Dow's new milestone. What Cramer wants is the rejection of \"nihilism\" and skepticism that's prevailing in the market.

There are no changes to our original guidance as it relates to the following aspects: total system shop openings remain in the range of 150 to 165, same shop sales growth remain in low single digits, capital expenditures are estimated to remain in the range of $280 million to $320 million.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ:SFM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 30\n\nJim Cramer is highly bullish on Arizona-based supermarket chain company Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ:SFM).

We plan to open approximately 35 new stores, all in our current prototype. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes are expected to be between $415 million and $425 million and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $3.05 and $3.13 assuming no additional share repurchases.\n\nThat said, we do expect to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically. We also expect our corporate tax rate to be approximately 25%. During the year, we expect capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursements to be between $225 million and $245 million. To add a bit more color to the full-year, we expect gross margins to be up as we continue to focus on initiatives to improve shrink and annualize our promotional optimization work from 2023.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co (NYSE:ANF)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nOhio-based lifestyle retail Abercrombie & Fitch Co (NYSE:ANF) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending these days.

        "title": "Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Sold Nvidia and Bought This Undervalued ETF Instead",
        "content": "Stan Druckenmiller made a lot of money investing in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), but he's finally taken some of his profits off the table.\n\nThe former hedge fund manager and George Soros lieutenant first invested in Nvidia for his portfolio at his Duquesne Family Office in late 2022. He added a significant amount to his position following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT on Nov. 30 of that year. He continued building up his position almost every quarter in 2023, with the stock and call options representing over 16% of his portfolio as of the end of the year.\n\nAt that point, he'd invested nearly $550 million in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader. That big bet continued to pay off in early 2024 as Nvidia stock climbed higher. But as the share price topped $900, Druckenmiller noted in an interview with CNBC, \"A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now.\"\n\nAs such, he sold some of his shares and all of his call options. He ended the first quarter with just $159 million worth of Nvidia stock, cutting his position by roughly 84%. Druckenmiller's Nvidia stake helped increase his portfolio value by more than $1 billion in the first quarter alone, up from about $3.4 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nBut now, he's onto the next investment. And it's a big one. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nBetting big on small caps\n\nAs of the end of the first quarter, Druckenmiller's biggest position was call options on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF(NYSEMKT: IWM). He held about $664 million worth of options as of the end of March.\n\nThe iShares Russell 2000 ETF is a simple index fund that tracks the Russell 2000, which consists of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. It's the most commonly used index to track small-cap stocks.\n\nSmall-cap stocks have lagged behind their larger peers. As megacaps like Nvidia and the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" fueled overall stock market returns over the past year and a half, small caps have, for the most part, languished.\n\nThe Russell 2000 has yet to surpass the all-time high it reached back in 2021. It's still 14% below that level. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 zoomed past its previous high in January and has continued climbing higher this year.\n\nThere are good reasons why small caps have lagged the overall market.\n\nFirst and foremost, smaller companies are more sensitive to interest rates than larger enterprises. Companies in the Russell 2000 hold a total of $832 billion of debt, 75% of which needs to be refinanced by 2029, according to a report from Bloomberg. By comparison, just 50% of debt obligations from companies in the S&P 500 are due by then.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmaller businesses are also more likely to take on floating-rate debt instead of issuing fixed-rate bonds. As a result, small companies have been beaten down in this high interest rate environment.\n\nAdditionally, small-cap stocks are more sensitive to economic downturns. It's easier for a large company to survive a recession than a small one. And as recession fears increased in 2022 and 2023, small-cap stocks felt the pain.\n\nBut we appear to be turning a corner on both fronts. The Federal Reserve expects to start cutting interest rates later this year. Meanwhile, hopes of a soft landing -- i.e., avoiding a recession -- are increasing. That could be welcome news for small-cap investors, and Druckenmiller now counts himself among them.\n\nThe case for investing in small caps now\n\nDespite their subpar performance over the last few years, small caps historically outperform in the long run. The reason is that smaller companies' stocks demand a greater risk premium because they're more likely to face hardships amid economic downturns or changes in their industry.\n\nAfter a long period of underperformance, the valuation gap between small and large caps is at one of the lowest levels it's seen in decades. The price-to-sales ratio of the Russell 2000 is less than half that of the S&P 500. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the small-cap S&P 600 index (which only tracks profitable businesses) is 30% lower than the S&P 500. These are levels not seen since the early 2000s.\n\nThe last time the gap was this wide, small-cap stocks went on to outperform large-cap stocks for the next few years.\n\nInvestors looking to follow Druckenmiller's lead could invest in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF. However, you may be better off focusing exclusively on small-cap value stocks. Or better yet, profitable small-cap value stocks. Small-cap value has historically been the best-performing segment of the market, while small growth stocks have, as a group, been the worst performing. As such, an index fund like the Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF(NYSEMKT: VIOV) or the actively managed Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF(NYSEMKT: AVUV) could be a better bet.\n\nDruckenmiller thinks the outlook for small caps is good either way. And there are a lot of signals that he's right. Adding a small-cap tilt to your portfolio now seems like a smart idea, and an ETF is the easiest way to do it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Russell 2000 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "When billionaire Ray Dalio left his empire Bridgewater Associates in 2022, the inflation storm and economic uncertainties were pummeling the financial markets. While the fund had started 2022 on a positive note, its returns came crashing down it the last quarter of the year. According to a Bloomberg report, The Pure Alpha fund of Bridgewater fell about 13% in Q4'2022 through November. Bridgewater’s Pure Alpha II fund also fell a whopping 20% in the two months through the end of November 2022. Over the past four years, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund declined by 4%. In 2023, the Pure Alpha fund fell 7.6%, while the hedge fund industry's average return in 2023 through November was 4.35%, with many top hedge funds in the league of Bridgewater (Ken Griffin's Citadel, for example) posting double-digit returns.\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater 2024 Returns So Far\n\nBut what about Ray Dalio's Bridgewater returns in 2024? Ray Dalio gave reins of the fund to a younger management, who had plans to turn things around by cutting costs and restructuring. So far the strategy seems to be working. In April, Bloomberg reported that Bridgewater's flagship Pure Alpha fund has rebounded a whopping 16% this year.\n\nDalio's All Weather Strategy is Under The Weather\n\nBridgewater's All Weather investing strategy developed by Ray Dalio seems to be facing problems in the current market environment, latest reports show.\n\nBut what is this All Weather strategy? Bridgewater explains:\n\n\"I developed a modus operandi to expect surprises. I learned not to let my experiences dominate my thinking; I could go beyond my experiences to see how the machine works.” Ray realized he could understand the economic machine by breaking down economies and markets into their component pieces, and studying the relationships of these pieces through time. This type of thinking is central to All Weather.\"\n\nBut data shows that risk parity funds have trailed traditional 60/40 portfolios since 2019. A Bloomberg report said that pension funds are pulling billions from risk parity funds. One of the biggest reasons why risk parity funds saw losses is rising interest rates. When the Fed started increasing rates, volatility surged past these risk parity funds' acceptable levels and bonds fell to unforeseen levels.\n\nIn this backdrop, we decided to take a look at some technology stocks billionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater was selling in the first quarter of 2024. While the fund sold many tech stocks in the first quarter, overall, its portfolio allocation to tech jumped to 17% as of the end of March from just 7% in the previous quarter. Some top names in the portfolio are NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this article we take a look at 5 stocks Bridgewater sold off completely or reduced its stake in during the March quarter. To see more tech stocks Bridgewater sold off in in 2024, click 4 Tech Stocks Ray Dalio is Selling in 2024.\n\nBILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates sold all 20,844 shares of the financial software company BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) during the first quarter of 2024. Over the past one year BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) shares have gained about 40%. BILL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BILL) recently posted fiscal Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.60, beating estimates by $0.07 per share. Revenue in the quarter jumped 18.5% year over year to $323 million, beating estimates by $16.86 million.\n\nWhile Dalio's fund is selling BILL, it's buying major companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nBridgewater Associates cut its stake in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) by 94% in the first quarter of 2024. The fund still owns 118,397 shares of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) as of the end of March.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nLike HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) was also dumped by Bridgewater in the first quarter, as the fund sold 560,336 shares of the company. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) shares have gained about 23% over the past one year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 50 hedge funds had stakes in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) as of the end of the March quarter.\n\nHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is in the spotlight as analysts expect PC demand to remain upbeat amid an AI-driven refresh cycle. Market data firm Canalys recently said that about 18% of total personal computer shipments globally will be AI-capable PCs, with the firm estimate about 48 million AI-capable PCs to be shipped this year.\n\nHowever, Ray Dalio's hedge fund dumped 77% of its stake in HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nDalio's fund is selling HP but it's holding on to its huge stakes in companies like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nGreenlight Capital mentioned HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“The title of our Sohn presentation was “Solve AI,” which was a play on Solvay’s corporate name. Nonetheless, we established another new long position that actually stands to benefit from AI, which we believe is not reflected in the current stock price. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) sells computers, printers and adjacent products and supplies. We established an initial position at an average price of $30.76 per share, which is about 9x current year earnings estimates. Recent results reflect a two-and-a-half-year cyclical downturn in demand for computers, which followed a mini-boom driven by COVID and related demand for equipment to work-from-home. We believe that we are, at a minimum, on the cusp of a normal PC refresh cycle, which should drive earnings above estimates. HPQ has committed to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. The shares have a 3.6% dividend yield and we estimate HPQ has the capacity to buy back 25-30% of the outstanding shares over the next three years.

Latest reports suggest QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is partnering with semiconductor startup Ampere Computing to develop energy efficient AI chips.\n\nMadison Investments mentioned QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.”\n\nRay Dalio sold many more tech stocks in Q1'2024.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Right Now (and 1 Reason to Sell)",
        "content": "If you want to bet on generative artificial intelligence (AI), there is still no better pick than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company dominates the market for cutting-edge AI data center chips. And unsurprisingly, shares have risen by a whopping 206% over the last 12 months alone. But can the bull run continue? Let's look at three reasons to continue buying Nvidia stock and one reason why it might be time to sell.\n\n1. Spectacular performance\n\nWhile Nvidia's parabolic stock price surge may look like a bubble, it isn't. The rally is justified by equally impressive operational results. Fourth-quarter revenue surged 265% year over year to a record of $22.1 billion, driven by sales of cutting-edge AI hardware. Profitability is also exploding, with net income jumping almost ninefold to $12.3 billion.\n\nNvidia is enjoying a windfall from selling graphics processing units (GPUs) like the h200, which data center clients use to train and run their AI algorithms. This hardware is remarkably expensive, with the h100 costing as much as $30,000 per chip. The strong demand and pricing power allowed Nvidia to boast a software-like gross margin of 76% -- up from 63.3% in the prior-year period.\n\n2. Nvidia can keep the competition at bay\n\nNvidia's astronomical margins are catching the attention of rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, which want to compete for a slice of the AI chip market, and customers like Alphabet or Amazon, aiming to reduce their reliance on third-party hardware by creating in-house custom chips. However, Nvidia is positioned to handle both long-term threats.\n\nNvidia stays ahead of the competition through constant innovation and a faster product update cycle. While rivals are trying to match its current flagship, the h100, Nvidia is already launching its replacement, the h200, which features more memory and faster algorithm training speeds.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company is also tackling the $30 billion custom chip opportunity with a new segment designed to help clients build AI chips specialized for specific use cases. Nvidia's scale and design expertise could help it make custom chips more efficiently than its clients could do themselves.\n\n3. Low valuation\n\nWith spectacular top and bottom-line growth coupled with a deep economic moat, Nvidia sounds like a company that deserves massive premium valuation. However, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 38, shares are only moderately higher than the Nasdaq-100 average of 33. And this looks like a shockingly good deal. So, why exactly is Nvidia stock still so cheap? There is one big risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI market might not meet expectations\n\nWhile there are plenty of reasons for investors to buy Nvidia stock, there is one big reason to be more cautious: The AI market might not live up to expectations. According to the Washington Post, AI chatbots lose money with every customer search because of their high operating costs. And it is still unclear how companies plan to monetize them.\n\nAs the producer of picks and shovels in this \"gold rush,\" Nvidia is currently shielded from the lack of profitability in consumer-facing AI applications. However, if companies keep losing money on AI, they may eventually scale back their spending on Nvidia's hardware. This challenge is likely the most daunting headwind Nvidia faces. But the good news is that its current valuation seems to already price in a possible slowdown.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks continue to be a hot corner of the market. As the technology that enables artificial intelligence applications and models, demand for shares of companies that design and fabricate microchips and semiconductors is growing exponentially.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the worldwide market for chips and semiconductors is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2032, up from $681 billion this year.\n\nGiven the explosive growth, it makes sense for investors to hold some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio. And there are more stocks to consider than just Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While those stocks seem to get all the attention, the chip sector is diverse with plenty of names to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere is the 2030 millionaire’s club: three semiconductor stocks to buy now.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs is typical, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) just delivered strong financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. The microchip-equipment maker, whose components are used by companies like Nvidia and AMD, announced earnings per share of $2.09 for its second fiscal quarter. That was ahead of analysts’ consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 a share.\n\nRevenue in the quarter totaled $6.65 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $6.54 billion. The company also raised its forward guidance. For the current quarter, Applied Materials said it expects $6.65 billion of revenue and $2.19 in EPS.\n\nAnalysts had penciled in for the company sales of $6.59 billion and a profit of $1.98 a share. Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said the company is seeing increased demand for its products from chipmakers as the AI buildout accelerates.\n\nAMAT stock has increased abiyt 74% over the last 12 months and is up about 457% in the past five years.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nTo Europe with ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML). The Dutch microchip company specializes in making photolithography machines that are used to produce computer microchips. Like Applied Materials, ASML’s equipment is in hot demand as the industry works overtime to produce chips to power the AI revolution.\n\nAs a result, ASML stock is up about 29% this year and up about 388% through five years. The company’s stock is one of the best performers among European equities.\n\nThat said, the share price fell briefly in mid-April after the company reported financial results that missed the mark in terms of revenue figures. The downturn didn’t last long and ASML stock quickly recovered. In the last month, the share price has risen 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are finally signs of life at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). After a long-term underperformance, TXN stock is up 22% in the past month after the legacy semiconductor company delivered better-than-expected financial results for this year’s first quarter.\n\nFor Q1, Texas Instruments reported EPS of $1.20. That was ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $1.07 per share. Revenue came in at $3.66 billion, which topped analyst estimates of $3.60 billion.\n\nThe earnings beat has Texas Instruments’ stock marching higher. The company primarily makes microchips and semiconductors for use in the automotive industry and industrial applications.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Texas Instruments forecast Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The outlook aligned with Wall Street forecasts. TXN stock is now up 16% over the past 12 months and has nearly doubled over the last five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AMAT.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings, Fed minutes, UK inflation - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Earnings from tech giant Nvidia are in the spotlight Wednesday, as investors look to see whether the stock's elevated valuation can be justified The minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting also loom large, while U.K. inflation fell by less than was expected in April.\n\n1. Nvidia earnings in spotlight\n\nThe day’s highlight is the long-awaited earnings report from semiconductor bellwether Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the close Wednesday, with these numbers widely seen as a barometer for the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm over all-things AI has helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climb close to its all-time high, up more than 12% this year.\n\nNvidia’s earnings are likely to impact the share prices of AI-related companies - such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) - but will also have an outsized influence over broader markets given it is now the third-biggest U.S. company by market value, trailing only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nRobust earnings from Nvidia could help justify stock market valuations that have grown stretched in recent months.\n\n“We expect NVIDIA to beat and raise in the April quarter, albeit not reaching the levels of the January quarter, due to improved supply and anticipated year-over-year deceleration from tougher comparisons,” said analysts at Rosenblatt, in a note dated May 20.\n\n“We expect volatility into this week’s print but are nonetheless positively biased on a story that is increasingly resonating with the best secular idea in all of technology.”\n\n2. Fed minutes to offer interest rate clues\n\nMinutes from the Federal Open Markets Committee's most recent meeting are due to be released later in the session, and they will be parsed for clues regarding timing and extent of policy-easing this year.\n\nLast week’s cooler-than-expected U.S. CPI release has calmed nerves about the Federal Reserve keeping rates higher for longer, but this release followed the Fed meeting that these minutes represent.\n\nFed officials have continued to warn about inflation risks, creating a degree of uncertainty over when the Fed will start cutting this year, if at all.\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller on Tuesday said recent economic data indicates the Fed's restrictive policy is working as directed, while Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic said the central bank needs to exercise caution ahead of its first rate cut to lead to pent-up spending and send inflation \"bouncing around.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Futures little changed ahead of Fed minutes\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely unchanged Wednesday, amid caution ahead of the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting as well as results from market favorite Nvidia.\n\nBy 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 13 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 2 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 6 points, or 0.1%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices close higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite registering new record-setting closes.\n\nIn the corporate sector, Nvidia’s numbers will be the highlight, and earnings are also due from the likes of Target (NYSE:TGT), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), TJX (NYSE:TJX) and Raymond James (NYSE:RJF).\n\nElsewhere, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) stock rose over 6% after the clothing retailer beat expectations on the top and bottom line in its latest quarter, while homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) gained 1% after raising its full-year delivery guidance.\n\n4. UK inflation falls by less than expected\n\nInflation in Britain fell by less than expected in April, disappointing investors who were looking for the Bank of England to cut interest rates next month and suggesting that global inflationary pressures may prove tricky to tame.\n\nConsumer prices rose by an annual 2.3%, down sharply from a 3.2% increase in March and its lowest since July 2021 when it stood at 2.0%, the Office for National Statistics said. But still above the 2.1% forecast.\n\nServices inflation - a key gauge of domestically generated price pressure for the BoE - was much higher than expected, at 5.9% from 6.0% in March, above the expected reading of 5.5%.\n\nEconomists had widely expected a sharper drop in inflation, citing a 12% drop in regulated household energy tariffs that took effect last month.\n\nAfter Wednesday's inflation figures for April, there will be a set of official labor market data and May's inflation release before the BoE's next scheduled policy announcement on June 20.\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates this summer, but August is more favored as the start of the cutting cycle, rather than June.\n\n5. Crude fell after US inventories build\n\nCrude prices fell Wednesday, retreating for the third straight session on U.S. interest rates jitters as well as an unexpected build in U.S. inventories.\n\nBy 04:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $77.74 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.94 per barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly grew by 2.5 million barrels last week, raising some concerns over sluggish U.S. oil demand, with the upcoming Memorial Day holiday marking the traditional start of the travel-heavy summer season.\n\nOfficial inventory data from the Energy Information Agency are due later in the session.\n\nA string of cautious statements from Federal Reserve officials this week also weighed on sentiment, as markets feared that high-for-longer U.S. rates will eat into demand this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings, Fed minutes, UK inflation - what's moving markets\n\nStocks slip on inflation jitters, offsetting Nvidia hopes\n\nChina will control property sector risk, says vice premier\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amid rampant market hype, many high-profile companies with solid growth rates are seeing strong uptake from investors. But that’s not to say all growth stocks are seeing the same sort of enthusiasm from investors. There are plenty of overlooked growth stocks with robust fundamentals that go unnoticed, presenting lucrative investment prospects across various sectors.\n\nWith a strong bull market appearing to be underway, many investors are looking for the best opportunities to buy into this upside. The thing is, finding companies with the right mix of long-term growth potential and undervaluation (or a relative lack of coverage from Wall Street) is hard to do. The following three companies are ones I’d put in this bucket.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into three growth stocks I think are overlooked and should be considered as long-term buys for investors oriented toward growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom Video (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the pandemic’s ultimate star in the video conferencing space, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) has certainly become a hot name in the sector. The company’s Q4 2023 results highlighted excellent growth despite post-pandemic headwinds, with the company seeing significant profitability growth that’s attracting growth and value investors alike. Now trading at 29-times earnings, ZM stock is widely viewed as a value play. The shift towards enterprise revenue hints at potential accelerated growth.\n\nIndeed, I’m of the view that profitability growth is going to matter more than revenue growth during the next phase of this bull market cycle. Investors want to see real returns on their investment. In this regard, Zoom provides plenty to be excited about.\n\nWe’ll find out more about how Zoom’s top and bottom line growth is proceeding when it reports its Q1 2025 earnings on May 20. The market is expecting to see a $1.125 billion revenue, and earnings per share to come in within the range of $1.18 to $2. Q1 will most likely see some sustained demand for Zoom’s products such as Webinars, Rooms, and Phones. Introducing Compliance Manager and Swoogo’s hybrid events offering will further expand the company’s solutions and attract enterprise customers.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) An image of the Matterport, Inc. (MTTR) logo\n\nSource: Matterport\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is an intriguing potential growth stock for investors to consider. The company recently launched a platform aimed at enterprise clients looking to make their emissions reporting more robust. This platform measures emissions saved through its digital twin platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped with carbon accounting experts, these reports help clients grasp emissions reduced by remote collaboration instead of onsite inspections. As corporations prioritize climate responsibility, they commit to UN Sustainable Development Goals and set science-based targets for emission reduction.\n\nMatterport’s 3D digital twins streamline tasks like tours and inspections, cutting Scope 3 emissions. They reduce costs and boost productivity for businesses with large property portfolios, offering virtual collaboration.\n\nMoreover, its new reporting quantifies the sustainability impact of digital twins, aiding enterprises in making eco-conscious property decisions. A Fortune 100 client praised the concise avoided emissions report for showcasing sustainability benefits. I think as this market grows, Matterport’s market capitalization should as well over time.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) stands out in the software industry with its essential database software and swiftly expanding cloud computing divisions. Embracing artificial intelligence trends, Oracle has experienced rapid growth. In mid-2024, demand for its Gen2 AI infrastructure surpassed supply despite extensive data center expansions. Its leading position in database software and booming AI-driven cloud services attract significant investor attention.\n\nAccording to reports from The Information, Elon Musk’s AI venture, xAI, is engaging in talks with Oracle about a $10 billion cloud contract. Unsurprisingly, Oracle shares surged on the news. Sources revealed that if finalized, xAI could emerge as one of Oracle’s major clients. Established a year ago, xAI aspires to rival OpenAI in extensive language model development for generative AI applications. Oracle’s stock soared over 3% to $119.89, hitting $122 post-news before a minor pullback.\n\nThe deal signals Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s triumph over rivals like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), seen as a boost for Oracle amid rising demand for generative AI. Despite a sales slowdown last year, Oracle’s stock rebounded after a robust February quarter report, with a 49% surge in cloud infrastructure revenue to $1.9 billion. This isn’t the first collaboration between Musk’s startup and Oracle. The companies previously worked together to supply high-powered computing chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to support xAI. Do yourself a favor and grab this and the rest of these overlooked growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Wednesday as investors awaited more cues on U.S. interest rates from the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting.\n\nCooling optimism over China dented sentiment towards regional markets, while investors were also wary of technology stocks before key earnings from market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nWall Street indexes saw a mildly positive session on Tuesday, providing middling cues to Asian markets as a string of Fed officials cautioned that sticky inflation could keep rates high for longer. But the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite still eked out record highs on gains in tech.\n\nU.S. stock futures were rangebound in Asian trade.\n\nJapanese stocks dip after disappointing trade data\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes were the worst performers in Asia on Wednesday, falling 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, following disappointing trade data from the country.\n\nJapan’s exports grew less than expected in April as demand in key markets, particularly China, remained weak, while imports also disappointed as local demand remained subdued.\n\nThis saw the country log a bigger-than-expected trade deficit in the month.\n\nTech stocks skittish ahead of Nvidia earnings\n\nAsian technology stocks did not track overnight gains in their U.S. peers, with tech-heavy regional bourses keeping to a tight range ahead of key earnings from artificial intelligence major Nvidia, due after the U.S. close on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI was flat, while the Taiwan Weighted index rose marginally. Both indexes list some of Nvidia’s biggest Asian suppliers, such as SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM).\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index was an exception, rising 0.6% as it steadied from bruising losses in the prior session.\n\nNvidia is considered as a bellwether for the tech sector, given that the company is at the heart of a massive valuation spike on optimism over the fast-growing AI industry.\n\nThe firm makes the most advanced AI chips currently available in the market, and is expected to clock an exponential increase in earnings on the back of an AI boom over the past year.\n\nAsian shares muted as China optimism cools, Fed minutes loom\n\nBroader Asian markets kept to a tight range. China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite hovered below their 2024 peaks as optimism over more stimulus measures from Beijing appeared to be cooling, with investors now looking to more positive cues from the country to resume buying into local markets.\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 was flat, having curbed a bulk of its intraday gains following somewhat hawkish signals from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which kept rates steady and said it saw delays in any potential cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a flat open, although the index is set to remain in sight of recent record highs.\n\nInvestors were on edge before the minutes of the Fed’s late-April meeting, which are expected to provide more insight into the bank’s stance on interest rates.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks rangebound with Fed minutes, Nvidia earnings in focus\n\nNvidia Asian suppliers cautiously advance as Q1 earnings loom\n\nUS stock futures steady after record highs; Nividia, Fed minutes awaited\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morning Bid: New Zealand, Indonesia set rates; Nvidia vigil almost over",
        "content": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nMonetary policy decisions from New Zealand and Indonesia are the main points of focus in Asia on Wednesday, as debate over the timing of the first U.S. rate cut ebbs and flows, and lofty equity markets consider their next step.\n\nAsian stocks retreated on Tuesday, snapping a seven-day winning streak despite the relative calm in currency and bond markets. But Wall Street crept higher, with the Nasdaq reaching a new peak ahead of Nvidia's first-quarter earnings report.\n\nThe message on interest rates from a raft of Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday was patience. Indeed, it may be several months before policymakers are confident inflation is really falling back to target, allowing them to start cutting rates.\n\nWith many stock markets around the world at record or multi-year highs, a period of cooling may be inevitable. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index on Tuesday slipped 0.9% - its biggest fall in over a month - while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.3%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed more than 2%.\n\nAfter Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson rowed back on his long-standing gloomy outlook for Wall Street on Monday, another prominent bear, JP Morgan's Marko Kolanovic, reiterated his view that U.S. stocks are too expensive and should head south.\n\nHe is much more upbeat on Asia, favoring Japanese and Chinese equities over U.S. markets. Japan is attractive because of inflation and monetary policy normalization, while measures to support the housing market, underweight investor positioning and cheap valuations are reasons to buy China.\n\nWhile the world maintains its vigil ahead of AI darling Nvidia's results on Wednesday, investors in Asia digest two monetary policy decisions and other potentially exchange rate-moving data, including Japanese trade and South Korean producer price inflation.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Bank Indonesia are both expected to leave their key interest rates on hold, at 5.50% and 6.25%, respectively, according to Reuters polls.\n\nThe RBNZ is only expected to cut its cash rate once this year, and probably not until the final quarter. Money markets are a bit more dovish, and are currently pricing in 45 basis points of easing by year-end.\n\nAfter stunning markets last month with an unexpected rate hike to support the rupiah, Bank Indonesia (BI) is expected to keep its seven-day reverse repurchase rate at 6.25% and hold it there for several months, or until the Fed cuts U.S. rates.\n\nIn a rare media briefing earlier this month, BI Governor Perry Warjiyo said current data shows there is no need to raise rates again, and the central bank is trying to strengthen the rupiah beyond 16,000 per dollar.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rupiah closed trading on Tuesday at 15,990 per dollar.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:\n\n- New Zealand monetary policy decision\n\n- Indonesia monetary policy decision\n\n- Japan trade (April)\n\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Tuesday after persistent strength in technology stocks, ahead of key earnings from market darling Nvidia, saw Wall Street just about clock new highs.\n\nBut investors remained on edge before more cues on interest rates, chiefly from the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s late-April meeting, which were due on Wednesday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,346.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose slightly to 18,811.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures inched higher to 40,016.00 points.\n\nFed minutes awaited as officials stick to cautious stance on rates\n\nThe Fed minutes are due during Wednesday’s session, and come following a string of cautious signals from members of the central bank.\n\nThe Fed kept rates steady during the meeting and warned that inflation was turning sticky. But it had also still mentioned the possibility of interest rate cuts this year, a statement that markets had clung to.\n\nStill, several Fed officials cautioned this week that the central bank needed much more confidence that inflation was easing, before it could begin trimming rates. But they also downplayed speculation that the bank would increase rates further.\n\nBeyond the minutes, more Fed officials are also set to speak in the coming days. The central bank is now expected to potentially begin cutting rates in September.\n\nNasdaq, S&P hit record highs ahead of Nvidia earnings\n\nWall Street indexes eked out some gains on Tuesday, boosted chiefly by the technology sector as investors positioned for hotly anticipated earnings from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe chipmaker is widely considered as a bellwether for the rapidly-growing artificial intelligence industry, and is expected to clock exponential growth in earnings on the back of demand from the industry.\n\nNvidia currently makes the most advanced AI chips available in the market, and is expected to have benefited substantially from major tech companies racing to further their AI plans.\n\nAnticipation of Nvidia's earnings saw investors buy further into technology stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3% to a record-high close of 5,321.41 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.2% to a record-high 16,832.62 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 39,872.99 points.\n\nNvidia, which also shot up to become the third-most valuable company on Wall Street, hovered just below a record high in aftermarket trade.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after record highs; Nividia, Fed minutes awaited\n\nSingapore Airlines flight hits severe turbulence, one passenger dead, dozens injured\n\nCalifornia court weighs fate of law treating app-based drivers as contractors\n\nView comments",

        "content": "U.S. equities appear to be back on the rise in May. After suffering significant losses in the month of April, both the S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have more than recovered. In fact, the Nasdaq has risen 11.24% as of the end of Friday’s trading session. Leading the rise of U.S.-listed stocks has largely been technology companies. Everything from the rise of cloud computing to advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have boosted share prices.\n\nTech giants, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google have become trillion-dollar companies in terms of their stock market capitalization. Over the next decade, several mega-cap tech stocks are well on their way to reaching $1 trillion. Below are three of them.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which boasts an $84 billion market cap, has become a dominant force within the cloud-based cybersecurity space. Embedding artificial intelligence technology into its vulnerability management (VM) tools has only increased the value of its products. CrowdStrike’s Falcon end-point security platform had its debut way back in 2013 and always employed machine learning techniques to identify threats across an enterprise’s technology apparatus. The release of advanced AI models has allowed the platform to be a one-stop solution for end-point security.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloud-based cybersecurity has increased in demand over the past decade. The rise of cloud computing technology placed tons of enterprise data and applications on cloud servers. In a multitude of manners, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand for cloud products, as many businesses went remote and adopted online tools powered by cloud technology. With companies storing much of their data in distant servers versus on their own premises, cybersecurity has become increasingly important.\n\nNot to mention, the cybersecurity space is succumbing to increased consolidation. A lot of these smaller cybersecurity players have lost out to other larger players, including CrowdStrike. For evidence, one just needs to observe the robust double-digit growth rates of CrowdStrike’s sales figures versus the plummeting rates of similar VM platforms like Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), or Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).\n\nCrowdStrike shares have risen 35.5% on a year-to-date-basis and could very well continue their rise as the platform dominates its respective space.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a key semiconductor computer processor giant. Consumer technology enthusiasts know AMD for their competitively priced and quality central porcessing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The chipmaker was able knock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) off its feet due to adopting a fabless model of producing silicon chips. That is, rather than being bogged down on the manufacturing side of chipmaking like Intel, AMD outsourced that to the very capable Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). It effectively allows it to focus on chip design and efficiency.\n\nAMD next momentous rise will be in the space of AI chips. The semiconductor firm announced an array of new GPUs that would empower the creation of large language models (LLMs) in June 2023 and followed that up with subsequent releases in December. Of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI chip space currently but as AMD enters the market and acquires market share, not only will AMD increase sales and net income growth, but its market capitalization could skyrocket.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing makes the final entry on this list. This Taiwan-based contract chip manufacturer has a market capitalization of $672 billion and is poised to rise even further. The chip manufacturer dominates in terms of manufacturing capabilities and capacity. To make silicon chips more efficient from generation to generation, it’s always been about fitting more transistors on a smaller node size. TSM has been able to successfully manufacture chips at a 3-nanometer node size. It is the most advanced in the industry at this point.\n\nBecause of TSM’s prowess, companies like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD have leveraged its capabilities to construct their advanced chips. What will make TSM a $1 trillion company is the demand for AI chips. In their first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, TSM handily beat both revenue and earnings estimates. The reason was the sizable demand for advanced AI chips that has been all the craze over the past 12 months.\n\nRiding off of this demand and its successful manufacturing competencies, TSM is probably the most likely on this list to become the next Apple, Amazon or Google in terms of market cap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is set report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday in what will be one of the most consequential reports for investors this year.\n\nWall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue and profits that rose more than 200% and 400%, respectively, from the prior year period as the company experiences a surge in demand for its chips amid the AI boom.\n\nAnalysts expect adjusted earnings per share to total $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nNvidia stock has been on a tear over the last year, rising over 200%. The stock has risen nearly 700% since the stock market lows in October 2022.\n\nThe vast majority of Nvidia's revenue will come from its Data Center business, which is set to pull in $21 billion, up from $4.28 billion in Q1 last year.\n\nThe company’s Gaming division, formerly its largest segment, is expected to see revenue of $3.5 billion, up from $2.24 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia’s earnings announcement, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on the company’s share price to $1,085 from $910, saying that he anticipates Nvidia will once again beat expectations on the top and bottom line and raise its guidance for the next quarter.\n\nDemand for its chips from hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and others has boosted the company's results, making Wednesday's report a key check on the industry's appetite for further AI investment.\n\nAnd as Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, the AI trade has moved beyond the borders of tech, with investors looking to energy and power companies as derivative plays on the AI boom.\n\nBut Roy, like analysts at BofA Global Research and Loop Capital, says there remain near-term concerns about how much the transition from Nvidia’s current Hopper line of AI chips to its Blackwell line will impact overall sales.\n\nThe fear is that customers will put some of their orders for Hopper chips on hold while they wait for Nvidia to roll out its more powerful Blackwell products. The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Amazon had paused some orders from Nvidia as it waits for more advanced Blackwell chips to be made available.\n\nLoop Capital’s Ananda Baruah argued it's possible Nvidia won't let companies put their Hopper orders on hold without losing their place in line to purchase Blackwell chips. If enough customers put their orders on hold in favor of Blackwell chips, Nvidia could see a temporary dip in quarter-over-quarter sales.\n\nStory continues NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang displays products on-stage during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia is also contending with the threat of its customers building their own in-house AI chips.\n\nSo far Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are using — or are working toward — their own AI chips that provide better power efficiency than Nvidia’s offerings.\n\nThat doesn’t mean those companies will completely abandon Nvidia’s chips, though the push to their own products could cut into the chip giant’s market share. AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are gaining steam when it comes to their own AI chips.\n\nOn Tuesday, for instance, Microsoft announced it will begin offering AMD’s MI300X chips for developers looking to train and deploy AI models during its Build conference. The Windows maker also made sure, however, to point out that it is using Nvidia’s chips as well. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

(NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings report.\n\nTuesday saw Federal Reserve officials making public statements with mixed messages.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expects inflation to decline but at a slow pace, and he does not foresee a rate cut before the fourth quarter.\n\nBoard member Christopher J. Waller, on a more dovish note, said the risk of inflation reaccelerating is off the table and he does not expect a rate hike.\n\nSectors and industries were little moved, with financials and solar stocks slightly outperforming.\n\nSmall caps softened, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) falling 0.3%. Treasury yields inched lower, with the benchmark 10-year yield dropping 4 basis points to 4.41%, on track to snap a three-straight session of yield gains.\n\nMetal commodities paused for a breather, after both gold and copper hit fresh record highs on Monday. Crude oil fell 1.6%.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell 2.2% to $69,900, reflecting some waning investor sentiment toward risky assets.\n\nTuesday’s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Nasdaq 100 18,697.36 0.1% S&P 500 5,313.73 0.1% Dow Jones 39,835.34 0.1% Russell 2000 2,098.09 -0.2%\n\nUpdated at 13:14 EDT\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was flat at $530.15, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) was flat at $398.18 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was also unchanged at $454.93, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the FinancialSelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) outperformed, up by 0.3%.

        "content": "Even though inflation has been high for a long time, the allure of high-potential tech stocks persists.\n\nIn May, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve Board didn’t bring rates down from a record high of 5.25% to 5.5%. However, the markets are eagerly anticipating the June meeting.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) says stocks are too expensive and buyers may have too high of hopes for business results. Because of this, 2024 is expected to be a more even year with growth rates lower than 10 percent. J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) expects the real GDP to grow by 0.7% in 2024 because when the pandemic ended, monetary policy became stricter and economic tailwinds stopped.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this case, we’ll look at three tech companies with big prospects that have buy rates and double-digit upsides. The first is a strong rival in the artificial intelligence (AI) market thanks to its cutting-edge AI chipsets, which have helped it grow 20% this year. Another company is changing its financial plan to buy back a lot of its own shares and pay bonuses. Finally, a third company offers simple mobile apps and smart AI to take advantage of the growing game industry and better internet access in developing countries. Let’s delve in.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is up 20% this year due to its AI chipsets. But analysts still rate it a strong buy, with a 15% upside potential.\n\nAs businesses search for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) substitutes, AMD is poised to seize a sizable portion of the market with the launch of its MI300X GPU chipset. Nvidia controls the market for AI chips, with an 80% market share. Yet, AMD is emerging as a worthy contender.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD dominates high-performance computing. It powers 156 new Top500 supercomputers, up 29% from last year. Many high-end supercomputers employ AMD Instinct MI300A APUs.\n\nMoreover, AMD’s Alveo V80 is coming down the pike. Those include next-generation firewalls and network security, genome sequencing, molecular dynamics, and other computationally demanding applications.​\n\nAMD’s first-quarter revenue was $5.47 billion, up 2.2%. And its profitability was $123 million after losing $139 million in Q1 2023. The company’s $0.62 EPS exceeded $0.61. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.13 billion, 21% more than GAAP $36 million.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices expects Q2 sales of $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, up 6% year-over-year (YOY) and 4% sequentially.\n\nIn recognition of its innovation, AMD received the IEEE 2024 Corporate Innovation Award for its chipset design leadership in high-performance and flexible computing, placing it well among high-potential tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) The logo for T-Mobile is displayed on a sign for an indoor retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nT-Mobile’s (NASDAQ:TMUS) 1.59% dividend yield is below the industry average. Yet, it’s part of a substantial share repurchase and financial flexibility strategy.​\n\nThe company repurchased 21.9 million shares for $3.6 billion in Q1 of 2024. As of March 31, the business repurchased 136.2 million shares for $19.8 billion. Also, it can use an additional $11.7 billion for buybacks. Meanwhile, the annual dividend is $2.60 per share, yielding about 1.59%.\n\nT-Mobile predicts postpaid net customer additions of 5.2 million to 5.6 million in 2024, up from 5.0 million to 5.5 million. And $31.4–$31.9 billion Core Adjusted EBITDA is expected.\n\nAdditionally, TMUS has officially finalized the $1.35 billion deal to buy Ka’ena Corporation, which owns Mint and Ultra Mobile. The purchase would use T-Mobile’s size to improve these companies’ products and services while maintaining their business structures.\n\nRyan Reynolds will continue as a creative executive while Mint Mobile’s owners handle T-Mobile brands. This deal is projected to enhance T-Mobile’s Core Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow later this year.​\n\nOn the product end, T-Mobile is enhancing its mid-band 5G network. The expansion moves 95% of T-Mobile’s 5G traffic to mid-band, assuring reliability and speed.\n\nOpera (OPRA) An image of hands controlling a game on a cellphone, a charger and mug in the background\n\nSource: Ayunannas/Shutterstock\n\nOpera (NASDAQ:OPRA) is one of the best high-potential tech stocks because it operates one of the preferred browsers for the gaming community, Opera GX. Although it is difficult to get a firm estimate of the gaming segment, one projection indicates that in 2024, there will be 3.32 billion active video gamers worldwide. Opera is leveraging this growth.\n\nIn addition, Opera’s lightweight mobile browsers are popular in South Asia, Africa and Latin America with underpowered devices. The company should develop significantly as internet coverage rises in these locations. Unsurprisingly, thanks to significant growth potential, analysts rate the stock a strong buy, with a 64% upside.\n\nMost importantly, Opera’s future growth rests on new product developments. To that end, Opera One, a redesigned desktop browser, received the IF DESIGN AWARD 2024. This was due to its new architecture, AI and design. AI Feature Drops, a bi-weekly feature in Opera One, lets users test new AI capabilities.​\n\nAlso, Opera signed an agreement with Google, extending its search agreement with Google. This ensures the continued integration of Google’s search capabilities within its products​.\n\nIn addition, OPRA revealed experimental support for 150 local Large Language Model (LLM) versions in its browser. So, this makes it the first major browser with local AI model access, and a quality pick among high-potential tech stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

This adjustment triggered a notable price reaction, with the stock declining by 16.90%. DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) operates in the technology sector and faced this substantial reduction in its price target, indicative of potential challenges ahead. Despite the downgrade in price target, Bachman maintained his Market Perform rating, suggesting a neutral outlook on the stock's performance relative to the market.\n\nIn a recent development, DXC Technology Company (NYSE:DXC) has unveiled a new collaboration with Dell Technologies aimed at advancing Enterprise Intelligence Services (EIS).

(NYSE:GLOB) by lowering their price targets. For a comprehensive overview of Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) and other stocks affected by such adjustments, see Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks .\n\nGlobant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -9.98(-5.62%)\n\nOn May 17, Needham maintained its buy rating on Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) while revising down its price target from $275 to $200. This adjustment, which led to a price reaction of -5.62%, came on the heels of Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) first-quarter financial results for 2024. Despite reporting revenue that exceeded expectations and meeting forecasts for earnings per share, the technology industry player experienced a significant reduction in its price target. Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) impressive performance in the first quarter included a 20.9% year-over-year revenue growth, with organic constant currency growth reaching 12.7%. Notable achievements during this period included securing a lucrative contract with a major global airline, forging a partnership with Formula 1, and acquiring seven new clients, each contributing over $1 million in revenue.\n\nHowever, despite these successes, Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) provided a slightly conservative outlook for the second quarter and revised its full-year guidance downward, citing increased foreign exchange pressures as the primary reason. It's worth noting that this adjustment in the annual forecast does not reflect a change in the company's organic growth projections, which still anticipate a 10% year-over-year increase. This growth trajectory stands in stark contrast to the flat trends projected by Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) competitors for fiscal year 2024. Needham emphasized that, based on an ex-cash forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of approximately 21 times for fiscal year 2025, the current valuation offers an attractive risk-reward proposition for investors. Despite the adjustment in the price target in response to the updated company guidance and prevailing market conditions, Needham reiterated its positive stance on the stock.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Finally, we added to our existing position in Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) with the proceeds from trimming back our Accenture position. We think this is prudent because Globant’s valuation isn’t much higher than Accenture’s, but it should be able to grow EPS faster at ~20%+ over the next five years. We see both as excellent businesses benefiting from similar tailwinds behind the increasing need for trusted third party IT services providers and continue to feel good about holding both companies for the long term.”\n\nYou can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are downgraded.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "title": "Future Millionaire’s Alert: 3 Chip Stocks Set to Make You Rich in 10 Years",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) breathed new life into the semiconductor industry. Reminiscent of the early days of the PC wars when chip stocks battled each other for supremacy by outdoing the latest advance by a rival, AI now has spawned new challengers to the old guard. Almost daily, they seem to offer new features and power.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the AI chip stock of choice. But you don’t have to put all your eggs into one basket — or all your chips onto one wafer. There is a rapidly expanding universe of semiconductor stocks to buy that could turn investors into millionaires within the next 10 years.\n\nBelow are three of the best chip stocks available today to make you wealthy tomorrow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdmittedly, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) isn’t a chipmaker per se. It designs chip architectures that come with a set of instructions that semiconductor companies license. However, the chip designer just announced it will produce its first AI chip beginning next year. It won’t manufacture the chip itself but will turn to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and other foundries to ensure it has the capacity necessary to produce the chips. TSM currently produces almost all of Arm’s chips.\n\nArm Holdings has also been expanding into the data center market because its chip’s low power needs make them perfect for the segment’s high energy consumption. The market for AI chips is currently estimated at $30 billion, but within five years, it is expected to exceed $100 billion.\n\nEnergy conservation is also important in running PCs, and Arm’s architecture will be essential for the future AI PCs that will hit the market. Morgan Stanley analysts say Arm-based central processing units (CPUs) will be the standard for future computers. It forecasts AI PCs will achieve penetration rates of 95% by 2027 compared to just 8% today. And Arm CPUs will “launch changes affecting the global semiconductor industry.”\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers will also be the driving force behind Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a chipmaker best-known for its mobile handset chips. However, it recently shifted its focus to data center infrastructure and found its custom accelerators in high demand. AI, of course, was the primary factor behind the uptake, and Broadcom reported that its first-quarter AI revenue surged by 300% to $2.3 billion. AI is now forecast to total $10 billion this year, or 35% of the total.\n\nAccording to industry analysts at Newark, support for AI demand will double the market for data centers by 2030, measured in gigawatts (GW). Data centers will absorb 35 GW by 2030, surpassing the 17 GW total needed in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat will help boost Broadcom stock investors to millionaire status by 2030 is not just the capital appreciation they will enjoy from its stock. They will see their returns juiced by the dividend the chipmaker has increased for 14 consecutive years. It has grown the payout at a 36% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 10 years. The combination of share price growth and dividend payments will make investors fabulously wealthy and could push AVGO’s valuation to $1 trillion or more in the years ahead.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was an early adopter of the AI regime, integrating the technology throughout its products and services. Through its investment in and partnership with OpenAI‘s generative AI chatbot Chat GPT, its Azure cloud computing infrastructure is completely infused with the technology.\n\nNow, Microsoft is offering its cloud customers Advanced Micro Device’s (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips as an alternative to Nvidia chips. It will provide for sale AMD’s MI300X chips, which are more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 chips. While Nvidia has come out with even more advanced semiconductors since, they are more expensive than the alternative that can also meet the AI needs of most customers. Microsoft also sells its own AI chips called Maia and is about to introduce a new processor called Cobalt 100 that reportedly offers 40% better performance than other processors based on Arm’s design.\n\nMicrosoft’s fourth-quarter revenue jumped 18% last, due to artificial intelligence boosting adoption of its products. Azure revenue alone jumped 30%. MSFT stock will be minting millionaires for years to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:BURL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Interest rate relief also had a strong impact on more cyclical companies and those with ties to general consumer spending. For example, consumer discretionary holdings and discount retailers Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL) and Five Below both rose during the quarter thanks to improving outlooks. Five Below, a specialty value retailer for products including apparel, accessories, novelty items, décor, cosmetics and accent furniture, rebounded from being one of the third quarter’s worst-performing stocks. We believe both Five Below and Burlington are particularly well-positioned for an economic environment where consumer budgets are being tightened but demand for discretionary goods remains stable.”\n\nYou can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are downgraded.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.45(-0.25%)\n\nOn May 20, Barclays analyst Saket Kalia revised down the price target for Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) from $240 to $205 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. Following this adjustment, Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) stock price experienced a slight decrease of 0.25%. Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) operates in the cybersecurity industry and is set to release its fiscal Q3 report on May 30. Kalia's analysis anticipates billings of $584 million, but suggests that hitting $600 million is feasible, potentially alleviating concerns regarding the implied ramp-up in Q4. Despite expressing a desire to be more optimistic about the stock leading up to earnings, the analyst questions whether the Street's projection of 23% billings growth for fiscal 2025 needs adjustment for the stock to be more attractive for investors.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), BioNTech and Ingersoll Rand. Zscaler provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced solid financial results including 43% revenue growth and 38% growth in billings, which were both ahead of expectations. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (e.g., Office 365 and Salesforce) and more remote workers than before the pandemic make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. The stock has been a top performer this year, and we decided to trim the position based on valuation considerations.”\n\nYou can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are downgraded.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "title": "What Nvidia says about AI chip demand could matter for more than just the tech trade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence enthusiasm has been spreading across the stock market.\n\nWednesday night's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings call will mark a year since the chipmaker first shocked Wall Street with its demand for AI chips. Since then, mentions of AI have skyrocketed on earnings calls, growing 186% since the first quarter of 2023, per Bank of America Research.\n\nThis comes as the conversation around AI has quickly moved from AI chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) to AI power users like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). More recently, strategists have highlighted a broadening out to other sectors that could benefit from the increased power usage, like Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), and Commodities.\n\n\"It's not just about NVDA anymore,\" Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis shift has already been underway in the market. Several precious metals, including copper (HG=F), which strategists have said will benefit from AI spend, have hit recent highs. The Utilities and Energy sectors are two of the top-performing sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) this year, up about 15% and 13%, respectively.\n\nThis has trickled down to individual names that are now rivaling the meteoric stock rise of Nvidia since the start of 2024. Texas-based Vistra Corp (VST) is up roughly 140% this year, while Constellation Energy (CEG) shares have risen nearly 90%, which is about in line with Nvidia's rise this year.\n\nIn a note on Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson listed Utilities as an Overweight sector, noting it offers \"upside to the AI power theme.\" Wilson highlighted that the Power and Utilities team at Morgan Stanley believes electricity could rise from 3% of total US consumption in 2023 to about 10% by 2030, driven by new AI data centers that are 50 times the size of previous ones.\n\n\"Both traditional and alternative energy providers have upside revisions potential amid the increasing need for AI data center power and more favorable data center power deals,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nAnd companies have been playing up their role in the AI buildout too.\n\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter. More than 66% of companies in the Energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\n\nGiven the big-picture implications, investors will be closely watching Nvidia's report for color on AI chip demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus far, Nvidia has repeatedly surprised investors on this front, continuously topping analyst expectations for quarterly results and boosting its outlook for the coming quarter amid robust demand for its AI servers.\n\nWhether this trend holds or breaks could now have repercussions for a variety of sectors.\n\n\"If markets wake up to say, 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit,' and that's reflected in those valuations,\"' JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley told Yahoo Finance, \"that's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\" Nvidia Corporation logo is displayed on a smartphone screen, with a graphic representation of the stock market in the background.

        "content": "Don’t count Metaverse stocks to buy out just yet. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is shifting its focus on building out its artificial intelligence and metaverse technologies. Firms like HSBC are introducing a fund designed to seize opportunities in the metaverse for affluent clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nThis year, the global metaverse e-commerce market could grow 30% and reach a value of $30 billion this year. By 2025, the market could be worth $42 billion. By 2030, it could be worth more than $210 billion.\n\nThat being said, use weakness when choosing metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) gapped from about $40 to a low of $30 after cutting its annual bookings forecast. However, with the negativity now priced in, it’s starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $33.59, it’s also starting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R and could soon refill that bearish gap at around $40 again in the near term.\n\nRBLX is one of the top metaverse stocks to buy and hold long term.\n\nMoving forward, RBLX could easily push aggressively higher. For one, the company has about 16 million daily active users in the U.S. who spend about $150 annually. There are another 62 million outside of the U.S. who spend an average of about $24 a year.\n\nAlso, the company is opening a new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nIn addition, while we’ve seen multiple firms pile on with price downgrades, the pullback is overdone. The negativity has been priced in. And with the future potential growth of the metaverse, most notably metaverse e-commerce, RBLX is a steal at current prices.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeakness in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a buy opportunity.\n\nBut don’t wait too long to buy.\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $141 in earnings, it’s just starting to pivot higher again. Last trading at $166.33, I’d like to see AMD retest $180 again shortly. Helping, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just added AMD artificial intelligence chips to its cloud computing products.\n\nTwo, analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of AMD with a buy rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our views on NVDA and AMD haven’t changed, but the relative move in stock prices YTD causes us to make a tactical shift in priority, moving AMD to the Wolfe Alpha List, replacing NVDA, which is up ~90% YTD and ~100% since it was added to the list in November 2023,” added Wolfe.\n\nWe also must consider that companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) An image of a VR headset and headphones; the word metaverse on the headset. metaverse cryptos\n\nSource: PopTika/Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), it traded at around $12.41 on May 8. Still rebounding from its dip to $11.40, the METV ETF still offers a solid long-term opportunity on the metaverse.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U) and Microsoft to name a few of them.\n\nWith some of the top tech heavyweights on board, I’d buy the METV ETF at current prices and check back on it in a few months. From its last traded price of $12.55, I’d like to see it closer to $20, with its holdings in NVDA, AAPL and RBLX expected to explode higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "The next phase of technology has been established: machine learning and AI will revolutionize the world for the better. Although it might seem like these stocks are trading in a bubble, investors need to keep a discerning and keen long-term vision for these disruptive, emerging technologies. Some way or another, AI will grow to become a secular movement that nearly every industry, not every company in the world, will incorporate to increase productivity and efficiency.\n\nOf course, anxiousness about the AI bubble is not unwarranted. Preparing a well-diversified portfolio of the right stocks is crucial to avoid such major drawdowns. Just because a company mentions AI doesn’t mean it instantly becomes a good investment. We’ve already seen this with pullbacks in industries like EVs and fintech. So, if you want to gain machine learning exposure in your portfolio, consider these three machine learning stocks to buy and thank us in the coming five or ten years.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) went from a meme stock to a legitimate business, earning hundreds of millions each year in profits. The stock is trading right at the average analyst price target of $21.45 and has a street-high price target of $35.00. This high-end target represents a more than 60% upside from the current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis stock has been polarizing on Wall Street since its direct listing debut in September 2020. While the first few years were a roller coaster ride for investors, the stock is earning legitimate backing through its machine-learning integrated production deployment infrastructure. Additionally, the hype doesn’t get any more legit than Stanley Druckenmiller, who disclosed that he bought nearly 770,000 shares in the recent quarter! For those who don’t know him, Druckenmiller has long supported the ML revolution, with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) being his most recent win during its massive rally over the past year.\n\nThe problem with Palantir has always been its valuation. Currently, shares trade at 21x sales and 65x forward earnings. Nonetheless, growth prospects are looking strong now, with revenue growing at a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% and a three-year CAGR of 21%. As multiples begin to compress, investors should consider Palantir to be a legitimate money-making contender in the ML space.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Chinese technology company that recently amassed over 200 million users on its new Ernie AI chatbot. This year, the stock is down by about 4.0% as Chinese stocks have lagged the broader rally in US equities. Nonetheless, Wall Street has maintained an average analyst price target of $153.36, about 40% higher than the current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu recently made headlines after reporting it was interested in partnering with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to use its robotaxis in China. As China looks to get its hands on some for immediate rollout, investors should keep their eyes peeled for the unveiling of the CyberCabs in America this August. Not only will this potentially be one of the strongest new channels for revenue growth for both these companies, but Baidu’s race to get first movers advantage could solidify it as a leader in the Chinese automobile space.\n\nAs with many Chinese ADR stocks, the multiples for BIDU are low. For example, its P/E ratio of 9.79x is sitting 25% lower than its sector’s median! On top of such a discounted valuation, Baidu has maintained a strong 10-year revenue CAGR of 14%. Baidu looks like a bargain for investors who can tolerate the risk that comes with Chinese stocks.\n\nMicron Technologies (MU)\n\nMicron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) is an American chip maker with a major surge in demand due to AI and machine learning technology. Analysts are bullish on MU, with 28 of 31 recommendations coming in May as a Buy or Strong Buy rating. The average analyst price target is $145.52, nearly 15% higher than the current price.\n\nThis chip maker has already hit new all-time highs this month and is seeing revitalized product demand. This growth potential has largely been attributed to Micron being one of three companies in the world that make DRAM memory chips. These chips allow for storing massive amounts of data, which will help accelerate the training of AI and machine learning technologies. These DRAM chips account for 71% of Micron’s revenue as of Q2 2024, which bodes well for the stock’s upward momentum.\n\nUsually, when a stock trades at all-time highs, its valuations also stretch. That’s not exactly true for Micron, as shares are trading at just 7.5x sales and 17x forward earnings. As revenue growth accelerates, Micron sticks out as one of the more under-the-radar ways to gain exposure to AI and potentially join the million-dollar club.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "European stocks started the day on May 21 with a slightly weaker note, marking a retreat from their recent impressive performance, with attention now shifting towards the upcoming earnings report from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The Stoxx 600 index dipped by 0.2%, showing a predominantly negative trend across most sectors, while futures for US equities remained relatively unchanged. Options markets in the US indicate significant anticipation for NVDA earnings report this Wednesday, with traders expecting a notable shift in the chipmaker's shares, reported Reuters.\n\nWhile expectations are high, there's recognition that the upcoming earnings announcement could trigger significant market activity. Implied volatility for options suggests traders are prepared for both upward and downward movements in the stock price. Despite Nvidia's impressive performance this year, investors remain vigilant, aware that a substantial downturn in NVIDIA shares could test the resilience of the broader AI trade, emphasizing the significance of NVDA's role in shaping market sentiment and trends.\n\nA software engineer hosting a remote video training session on a multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution.\n\nMeanwhile, in Asia, shares took a breather following a week-long streak of gains. Investors remained vigilant regarding commodity prices, especially with the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index hitting its highest point since January 2023. Notably, gold and copper were trading near their historical peaks, adding to the market's attention.\n\nOn another front, oil prices experienced a decline, influenced by various market metrics suggesting a subdued outlook, despite heightened geopolitical tensions ahead of an OPEC+ meeting on supply. Brent crude's prompt spread narrowed to its smallest backwardation since January, indicating a potential shift in market dynamics, while the reduction in bets on crude price increases continued among money managers. Futures trading reflected a period of consolidation, with implied volatility levels nearing lows not seen since 2019.\n\nFrom Chinese property market side, analysts suggest that China's recent efforts to bolster the property sector will require patience to yield results. Despite these initiatives, S&P maintains its view that the market is still \"searching for a bottom.\" Edward Chan from S&P emphasizes the government's seriousness in stabilizing the property sector but notes that significant stabilization requires improvements in homebuyers' demand and confidence, which have been affected by a nearly three-year market downturn. According to CNBC, recent measures, including lowered down payment minimums and enhanced liquidity for developers, aim to address the challenges. However, analysts like Goldman Sachs' Hui Shan and Nomura's Ting Lu believe more substantial actions are needed, estimating a significant funding requirement to address inventory excess and stabilize prices. While progress is noted, challenges persist, as indicated by declining real estate investment and slower-than-expected retail sales growth. Rebuilding homebuyer confidence is crucial, particularly concerning delivery delays and economic uncertainty. Analysts anticipate further efforts from Beijing, including a national survey to assess funding needs for completing residential projects. Ultimately, restoring confidence in the presale system is seen as essential for a genuine recovery in China's housing markets. As market players navigate these developments, attention remains keenly focused on unfolding events and their potential impact on investment strategies and market sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on stocks such as MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) by lowering their price targets. For a comprehensive overview of MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) and other stocks affected by such adjustments, see Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks .\n\nMongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.88(+0.24%)\n\nOn May 20, Bank of America (BofA) lowered the price target for MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) from $500 to $470 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Following this adjustment, MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stock price increased by 0.24%. MongoDB operates in the database software industry and is set to release its Q1 results on May 30. According to BofA's Cloud View report, MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) Atlas platform is expected to show significant growth, with Q1 revenues projected to increase by 34.5% year-over-year to $320 million. The analyst reiterated that MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of the $108 billion database market.\n\nClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy stated the following regarding MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“New addition MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), in the IT sector, offers a leading modern database platform that handles all data types and is geared toward modern Internet applications, which constitute the bulk of new workloads. Database is one of the largest and fastest growing software segments, and we believe it is early innings in the company’s ability to penetrate this market. MongoDB is actively expanding its potential market by adding ancillary capabilities like vector search for AI applications, streaming and real-time data analytics. The company reached non-GAAP profitability in 2022, and we see significant room for improved margins as revenue scales.”\n\nYou can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are downgraded.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Ultimately, restoring confidence in the presale system is seen as essential for a genuine recovery in China's housing markets. As market players navigate these developments, attention remains keenly focused on unfolding events and their potential impact on investment strategies and market sentiment.\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on stocks such as D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) by lowering their price targets. For a comprehensive overview of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) and other stocks affected by such adjustments, see Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks .\n\nD.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.53(+0.35%)\n\nOn May 20, Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari revised the price target for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), a leading company in the homebuilding industry, from $191 to $181 while maintaining a Buy rating. Following this price target adjustment, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) stock price saw a modest increase of 0.35%. Pettinari's update reflects new assumptions about interest rates and recent activity levels from late April and early May. Despite anticipating a low double-digit year-over-year growth in single-family housing starts for 2024, the analyst now predicts more subdued pricing due to sustained higher interest rates, which are likely to keep incentives elevated. Additionally, Pettinari notes that the group's current valuations appear to be \"fair-to-full.\"\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The share prices of our investments in homebuilder companies – Toll Brothers, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Inc., and Lennar Corporation – gained 39.4%, 41.8%, and 33.2%, respectively, in the most recent quarter, in part due to the continuation of strong quarterly business results, management optimism about 2024 prospects, and a more than 100 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates during the quarter.\n\n2023 was an excellent year for the public homebuilders. Housing fundamentals were resilient despite the affordability challenges of elevated mortgage rates and home prices. Several years of pent-up demand, fears that mortgage rates could move higher, a dearth of inventory in the existing home market, and an overall housing supply shortage drove home buyers off the sidelines to “stretch their wallet,” in part due to fears that they could miss out on the opportunity to buy a home. The Fund’s homebuilding companies Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar increased 108.0%, 71.4%, and 66.3%, respectively, in 2023.\n\nThough we anticipate more modest gains for the Fund’s homebuilder investments in 2024, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar. Further, we continue to believe there is a compelling case for the homebuilder valuations to re-rate higher over time.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, D.R. Horton, Lennar, and Toll Brothers have demonstrated substantial resilience and operating prowess. Despite several black swan events – COVID-19, a sharp increase in mortgage rates from 3% to 8%, and supply-chain disruptions – each company has managed its business exceptionally well and demonstrated that the demand to buy homes is resilient.”\n\nYou can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are downgraded.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Following this adjustment, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stock price increased by 0.66%. The company, which operates in the agricultural machinery industry, delivered a \"strong beat\" in its Q2 earnings. However, it revised its guidance downward as it aims to significantly reduce its inventory levels. The analyst noted that the recent flooding in Brazil could positively impact row-crop prices and improve the outlook in other regions. Additionally, with easier comparisons, upcoming new product launches, and continued favorable pricing, the firm expects agricultural growth to be feasible next year.\n\nOakmark Fund stated the following regarding Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is a leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment with dominant market share in North America and Brazil. Despite its brand strength, technological capabilities and distribution advantages, the company’s stock price has recently fallen due to fears about a downturn in the agriculture business cycle. Longer term, world population and food demand are expected to increase annually yet land and labor devoted to agriculture are expected to decline. Deere seems well-positioned to benefit from this dynamic as farms will have to become more productive. We were pleased to purchase shares in Deere at a low double-digit multiple of our estimate of normal earnings power.”\n\nYou can visit Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks to see the other stocks that are downgraded.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These discussions have raised concerns given Taiwan’s critical role in global semiconductor production,\n\nAlso Read: Pay More for Chips Made Outside Taiwan as AI Demand Soars and Global Expansion Continues: Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nDuring a meeting with the Dutch government, ASML confirmed its ability to deactivate these machines remotely despite the threat. The Netherlands has conducted invasion simulations to better evaluate the risks.\n\nThis remote shutdown capability is specific to ASML’s line of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. It is crucial for producing the smallest and most advanced microchip transistors, with TSMC being the primary client.\n\nThese EUVs, essential for AI and sensitive military technologies, are the only ones of their kind and are produced exclusively by ASML in Veldhoven.\n\nASML’s EUV machines, each costing over 200 million euros, are tightly regulated. Influenced by U.S. pressures, the Dutch government restricts ASML from selling these machines to China due to the potential advantages it could give in the global semiconductor competition.\n\nU.S. influence has also led to the Dutch government’s recent actions to stop exports of ASML’s highly sophisticated chipmaking machines to China.\n\nBefore this, U.S. officials had already influenced ASML to cancel certain deliveries to Chinese firms.\n\nASML anticipates that the latest export-control measures will impact up to 15% of its sales to China this year.\n\nPrior reports indicated Huawei Technologies Co’s self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) patent bypassed the need for ASML’s EUV machines, which are restricted by U.S. embargo.\n\nIn November, Huawei outbid Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) for a significant artificial intelligence chip order from Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) as U.S. sanctions took effect.\n\nSimultaneously, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese companies reportedly planned substantial cuts in their Nvidia chip orders. Chinese cloud companies expect to reduce their orders for high-end AI chips from Nvidia.\n\nDespite a 5.5% decrease in overall imports in 2023, China’s imports of chipmaking machines surged by 14% to nearly $40 billion, the highest since 2015. This spike included a notable increase in imports from the Netherlands, driven by anticipation of stricter export controls.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: ASML shares traded lower by 1.21% at $928.04 premarket at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via ASML\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report ASML HOLDING (ASML): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article ASML and Taiwan Semi Prep for Potential China-Taiwan Conflict with Remote Shutdown Feature originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Seth Klarman 2024 Portfolio: Top New Stock Picks",
        "content": "Value investing is back in the limelight as investors prepare for a higher-for-long interest rate environment. Legendary value investor Seth Klarman had said in his 2000 letter to investors that while value investing might underperform the broader market amid changing investment sentiment, value investing as a basic investment principle and strategy would never go out of style.\n\n\"We are not seeking to keep up with any particular market index or benchmark. Rather, we are attempting to achieve good risk-adjusted investment results over time through the successful implementation of our investment philosophy. We continue to believe strongly in a value investment approach, attempting to buy assets or businesses at a considerable discount to underlying value. Bargains exist because the financial markets are inefficient, yet many investors lack the requisite patience and discipline to take advantage of them. A value approach may outperform or underperform the overall market at various times because of changing investor sentiment, but we believe that a value philosophy never goes out of style. When sentiment towards undervalued sectors of the market is at its nadir, it is the best time to be buying value.\"\n\nSeth Klarman is Investing in AI, Growth Stocks in 2024\n\nA cursory glance at Seth Klarman's Q1'2024 portfolio shows that the value investor is no longer limiting himself to defensive stocks with attractive valuation metrics. He's investing in some high-growth, loss-making companies as well which are expected to grow in the future. Klarman has time and again said that value investing does not mean adhering to a set pattern without any flexibility.\n\nWhat Makes a Stock Undervalued According to Klarman?\n\nIn his 2000 letter he said that he'd consider a stock undervalued if its undervaluation is \"substantial\" and there are enough catalysts to help it reach its true value in the future. Klarman also said the underlying business of the company he'd like to investing should be \"growing, not eroding.\"\n\nSeth Klarman wrote \"Margin of Safety\" back in 1991. The book, just like Klarman's investments, aged well, and after years of gaining no attention from the Wall Street, became a value investing bible and cult classic in the investing landscape. Talking about his book and investing philosophy on Capital Allocators with Ted Seides last year, Klarman said any piece of financial writing or advice should stand the test of time. He gave the example of  Security Analysis written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, saying the companies and case studies mentioned in the book are no more, but the principles and strategies continue to stay relevant. Klarman thinks even if humans are replaced by computers, these timeless investing principles will stay valid.\n\nStory continues\n\nKlarman also said chances of making money by investing in \"widely-followed\" stocks are not that high.\n\n\"Looking at what everybody else is looking at is probably not that interesting. If you are doing to look at what everybody else looks at, look at it in a highly differentiated way. But you are not going to make money by outsmarting people on widely followed stocks with an undifferentiated opinion.\" Seth Klarman Portfolio 2024\n\nBaupost Group Returns\n\nThe media-shy billionaire, worth about $1.3 billion, founded Baupost Group in 1982. While the fund doesn’t publicly share its returns, a Wall Street Journal report last year disclosed that Baupost has returned on average about 20% annually since its inception.\n\nFor this article we scanned Klarman's Q1'2024 portfolio and chose three exciting stocks he bought new stakes in during the first quarter. Unlike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), which everyone is buying, you will see some new names in the portfolio.

(NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $5,554,000\n\nValue investor Seth Klarman piling into a high-growth AI stock that has run more than 163% so far this year is news in its own. SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a California-based AI voice and speech recognition solutions company that came to the limelight following the AI revolution after the launch of ChatGPT. Seth Klarman's Baupost reported owning a $5,554,000 stake in SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) during the first quarter of 2024. In addition to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), AI-focused investors are also buying SOUN.\n\nFortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $12,194,000\n\nHealthcare solutions company Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) is one of the stocks Seth Klarman is buying in 2024. His hedge fund Baupost opened a $12,194,000 stake in Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) during the March quarter this year.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of 2023, 31 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE).\n\nIn May Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) posted Q1 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at -$0.04, missing estimates by $0.04. Revenue fell 4.6% year over year to $662.1 million, missing estimates by $92.48 million.\n\nUnlike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), FTRE is a small company with low hedge fund sentiment.\n\nVltava Fund mentioned Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“Value can be created in various ways. Acquisition is one possibility. So-called spin-offs represent another. This involves hiving off a part of a company into a separate entity and taking it to market. One such spin-off occurred last summer with LabCorp. It spun off a smaller part of the company under the name Fortrea Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:FTRE). For each of their shares, LabCorp shareholders received one share of the new Fortrea. It started trading at a fairly attractive price, so we sold immediately. Considering the price we got, we could say that this spin-off brought us some value, but it was only a one-off transaction and not a very large one at that.”\n\nGDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS)\n\nSeth Klarman's Stake Value: $17,290,000\n\nChina-based data center company GDS Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:GDS) is another growth stock Seth Klarman bought in the first three months of 2024.

        "title": "7 Reliable Blue-Chip Stocks That Cannot Miss",
        "content": "If you’re on the hunt for reliable blue-chip stocks to buy this month, look no further. Reliability is one of the most important factors when creating a winning investment strategy. One of the easiest ways to ensure reliability is by investing in blue-chip stocks. Blue-chip stocks represent well established companies with long track records of success. They often have a long history of reliable earnings and many times pay dividends. In short, they are among the most reliable investments available.\n\nIn general, what an investor gains in reliability by investing in blue-chip stocks, they lose in potential returns. All I’m saying here is that these firms are generally past their highest growth stages. Yes, you may be able to find faster growing firms but on average blue-chip stocks are going to win much more often.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) is the holding company anchored by Google which is itself anchored by its Google search business. Google search is again very strong which is very good news for the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors need simply look at the company’s first quarter earnings report in order to understand why Alphabet continues to be a strong investment. Google search revenues surged above $46 billion during the period. So too did YouTube ad revenue leading to strong increases in overall ad revenue for Google. Cloud growth was also impressive and overall revenues jumped from $69 billion a year ago to over $80 billion this quarter.\n\nThe stock also recently began paying dividends to investors. That’s one of the surest signs of overall stability in any company. Google pays an additional 20 cents for each share of stock owned. Silicon Valley’s Tech Giants are beginning to pay dividends and it’ll be interesting to see how they compete against one another in that regard. Growth is still the primary concern for tech companies but the Blue Chips like Google are also beginning to offer the reliability of quarterly income.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors should expect Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to perform very well in the coming months. Firstly, concerns around inflation are again easing following the April jobs report. It’s entirely likely that two rate cuts may still occur in 2024. That will pull Amazon and all of the stock market higher, particularly growth oriented tech.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon’s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts are coming into sharper focus. Recent news suggests that pressure is on in that regard. Jeff Bezos recently emailed Amazon executives prompting them to up AI efforts at the firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say the company hasn’t already invested in artificial intelligence – it has. The company recently concluded its $4 billion investment in Anthropic, one of the most important AI upstarts.\n\nI don’t necessarily think any of the big tech companies feel secure in their AI efforts at this stage. Each must be worried that critical errors have been made; that’s just the nature of investing in totally new technology.\n\nRemember, Amazon beat earnings by nearly 18% in the first quarter. It’s as strong a company as ever.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: Walmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) tends to be fairly steady across the economic cycle. the company can usually find a way to thrive no matter the macro environment. That is again proving true per first quarter earnings.\n\nConsumers are well aware that the cost of eating out has become prohibitively expensive in some cases. That’s a boon to Walmart’s grocery business, the largest grocer overall. Consumers are balking on restaurant eating and instead flocking to Walmart to buy ingredients for meal preparation. That’s one of the takeaways from Walmart’s strong first quarter earnings which came in better than expected.\n\nThe return to thriftiness is evidence across the economy. Other important firms including McDonald’s see strong consumer demand for value options. The company is reintroducing its $5 meal deal this summer.\n\nThat is another strong sign for discount retailers including Walmart which dominates the space. The American consumer looks to be shifting toward value again and Walmart, as we know, offers great value.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who follow MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock have become accustomed to an incredible pace of growth. The fintech payments and e-commerce powerhouse of Latin America continues that streak today and is one of the best Blue Chips to buy.\n\nMercadoLibre operates in 18 Latin American countries across five business divisions. Those divisions include A Marketplace, a payments division called Mercado pago, Personalized media division, Mercado shops, and a credit card business.\n\nThose businesses continue to grow at very rapid rates proven by the fact that Q1 net profits increased by 71%. MercadoLibre’s  success stems from its continued commitment to bring e-commerce and payments to what was traditionally an underserved Latin American market. The area isn’t growing by population but the opportunity remains large due to how traditionally underserved the area has been.\n\nFor investors who are worried that MercadoLibre shares are overpriced, consider that this metrics-based website believes they’re actually worth $150 more.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: PepsiCo (PEP) PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.\n\nSource: 8ED8 / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is a snacks and beverages giant that offers a can’t miss stock for investors. It’s become evident throughout this inflationary period that consumers will remain loyal to the company despite higher prices. Another way of putting that is to say that PepsiCo benefits from strong pricing power. Even as volumes fall the company manages to increase revenues through higher prices.\n\nThat’s the power of having strong brands within your portfolio which is very true of Pepsi. The company’s North American beverages business and its North American snacks business are the primary drivers of success. Fortunately, both continue to grow on the top line basis, again despite lower volumes.\n\nPepsi gave guidance for 4% Revenue growth throughout 2024, reiterating previous guidance. That’s indicative of stability and predictability which is the hallmark of blue-chip stocks. The company also expects earnings to increase by 8% in 2024. Earnings growth in excess of revenue growth is a strong sign that the company will continue to reward shareholders.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is probably the best stock for a conservative investor seeking reliable exposure to the chip sector. Other shares like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offer greater potential for outsized gains. Taiwan Semiconductor is their supplier and provides chips to the vast majority of so-called chip companies.\n\nI assume some investors must be worried about the general threats facing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing at this point. The threat of a Chinese invasion is one of those as is the continued onshoring threat from the United States.\n\nWell, if China ultimately invades Taiwan the results will be catastrophic for companies everywhere. There’s little that can be done to protect the company in that regard. It’s simply an unavoidable risk. The onshoring threat is a different story. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is heavily invested in U.S. efforts and is building foundries in Arizona. The point here is that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing provides the majority of the world’s semiconductors and despite any perceived risks is still among reliable blue-chip stocks to buy for that reason.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Amgen Inc (AMGN).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmgen (NYSE:AMGN) is one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to consider at the moment. The weight loss drug opportunity is the primary reason.\n\nAmgen is a blue chip stock and a member of the Dow. It’s generally seen as a reliable investment overall. However, another catalyst is currently emerging that makes Amgen an even stronger investment at the moment.\n\nThe company is one of the main challengers to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), who currently dominate the weight loss drug space. Amgen’s Answer to Wegovy and Mounjaro is a weight loss drug called MariTide. The drug requires fewer injections and may lead to longer term weight loss than the current alternatives.\n\nAmgen is one of the largest drug manufacturers globally. The point here is that the company is likely capable of garnering the manufacturing resources required to produce such high demand drugs. There’s a reasonable argument to be made that Amgen is the pharma stock that best blends stability and high upside at the moment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Worldwide Takeover: 3 Stocks Poised for Global Domination",
        "content": "Consider buying these stocks if you want your portfolio to grow!\n\nThe global stock market is undergoing profound transformations right now, with the rapid globalization of traditional companies, as well as the decentralization of the world’s largest companies, with many rising out of Asia, as opposed to the 20th and 21st centuries, which saw a great increase in companies which arose in the West.\n\nToday, I have focused on three stocks that I think have great potential in both the domestic and international markets and offer great solutions to various global problems. Additionally, all these companies have great growth potential, making them great stocks poised for global dominance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three stocks that I think you should invest in:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a semiconductor manufacturer offering international access to chip fabrication and engineering services, being best known for manufacturing chips for industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). TSM is trading at $153+ with a market cap of ~$680 billion.\n\nRevenue estimates are stable, ranging from $19.74 to $20.01 billion for this quarter. Additionally, TSM regularly beats estimates, with EPS surprising investors by 4.50% last quarter. Revenue and earnings held still, with quarterly YoY revenue growth of 16.50%, and quarterly YoY earnings growth at 8.90%.\n\nThe semiconductor sector has a projected CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. However, factors such as market volatility, supply and demand shocks, and geopolitical tensions could cause this growth to stagnate. To mitigate these risks, TSM is diversifying its factories out of East Asia and into more stable countries, which is why this stock is a buy.\n\nCelsius (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) develops, processes, markets, distributes and sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and internationally.\n\nCELH stock has seen year-over-year (YoY) quarterly revenue growth of 36.80% with an overall revenue of 1.41 billion dollars. Like TSM stock, Celsius regularly beats estimates, and EPS surprised investors by 42.10% last quarter. Celsius Holdings has had a profit margin of 18.63% along with an operating margin of 23.39% which further solidifies its appeal as a stock poised for global domination.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global energy drink market is still a growth market anticipated to outpace economic expansion by a wide margin. Celsius has to face some fierce competitors – companies like Red Bull and Monster. But great financials, an innovative product line, and plans to go international make CELH stock a must-buy.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides end-to-end intelligent workflow automation platform solutions for digital businesses in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and internationally. Currently, it is trading at ~$771, with a market cap of ~$158 billion.\n\nNOW stock has quarterly earnings growth of 131.30% and a huge positive operating cash flow of $3.84 billion. This has led analysts to set a price target of $860.88, representing a 12.5% growth potential. This is combined with the fact that both earnings and revenue have seen steady growth over the last few years.\n\nAdditionally, NOW has started to expand hiring by increasing the number of Salesforce employees it hires; with Salesforce being its biggest competitor. Stealing high-quality workers, great financials, and the opportunity to grow in an international market make this top-rated technology growth stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Focusing on short-term opportunities when investing is crucial. If you miss such opportunities, your regret could last a lifetime. These are three technology stocks you can’t ignore, chosen for their recent innovations and market approaches.\n\nThe first one stands out because of its substantial expansion in the data center market. The firm’s sales of server CPUs have increased by a noteworthy double-digit percentage. One of its GPUs has produced over a billion in sales in fewer than two quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one is making the most of its strategic realignment with Foundry Services and substantial government assistance. The firm showcased its growing client base by drawing hundreds of partners. The company’s ability to innovate and grow is strengthened by its acceptance of the largest prize from the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, the third one’s market penetration and inventiveness are demonstrated by the quick acceptance of its AI Platform (AIP) across various sectors. The company’s bootcamp approach has proven successful in shortening sales cycles and generating many new customers.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSales of server CPUs from AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) boosted by double digits. This was a major motion in the Data Center segment’s 80% year-over-year (YoY) top-line growth. In less than two quarters, MI300 generated over $1 billion in sales, the fastest ramp in AMD’s history.\n\nMoreover, its commercial acceptability and potential are reflected in its quick adoption and deployment in significant hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). With over 100 giant companies and AI clients, the MI300x is establishing new standards in AI performance. It leads the way in inferencing performance compared to the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100.\n\nFurther, AMD’s non-GAAP gross margin increased to 52%, up 2.3% YoY. This enhancement shows AMD’s rising operational effectiveness and profitability. In addition to making up a sizable amount of the overall revenue, these divisions had larger margins than the gaming and embedded segments.\n\nFinally, operating income increased significantly from prior quarters to $1.1 billion, or an operating margin of 21%. Higher revenues and effective cost control caused this margin increase. To this point, AMD has sustained high profitability even with a 10% YoY increase in operational expenditures, mostly for marketing and research.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) strategic realignment through Intel Foundry is one of its key competitive advantages. At its first-ever Intel Foundry Direct Connect, the firm brought together about 300 partners, clients, and prospective clients. Microsoft is the company’s fifth customer for the Intel 18A process node. The lifetime transaction value has been upgraded to surpass $15 billion. Hence, this significant achievement highlights Intel’s competitive standing in the semiconductor industry.\n\nMoreover, with the largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act—more than $45 billion in projected grants, tax breaks, and loans—Intel established a strong position as the nation’s leading semiconductor company. Thus, with this significant financial backing, Intel is better able to innovate and grow.\n\nAdditionally, Intel has made strides in data centers and AI. One significant advancement is the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which offers 40% more inference power efficiency and 50% quicker inference than rivals like Nvidia’s H100.\n\nLastly, Intel’s data center and AI (DCAI) business achieved 5% YoY growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. Therefore, the release of next-generation products, such as Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, further solidifies Intel’s lead in the server market.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) solutions, especially the AIP, are being adopted and expanded quickly, highlighting the company’s capabilities and market penetration. The AIP has applications across several industries, including healthcare, retail and energy, and has significantly increased revenue and client acquisition.\n\nMoreover, the company’s approach of holding bootcamps to highlight the benefits of its products has worked well. These bootcamps attracted over 915 firms, resulting in significant transaction cycle shortening. For instance, five days after finishing a bootcamp, a major utility firm inked a seven-figure agreement, demonstrating Palantir’s solutions’ instant effect and value realization.\n\nAdditionally, using production-level AI, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reduced the number of late jobs by 75% in only four months, serving over 1K customer support personnel. Similarly, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) used Palantir’s solutions more widely, leading to average yearly savings of almost $14 million.\n\nFinally, the U.S. Army selected Palantir as the exclusive prime contractor for the TITAN program’s next-generation targeting node, giving the company a contract worth approximately $178 million. Hence, this is the first major contract for a hardware system that a software business has won, a transformational milestone for the firm.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, INTC and PLTR.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy BEFORE Nvidia Reports Earnings on May 22",
        "content": "Industry darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to report results on May 22 and this is the most awaited event for tech investors. Positive results boost the market and take several other tech stocks higher. Artificial Intelligence driven companies have benefitted from the rally, and since AI is the next big thing, there is no way investors can ignore it. Tech leaders are betting on AI to achieve higher profit and growth and investors are on the lookout for tech stocks to buy.\n\nSeveral tech companies have seen their stocks surge over the past year, including Nvidia. If the company beats expectations again, we will see Nvidia inch closer to $1,000. Investors who think Nvidia stock is too expensive right now might want to take a look at these three tech stocks to buy that could rally after Nvidia’s earnings, driven by the positive market sentiment towards AI. Let’s dive deep into them.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s results will have multiple mentions of AI, and its biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is set to benefit from the positive market sentiment. Up 18% year-to-date, and 52% in the last 12 months, AMD stock is trading at $164 today. The stock looks undervalued to me and has the potential to hit $200 this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMD launched the MI300 AI GPU and saw a significant improvement in the data center revenue which was up 80% year-over-year to hit $2.3 billion in the recent quarter. This is just the beginning for AMD.\n\nThe company managed to achieve $1 billion in revenue in just two quarters through its MI300 computing system. Its accelerators are considered one of the best in the industry for generative AI, and several tech giants have shown interest in using AMD chips. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is offering AMD alternative to Nvidia AI processors for its cloud customers and this is set to benefit the company.\n\nDriven by stellar sales, management has raised the guidance for data center revenue to $4 billion for the year. AMD might not soar as aggressively as Nvidia, but it will keep moving upwards at a steady pace. Lastly, AMD has recently replaced Nvidia in the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been pounding the table about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock for a while and I think Nvidia’s strong results could benefit the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlready up 18% YTD, Oracle stock is trading for $123 today and has soared 5% since the news that the company is in talks with Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, for a $10 billion deal. While there is no confirmation yet, investors are optimistic about it, and it has helped the stock rally.\n\nOne solid reason to bet on this company is the rising demand for data centers. Tech giants are committing billions to build new data centers, and organizations are gradually shifting towards cloud.\n\nThe company is building 100 data centers and has seen a 29% YOY jump in performance obligations to $80 billion. This gives an idea about the future growth of the company. It reported impressive financials with a 25% rise in the cloud revenue for the third quarter. Its total revenue stood at $13.3 billion, whereas the cloud revenue was $5.1 billion. ORCL is one of the best tech stocks to buy now.\n\nI am not saying Oracle is a buy because of the anticipated deal with xAI. I am saying Oracle is a buy for its potential to deliver and stand strong amidst the growing AI competition.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother tech company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) has shown high volatility despite reporting strong quarterly numbers. PLTR stock is trading for $21 at the time of writing and hasn’t been able to soar after earnings.\n\nIt’s up 31% YTD and 83% in the past 12 months but is still trading lower than its $35 all-time high. Nvidia’s earnings could boost the stock and help it bounce back.\n\nThe company is focusing on profits in recent quarters and has achieved tremendous success with the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). In the first quarter, it saw a 27% YOY rise in commercial revenue and a 16% rise in government revenue. Its customer count was up 42% YOY and 11% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nThe market believes Palantir is trading at a rich valuation, and many are not happy with the second quarter guideline. However, I believe the company has potential to double your money by 2025. Its steady growth in the industry speaks for its strength and the ability to innovate.\n\nPalantir is a legacy business that has seen several market ups and downs. While the stock hasn’t been able to hit new highs lately, it still has the potential to rally. Half a dozen analysts have a buy rating for the stock after the results. PLTR is a solid long-term buy and hold.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Magnificent 7 stocks have continued to dominate the market, and while I think you should buy into those, there are also many other good stocks you should consider for a perfect portfolio. As the legendary Charlie Munger once advised his partner, Warren Buffett, it’s wise to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices instead of the other way around.\n\nHowever, Big Tech plus Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aren’t the only “wonderful” businesses out there. If I were to pick only seven perfect portfolio stocks, I would include just one from the Mag 7, complementing it with a diverse basket of quality businesses that’ll set the portfolio up for good performance in the coming decades.\n\nHere are the only perfect portfolio stocks you’d need.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you haven’t figured it out from the Munger quote already, I’m a big BerkshireHathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) fan. This is especially true nowadays due to the uncertainty about when rate cuts are going to come. The company simply has a lot of flexibility that other companies don’t. And if you’re building a perfect portfolio, buying up another near-perfect portfolio is a good idea.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has a boatload of cash ready to invest if there is a downturn, and if there isn’t, it has plenty of exposure to quality businesses. Investor confidence in Warren Buffett is as solid as ever, and you can see that with how much better the stock has performed compared to other asset managers.\n\nI have no doubt Berkshire Hathaway will continue to outperform the benchmark S&P 500 moving forward.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), along with Berkshire, should give you more than enough tech exposure. This is my favorite tech company, as the white-collar sector won’t survive without it. People may make do without any other Big Tech company, but Microsoft has made itself essential, especially with its smart AI investments.\n\nThe company reported highly positive quarterly results, surpassing projections on both revenue and earnings. Total revenue grew 17% to reach $61.9 billion, fueled by a 23% rise in Microsoft Cloud revenues to $35.1 billion.\n\nRevenue from Azure rose 31%, with AI-related services accounting for approximately 7 points of that increase. Remove the Personal Computing segment, and the revenue trend here has been very solid. Microsoft Revenue Growth. Perfect portfolio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nPositive signs for Microsoft’s ongoing digital transformation were reinforced by a 29% increase in bookings, driven by longer-term commercial commitments to Azure. This suggests that its “cloud flywheel” of mutually reinforcing cloud and AI businesses is working. The 0.71% yield sweetens the deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nItochu (ITOCF) Itochu Corporation office building in Japan. ITOCF stock.\n\nSource: Takashi Images / Shutterstock\n\nItochu (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) is not that well-known, but it is a very well-diversified company that I think deserves more attention. I believe it is the Berkshire Hathaway of Japan. The diversification here is some of the best you can find in one business. ITOCF segments. perfect portfolio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, near-term trends haven’t been the best. Management did report positive growth in FY2024, with revenues increasing slightly by 0.6% and net income growing marginally by 0.2%. Unfortunately, Itochu’s Energy & Chemicals segment experienced double-digit declining revenues because of lower prices.\n\nHowever, I don’t see any long-term problems here. The yen’s devaluation is causing near-term problems, but the stock’s performance shows that investors remain confident Itochu will keep compounding.\n\nIt has been a very stable company. Plus, the dividend is scheduled to rise to a record high of 200 yen per share, but the payout ratio will be a modest 32.5%.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a consumer goods giant known for brands like Tide, Bounty and Pampers. The stock will act as a great ballast for your portfolio, as Procter & Gamble has a very sticky demand for its products.\n\nIts earnings per share of $1.52 was above analysts’ estimates, up 11% year-over-year (YOY). However, PG’s total revenue of $20.2 billion missed Wall Street’s forecast by $241 million.\n\nResults took a hit from the weakness seen in China, where business was down 10%. On a more positive note, the United States market stayed very strong, with consumption growing by 5% and P&G gaining additional market share. PG US revenue. perfect portfolio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nManagement adjusted their prediction for higher full-year earnings, and they are now expecting growth in the range of 10% to 11%. This is enabled by expense savings, allowing over 300 basis points of margin expansion. The company’s guidance for organic sales growth through the end of the fiscal year was left at 4% to 5%, disappointing some investors who may have been hoping for an increased projection. While near-term headwinds from places like China are ongoing issues, Procter & Gamble’s overall strategy is still seen as on the right track.\n\nPressure on the top line appears to be slowing its momentum somewhat, but this is a surefire long-term bet for any perfect portfolio. The dividend yield is at a solid 2.4%.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) is a German chemical company. It also had a mixed earnings season, and its Q1 result was similar to that of Procter & Gamble. EPS beat, but revenue missed.\n\nEarnings per share grew 10% to reach $3.75, benefiting from higher prices and good cost management. Operating margins set a new record at 28.9%. However, total sales declined by 1% as volumes fell by 1% due to weak industrial activity in Europe over the past few months. However, long-term trends look very promising. Linde EPS growth. Perfect portfolio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nManagement expects demand to remain sluggish for now, particularly in Europe. They do not see any changes on the immediate horizon that would spark a global industry recovery. As a result, management has reaffirmed its full-year EPS guidance from $15.30 to $15.60. That’s still an 8% to 10% growth.\n\nThe company also has a $5 billion backlog to work with. Linde seems well-positioned to deliver continued mid-single-digit EPS expansion over the long run. The stock is down ~8% from its March high, and I think buying the dip is a good idea. There’s also a 1.3% dividend yield here.\n\nO’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) The logo for O'Reilly Auto Parts is displayed on a red building front.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) has experienced some softening after a disappointing Q1. Revenue did not meet expectations due to unpredictable demand from do-it-yourself consumers impacted by delays in tax reimbursements and inclement weather. Earnings per share of $9.2 also lagged the estimated targets. However, it was missed by a hair on both the top and the bottom line — an 11 cents EPS miss and a revenue miss of less than $5 million.\n\nManagement maintained the full-year sales guidance, calling for a 3% to 5% comparable stores growth rate, though EPS guidance was a bit below expectations. Executives anticipate sales patterns will stabilize as weather conditions return to a more typical pattern. Demand for fundamental automotive supplies like oil and filters appears to be holding steady.\n\nThe average car on the road is approaching 13 years old, and that aging fleet is only going to bring more business with time. Analysts expect EPS to grow from $42 to $112 from 2024 to 2033.

AI Recommended Energy Stocks in July\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTrane Technologies (NYSE:TT) is mainly an HVAC company. We’re seeing hotter and hotter summers, and this trend is having a very good impact on the company’s coffers.\n\nRevenue grew 15% YOY, reaching $4.22 billion. This was driven largely by HVAC solutions. Bookings rose 17% to a record $5 billion, and its commercial HVAC segment led the way with over 20% growth. The company’s order backlog increased 10% to $7.7 billion. To top it all off, adjusted EPS of $1.94 beat analyst estimates by 30 cents.\n\nManagement also raised their projection for full-year organic revenue growth. Originally estimated at 6% to 7%, they now expect 8% to 9% growth. Moreover, the stock’s current rally doesn’t seem overvalued to me due to the solid growth in cash flow. Trane cash flow\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe strong demand Trane is seeing for its commercial HVAC solutions is allowing the company to outpace the overall market growth. While the residential market situation is less certain, the commercial strength should continue powering increases in both its top and bottom line numbers. If 2024 turns out as hot as last year, expect even more outperformance here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet roughly 30 years ago, there have been no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends and innovations that promised to change the growth arc for corporate America. Unfortunately, none have come close to their billed expectations. However, artificial intelligence (AI) appears ready to give the internet revolution a run for its money.\n\nAI involves the use of software and systems in place of humans. In many instances, these systems have the ability to learn and evolve without human intervention. AI-driven software and systems becoming more proficient at their tasks, or perhaps even learning new tasks, gives the technology utility across almost every sector and industry. It's the driving force behind PwC's otherworldly estimation that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nHowever, not all of Wall Street's brightest investment minds are in agreement on how best to play the AI revolution. Although no company has benefited more directly from the rise of AI than semiconductor behemoth Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the latest round of Form 13F filings that details trading activity during the March-ended quarter shows billionaires were, once again, headed for the exit. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEight billionaire investors ran for the exit from Nvidia during the first quarter\n\nNvidia, which is set to report its latest quarterly operating results on Wednesday, May 22, has undeniably benefited from the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in high-compute data centers. More specifically, the H100 GPU is the go-to for businesses looking to train large language models and operate generative AI solutions.\n\nLast year (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on January 28), this surge in demand for AI-GPUs more than doubled the company's full-year sales and sent Data Center segment revenue screaming higher by 217%.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about Nvidia's growth in fiscal 2024 is that it was predominantly driven by the company's phenomenal pricing power on its AI chips. With demand overwhelming supply, Nvidia had no trouble increasing the price of its top-selling GPUs.\n\nDespite these catalysts, eight billionaire money managers -- technically nine if you include recently passed billionaire Jim Simons who founded Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Nvidia stock in the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe primary reason these billionaires continued to show Nvidia shares to the door might very well be history. There hasn't been a single next-big-thing trend or innovation for three decades that didn't work its way through an early innings bubble. Investors often overestimate the adoption/uptake of new technologies, leading to bubbles. There isn't a stock that would be hurt more in the short run by the AI bubble bursting than Nvidia.\n\nThese more than half-dozen billionaire asset managers are likely also thinking about how competition will adversely impact Nvidia. Both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have introduced AI-accelerating GPUs that'll go to head-to-head with Nvidia's H100 in high-compute data centers.\n\nBut the bigger concern might be the competition Nvidia is facing from within. Its four top customers -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- make up about 40% of its net sales. But all four of these industry leaders are currently developing AI chips of their own. Even if these chips are purely to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs, it means reduced orders after the current year.\n\nLastly, increased competition will reduce the AI-GPU scarcity that's allowed Nvidia to raise its prices into the stratosphere. As its pricing power declines, so should its gross margin.\n\nYet not every AI stock found itself on the chopping block by Wall Street's smartest money managers in the first quarter. The following two supercharged artificial intelligence growth stocks were popular buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe first AI stock that whet the whistle of Wall Street billionaires as they were dumping shares of Nvidia in the March-ended quarter is cybersecurity juggernaut CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). Four prominent billionaires upped their positions in the latest quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (706,283 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (297,097 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (154,688 shares)\n\nThe great thing about cybersecurity is that it's steadily evolved into a basic necessity service. Businesses of any size that have an online or cloud-based presence require protection at all times from robots and hackers that seek to steal their sensitive information. Subscription-driven third-party cybersecurity solution providers like CrowdStrike are finding their services in high demand.\n\nThe secret sauce that makes CrowdStrike tick is its Falcon security platform. Falcon is cloud-native, reliant on AI and machine learning, and oversees trillions of events each week. This is to say that it's becoming more efficient at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time.\n\nThe testament to this efficacy can be seen in its gross retention rate. Despite not being the cheapest endpoint security provider by any measure, gross retention has increased from below 94% to a pretty consistent 98% in less than seven years. Businesses have demonstrated a willingness to pay more for a product that's successfully defending against breaches.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike's existing clients are spending more with the company as they grow. In fiscal 2017, a single-digit percentage of its customers had purchased four or more cloud-module subscriptions. As of Jan. 31, 2024, the end of the company's latest fiscal year, 64% of its customers had adopted five or more cloud modules. These add-on sales are rapidly pushing the company toward its operating model goal of an adjusted subscription gross margin of 82% to 85%.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nA second supercharged artificial intelligence growth stock that billionaires were buying as they reduced their respective stakes in Nvidia is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Newly filed 13Fs show that five successful billionaires purchased shares of Palantir in the quarter ended in March, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (3,216,525 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,368,832 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (769,965 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (481,634 shares)\n\nOne of the main reasons billionaires have been attracted to Palantir is its unique operating model. The company's AI-driven Gotham platform helps federal governments collect data and plan missions, among other tasks. Meanwhile, the more recently launched Foundry platform is geared at helping larger businesses make sense of their big data in order to streamline their operations. At scale, no company comes close to doing what Palantir can. On Wall Street, irreplaceability can be quite valuable.\n\nFor years, Palantir's Gotham platform was responsible for much of its growth. Government contracts are typically spread out over four of five years, which leads to highly predictable cash flow. But this is a segment with a ceiling. In other words, there are certain countries (e.g., China) that Palantir's management would never allow access to Gotham.\n\nAlthough it's still relatively early in its launch phase, Foundry is on track to be Palantir's long-term breadwinner. Palantir closed out the first quarter with 427 commercial customers, which represents a 53% improvement over the year-ago quarter. U.S. commercial customer count growth was even faster (up 69% year-over-year to 262). As Palantir lands larger businesses with Foundry, it should see its cash flow meaningfully expand.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires with Palantir is its balance sheet. The company closed out March with nearly $3.9 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt. It's a company that's ready for whatever the U.S. and global economy throws its way.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence revolution has caused a growth surge for the technology's enablers, most of which reside in the semiconductor sector.\n\nIn fact, the stock movements for these companies have been so strong that many now trade at very, very high stock prices, setting these AI beneficiaries up for a potential stock split.\n\nStock splits don't create or destroy any value on their own. After all, if a company has twice as many shares but half the stock price, the company's total market cap remains the same. However, stock splits can help certain people afford shares if they don't have a broker that allows fractional share buying. Moreover, splits can increase a stock's liquidity, which can help lower-bid-ask spreads for trading purposes, and therefore attract larger funds to a stock.\n\nTherefore, even though the following five stocks have already had very strong runs, a split could potentially drive these AI winners to even further upside.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFirst and most obvious on the list is AI GPU leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Not only is Nvidia currently leading the entire AI revolution with its best-in-class AI chips and software ecosystem, but it also has a history of stock splits. While Nvidia split its stock a few times in the early 2000s, its most recent was a 4-for-1 split in July 2021.\n\nOf course, with the stock having quintupled since that split a mere three years ago and its share price reaching $944 as of this writing, it's not a stretch to the think the company may choose to split its stock again.\n\nNvidia anticipated the AI revolution well before other peers did, giving it a long multi-year lead. In fact, Nvidia has been investing in its CUDA software ecosystem since 2006. CUDA allows developers to program Nvidia's graphics processors for data processing, thus enabling AI. Fast forward to the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, and that foresight looks like a stroke of genius. The 17-year head-start on the competition has allowed for some nice network effects, with AI developers building most of their applications with CUDA and making it difficult for competitors to make inroads.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels; last October, management declared it would double the speed at which it introduces a new chip architecture, from once every two years to once per year. On that note, management introduced its new Blackwell architecture in March, which will be hitting the market in late 2024. These new AI chips offer a big leap forward over even the current Hopper architecture, offering 2.5 times the training performance and up to five times the inference performance over its predecessor.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has its Q1 earnings release tomorrow on Wednesday, May 22, and all indicators point to its strong AI-fueled hypergrowth continuing. Will Nvidia split its stock again? Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nOne AI stock that has had even better returns than Nvidia over the past three years is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Sure, a lot of Super Micro's recent success is owed to Nvidia's AI chips, but SMCI's returns in the stock market have actually been far superior. Since July 2021, the last time Nvidia split its stock, Nvidia is up by five times. But Super Micro's stock has increased a whopping 25 times over in less than three years. As a result, Super Micro's stock price has appreciated to about $900 per share as of this writing, setting it up for a potential split.\n\nA good part of that outperformance was a result of Super Micro's starting from a significantly lower valuation. In the past, its server products were thought of as \"commoditized\" with a lot of other competitors in the space.\n\nBut the AI revolution has exposed the business model strengths CEO Charles Liang had been cultivating for 30 years. Architecting its servers out of, \"building blocks,\" or creating the smallest possible modules or server components independently, then being able to build servers out of any combination of these components, Super Micro has mass-customization capabilities that enable it to satisfy virtually any customer modification request. Not only that, but the architecture also saves on costs, as parts of a server can be refreshed instead of having to replace an entire system.\n\nMoreover, Liang has stressed energy-efficiency in its server design for some 20 years, far before it was fashionable. But with the enormous electricity needs and costs of AI servers, Super Micro's efficient designs are finding even more favor today. And with offices right in the heart of Silicon Valley close to Nvidia and other chipmakers, Super Micro is often able to stay ahead of competitors with the latest in-demand features such as liquid cooling, and is often first-to-market with servers containing the latest and greatest chips.\n\nWhile Super Micro's P/E ratio has ballooned from the single digits to 50 over just the past few years, it's also displaying the growth to back it up, with a stunning 200% growth last quarter. As such, I'd expect Super Micro's share price to at least maintain these valuation levels, with a stock split potentially in the cards. Super Micro stock has seen the biggest gains from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nAnother AI beneficiary is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), thanks to two main factors. First, Broadcom makes the world's leading networking and routing chips with its Tomahawk and Jericho brands, and data center networking needs are exploding thanks to the data-intensive nature of AI.\n\nSecond, Broadcom has application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) design IP that third parties can use to make AI accelerators. In this area, Broadcom has landed some big fish, with both Alphabet and Meta Platforms using the company's ASICs to design their own in-house AI accelerators.\n\nAs a result of its highly cash-generative business and AI-fueled growth, Broadcom has seen its share price rally to over $1,400 per share. That definitely puts it in the running for a stock-split.\n\nOf course, the AI boost has only been the most recent catalyst pushing Broadcom's stock. Even before the AI revolution, Broadcom was an impressive winner thanks to CEO Hock Tan's visionary acquisition strategy. Over the past 18 years under his tenure, Tan has sought to acquire strong semiconductor franchises, then cutting costs as these defensible niche technologies are folded into the Broadcom corporate umbrella.\n\nThen in 2018, Tan expanded Broadcom's reach when it bought its first software company, California Technologies, diversifying the chipmaker into software, albeit still within its main enterprise infrastructure market. After buying cybersecurity firm Symantec in 2019, Broadcom made its biggest purchase yet in VMware, a software leader that enables hybrid cloud capabilities and data center virtualization. VMware should also benefit from the growth of AI as customers use many clouds with unique capabilities while striving to keep their data safe in their own data centers. As a result of the VMware acquisition, which closed late last year, Broadcom's software mix has grown to roughly 40% of revenues.\n\nNow, Broadcom isn't just a chipmaker, but a diversified technology platform company with many ways to win. Look for its profitable growth to remain strong in the years ahead. Both chipmakers and equipment stocks are all benefiting from the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. ASML Holdings\n\nThe path to making every leading-edge semiconductor, Nvidia GPUs included, runs through ASML Holdings(NASDAQ: ASML). This is because the Netherlands-based lithography company has a monopoly on key extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology needed to make today's most advanced chips.\n\nEUV technology took some 20 years to develop with significant buy-in from ASML's customers to fund leading research, so don't think that EUV capabilities can be copied anytime soon. The resulting technology allows for chipmakers to draw extremely fine transistor designs with light wavelengths that do not occur naturally on earth. And ASML's latest version of EUV, called \"high-NA\" EUV, can print designs down to widths of just 8nm. ASML is set to rake in the dough from high-NA, just introduced late last year, as these machines currently go for between $300 million and $400 million a pop!\n\nEUV only began to be used commercially in 2018, with the first EUV-enabled products coming out in 2019. So, we are still only at the beginning of the EUV era. As such, ASML has seen its stock rocket 367% over the past five years, reaching $940 per share, thus making it a candidate for a stock split.\n\n5. Lam Research\n\nLike ASML, Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX) is a semiconductor equipment leader that has also seen shares rally over the semiconductor bull market. But whereas ASML is the de facto leader in lithography, which draws designs on a silicon wafer using extremely fine light, Lam's technology does the exacting and painstaking work of etching the printed design and then depositing semiconductor material in extremely intricate patterns to construct the chip.\n\nWhile Lam doesn't have a clear monopoly over etch and deposition technology like ASML does with EUV, Lam actually does have a monopoly over certain process steps in the chipmaking process. More specifically, Lam dominates the deposition technology crucial to \"stacking\" chip components in a vertical fashion. Over the past decade or so, that has led to Lam benefiting from the production of 3D NAND flash chips, in which memory-makers stack storage modules in a \"3D\" fashion in greater and greater numbers of layers with every generation.\n\nNow, logic and DRAM chips crucial for AI are also \"going vertical,\" including high-bandwidth memory DRAM that is currently seeing such strong demand from AI applications. In fact, on its January conference call with analysts, Lam management noted it had a 100% market share in certain technologies needed for stacking DRAM modules. And with new gate-all-around transistors and 3D designs making their way into logic chips, look for Lam to get a further AI boost in the years ahead.\n\nThat's why shares have rocketed 385% over the past five years to $941 per share as of this writing, setting this strong compounder up for a possible stock split as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Futures muted, Palo Alto Networks' billings forecast - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures tread water as markets gear up for much-anticipated earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) this week and assess fresh interest rate commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers. Shares in Palo Alto Networks slip in extended hours trading after the cybersecurity group's fourth-quarter billings forecast fails to impress analysts. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) shakes up the leadership of its semiconductor division in a bid to keep pace in the race to roll out AI-specialized chips.\n\n1. Futures tread water\n\nU.S. futures hovered around the flatline on Tuesday, as investors looked ahead to quarterly earnings from artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia later this week and gauge interest rate commentary from Federal Reserve officials.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures had inched higher by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had edged down by 9 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the stand-out performer in the prior session, with the tech-heavy index closing at an all-time record high thanks to bubbling enthusiasm over the upcoming results from Nvidia. Markets are keen to see if the semiconductor group, whose chips have made it a focal point of booming interest in the possible applications of AI, will deliver yet another quarter of massive growth despite increasing competition.\n\nCommentary from several Fed policymakers, meanwhile, indicated that the central bank still wants to see more evidence that inflation is sustainably cooling to its 2% target before rolling out any possible interest rate reductions this year. But the statements did little to persuade traders to recalculate wagers that the Fed will unveil a cut as soon as September.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks posts disappointing billings forecast\n\nShares in Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) slipped in extended hours trading after the group's outlook for fourth-quarter billings received a tepid response from some analysts.\n\nLike other cybersecurity firms, Palo Alto has been facing weakness in spending by clients concerned by an uncertain economic environment. Customers, wary of the possible risks posed by placing all of their digital security needs in the hands of one company after a recent spate of high-profile breaches, are also investing in multiple vendors.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Chief Executive Nikesh Arora noted that Palo Alto's ongoing attempt to consolidate its users on to one centralized platform has enjoyed \"initial traction.\" However, he said this strategy has driven an increase in bookings with deferred payments and impacted billings, adding that this trend is \"something we expect will continue.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto estimates that fourth-quarter billings will be between $3.43 billion and $3.48 billion, roughly in line with estimates at the midpoint. But analysts cited by Reuters called the guidance \"lackluster.\"\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front on Tuesday, DIY-retailer Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) and aftermarket auto parts seller AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) are due to report prior to the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\n3. More Fed speak ahead\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is set to be latest official from the central bank to deliver public comments this week, with markets on the lookout for any clues about the path ahead for interest rates.\n\nWaller will speak on the outlook for the U.S. economy, according to the Fed's events calendar.\n\nSeveral of his colleagues sounded a mostly cautious note on Monday, saying that they have yet to see sufficient evidence that a cooldown in U.S. inflation will be long-lasting. As a result, they largely suggested that rates will need to stay at their currently elevated level of 5.25% to 5.5% until there is more proof that price pressures are abating.\n\nThe Fed's next policy meeting is slated for June 11-12. Traders are widely betting that officials will leave rates unchanged at the gathering.\n\n4. Samsung Electronics taps new head for chip unit\n\nSamsung Electronics has named a new head of its semiconductor division, as the South Korean manufacturer looks to keep pace with its rivals in the ongoing race to develop AI-optimized chips.\n\nMemory chip veteran Young Hyun Jun has been appointed to helm the unit, replacing Kyehyun Kyung, Samsung said on Tuesday. The company argued that the shake-up will strengthen the segment's competitiveness \"amid an uncertain global business environment.\"\n\nThe move comes as analysts are flagging that Samsung is trailing peer SK Hynix in the intensifying push to develop the high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nSamsung, which is targeting a tripling of its HBM supply this year, has already begun mass production of its HBM3E chips, according to the Financial Times.\n\n5.

        "title": "Asian Stocks Look Mixed as Traders Await Nvidia: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks are set for a listless day following a cautious session on Wall Street as traders keenly await Wednesday’s earnings from Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the heart of the artificial-intelligence frenzy that’s powered the bull market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash Site Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’ One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks\n\nFutures pointed to gains for Japanese stocks, losses in Hong Kong and a slight dip in Australia. The S&P 500 closed up 0.1% around 5,308, near all-time highs. Nvidia — — the last of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies to report earnings this season — rallied on a bullish analyst call. Investors are waiting for evidence that the numbers will renew confidence in the insatiable demand for its chips. US futures were steady in early Asia trading.\n\n“For the market to keep momentum this week, it may come down to just one stock - Nvidia,” said Jay Woods at Freedom Capital Markets. “Well, that’s not exactly true, but it sure feels like the hype for this earnings event will be the talk of trading desks and financial media all week.”\n\nEther led a surge in digital assets on speculation that opposition is easing to an exchange-traded fund tracking the second-biggest cryptocurrency. JPMorgan Chase & Co. slid as Jamie Dimon said the bank won’t buy back much stock at “these prices.”\n\nAnother raft of Federal Reserve speakers only reiterated the wait-and-see approach on rates. Treasuries edged lower at the start of a busy week for investment-grade issuance as firms rush to sell bonds ahead of the US holiday weekend. Ten-year yields rose two basis points to 4.44%.\n\nIn Asia, China’s economic struggles remain in the spotlight, with fresh data showing there’s little sign of a turnaround in its debt-plagued property sector. Local governments reaped the least revenue in eight years through land sales last month, showing the fiscal strains faced by those authorities who depend on such revenue for a large chunk of their total income.\n\nOn Monday, Japan’s benchmark government bond yield climbed to the highest since 2013 on bets the central bank will further raise interest rates to support the struggling yen. The yield on 10-year government debt rose 2.5 basis points to 0.975%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 has set multiple records in 2024 as US stocks have been on a $12 trillion rally since late October. One part of that is hopes for a soft landing with the economy staying moderately strong while inflation cools, which is spurring bets the Fed will cut rates this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother part is enthusiasm for AI technology. Chip giant Nvidia on its own is responsible for about one-fourth of the gains in S&P 500. And together with Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc., roughly 53% of the benchmark’s rise is coming from just five stocks.\n\n“Not since the likes of Cisco in the late ‘90s can we remember a single stock having such an enormous influence on the outlook for the market as a whole,” said Jason Trennert at Strategas Securities. “Nvidia’s earnings announcement last May made even the most-skeptical investors on the future of AI take notice.”\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson now sees the S&P 500 rising 2% by June 2025, a major about turn from his view that the benchmark will tumble 15% by December. The strategist — whose bearish 2023 outlook failed to materialize as markets kept rallying — finally gave in and boosted his target for the S&P 500 to 5,400 points from 4,500.\n\nElsewhere, commodities traders will be looking to see if the rallies that saw both copper and gold surge to all-time highs on Monday can be maintained. Brent hovered near $84 a barrel after posting its first weekly advance this month, while West Texas Intermediate settled near $80.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nFed’s Thomas Barkin, Christopher Waller, John Williams, Raphael Bostic, Susan Collins, Loretta Mester speak, Tuesday US existing home sales, Wednesday Fed minutes, Wednesday Nvidia earnings, Wednesday Eurozone S&P Global Services PMI, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, consumer confidence, Thursday G-7 finance meeting in Stresa, Italy, May 23-25 US new home sales, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed’s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday US durable goods, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday Fed’s Christopher Waller speaks, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 rose 0.1%; futures were flat as of 7:20 a.m. Tokyo time Hang Seng futures fell 0.7% S&P/ASX 200 futures fell 0.1% Nikkei 225 futures rose 0.4%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1% The euro was unchanged at $1.0857 The Japanese yen was little changed at 156.21 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin rose 0.6% to $69,899.07 Ether rose 4.7% to $3,664.35\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 4.44%\n\nCommodities\n\nSpot gold rose 0.2% to $2,429.31 an ounce West Texas Intermediate Crude fell 0.2% to $79.65 a barrel\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell slightly on Tuesday as a stimulus-driven rally in Chinese markets ran dry, while concerns over high for longer interest rates also chipped away at sentiment.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index was the worst performer for the day, battered by a rout in electric vehicle and technology stocks.\n\nBroader regional technology stocks also stalled as investors grew uncertain ahead of closely-watched earnings from artificial intelligence darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), due this Wednesday.\n\nWall Street indexes provided middling cues to Asian markets, after logging a mixed close on Monday. While strength in tech drove the NASDAQ Composite to record highs, most other sectors lagged amid persistent uncertainty over interest rates. U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in Asian trade.\n\nChina rally stalls, more stimulus cues awaited\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, retreating from their highest levels seen in 2024 so far.\n\nLocal markets were subject to some profit-taking after a stellar rebound over the past two months.\n\nBut markets were also waiting to see how Beijing would roll out its latest list of stimulus measures, and their potential effects on the economy. While optimism over more stimulus was a key driver of China’s recent stock rally, markets were now waiting to see just how much the measures would support the economy.\n\nAnalysts said the rollout of China’s stimulus packages will be the key to an economic recovery, particularly the ones aimed at the beleaguered property market.\n\nHong Kong stocks slide on EV, tech losses\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index was the worst performer in Asia on Tuesday, sliding as much as 2% from a nine-month high.\n\nThe outsized loss was driven chiefly by a nearly 20% slump in shares of Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) Inc (HK:2015), after the electric vehicle maker clocked disappointing first quarter earnings. Losses in Li spilled over into other EV stocks, with BYD (SZ:002594) Co Ltd (HK:1211) and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) down over 3% each.\n\nHong Kong’s biggest tech stocks also fell for idiosyncratic reasons. Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) slid 3% after its hotly anticipated Dungeon&Fighter mobile game was taken offline just an hour after its launch.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) fell 1% after its cloud unit further slashed prices, specifically for the firm’s Tongyi Qianwen AI bot.\n\nBaidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU) sank 3%, tracking losses in its peers.\n\nBroader Asian markets moved in a flat-to-low range, as investors awaited more cues on U.S. interest rates this week. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%, while the broader TOPIX index rose 0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 fell 0.3% after the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s May meeting showed the bank did consider raising interest rates to combat sticky inflation.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.5%, while futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks retreat as China rally cools, Hong Kong slammed by tech rout\n\nStar shares plunge as investors doubt validity of takeover bid by Hard Rock\n\nAustralia, New Zealand send evacuation flights to New Caledonia\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a game-changing technology, but it will take many years, maybe decades, to change the world. That means there is still plenty of time to position your portfolio to capitalize on AI and reap the rewards of this new technology and its long-term impact.\n\nWe know that AI chips are powering these innovations; the blue chip AI stocks of the future could depend on this need for AI chips and which companies come out on top. Here are a few AI chip stocks you can buy today and confidently hold for decades.\n\n1. The winner of the AI chip battle\n\nAI chips are the building blocks of the technology, so it's hard to mention any long-term stock list without leading off with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has between 80% and 90% of the AI chip market today.\n\nSuch a head start is a moat in its own right because competitors now have to convince companies that are building AI architecture to switch to their chips.\n\nThe long-term opportunity for Nvidia is based on how big the AI chip market could still get. Studies see a surge in data-center demand over the coming years, which could stretch the market to as high as $400 billion over the next several years -- multiples larger than where it stands today.\n\nWhat will that chip market look like in 2030, 2040, or 2050? Nobody knows just how powerful AI can become, but we do know that more-powerful AI requires better chips, and nobody has the market cornered like Nvidia when talking about the cutting edge.\n\nIt's a $2 trillion company, and sustained AI demand could keep cash flow strong enough to fund years of aggressive share repurchases and dividends that fill shareholder's pockets. It's hard not to like Nvidia, even if its multibagger days are over.\n\n2. The runner-up chip company with upside\n\nIt's hard to imagine one company completely running away with such a large addressable market. Other companies can find a seat at the table, too.\n\nMy pick for one of the other competitors is Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). AMD has proved its ability to penetrate markets by establishing CPU footholds in personal computers and data centers against incumbent Intel.\n\nThere's already some evidence that AMD also has found success in AI. The company recently unveiled a new generation of AI chips, which CEO Lisa Su touted as technologically superior to Nvidia's popular H100 chipset.\n\nTechnology keeps moving the goalposts, but AMD was able to tell the market that it has received interest from major AI players Microsoft and Meta Platforms. With data center revenue reaching \"just\" $2.3 billion in the first quarter, there's a lot of room for expansion, especially if the AI chip market grows to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD is a much smaller company with a market cap of $250 billion, a fraction of Nvidia's size. And it might only get a small part of the AI chip market compared to Nvidia. However, that doesn't mean it can't generate stellar investment returns in its own right. Count AMD as a sneaky growth candidate for the decades ahead.\n\n3. Who will build these chips?\n\nDon't assume that all these chip companies build their products -- they don't. Instead, they use companies called fabricators to make the chips for them.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) is the world's largest chip fabricator. According to Statista, TSMC, as it's also known, builds approximately 61% of the world's semiconductors. That means it will have the most capacity and advanced tools to build the cutting-edge chips needed to power AI's best and brightest applications.\n\nBuying stock in TSMC means you don't need to care whose chips reign supreme as long as it's building them. In investing slang, that's called a pick-and-shovel investment. It could be the smart way to play an AI war that could continue for years.\n\nThis company has some risks, primarily geopolitical concerns about China invading the country. That could mean the stock never trades at a valuation reflecting TSMC's growth and fundamentals.\n\nBut if you have the stomach for such risks, finding another company as essential to AI as Taiwan Semiconductor is will be hard. This could be a multidecade winner if peace is sustained in Asia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Monday as momentum on Wall Street stalled after buying into technology stocks, ahead of earnings from market darling Nvidia, put the Nasdaq at record highs.\n\nUncertainty over interest rates also remained in play as warnings on sticky inflation from Federal Reserve officials continued to trickle in, with focus on the minutes of the central bank’s late-April meeting due this Wednesday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,331.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.1% to 18,748.50 points by 19:20 ET (23:20 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,923.0 points.\n\nTech strengthens ahead of Nvidia earnings\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to report quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether the firm can meet market expectations for an exponential jump in earnings.\n\nThe company is seen as a bellwether for the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry, and its earnings are likely to set the tone for the broader technology sector.\n\nNvidia is at the heart of a massive spike in market valuations over the past year, amid increasing hype over the rapidly-growing AI industry.\n\nTech stocks saw sustained buying ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, which also helped push the NASDAQ Composite to a record high close on Monday. The index vastly outperformed its Wall Street peers.\n\nNvidia rose 2.5% and was close to a record high. Its peers Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, with all three stocks seeing some gains in aftermarket trade.\n\nTech heavyweights including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) advanced between 0.4 and 1.3%.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,308.13 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.7% to a record high of 16,794.87 points on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, falling 0.5% to 39,806.77 points.\n\nMore Fed cues awaited amid rate uncertainty\n\nMarkets still remained on edge ahead of more cues from the Fed this week, specifically the minutes of its last meeting and addresses by several officials.\n\nWhile mildly softer consumer inflation readings for April sparked a rally on Wall Street, a slew of Fed officials warned that the bank still needed much more confidence that inflation was coming down, before it could begin cutting interest rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Tom Barkin and New York Fed President John Williams are set to speak later on Tuesday. Both officials are members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe central bank is expected to potentially begin trimming rates by September, although this will also largely depend on the path of inflation.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures tread water; Nvidia anticipation puts Nasdaq at record high\n\nUS regulator to probe VinFast crash in California in which four died\n\nTrip.com ADR earnings missed by Â¥1.09, revenue fell short of estimates\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(1:30) - Why Are Nvidia’s GPU’s So Important To AI? (11:00) - What Price Target Should Investors Expect From Nvidia Going Forward? (14:50) - Nvidia’s Big Competition: Breaking Down AMD As It Helps With GPU Demand (21:35) - GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF: NVDL (37:35) - Big Takeaways From The Evolving AI Industry Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nIn this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Zacks Senior Stock Strategist, Kevin Cook, about NVIDIA NVDA, arguably the most important company in the world right now, and some ETFs that investors could use to capitalize on its earnings.\n\nThe AI chip giant is set to report its earnings on March 22, and analysts are racing to raise their price targets ahead of the much-anticipated event.\n\nAt its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in March, NVIDIA launched its next generation of AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang said that these significantly outperform the H100 systems that power generative AI services like ChatGPT. Read: Bull of the Day: NVIDIA NVDA\n\nThanks to the surge in demand for its AI chips, NVIDIA's shares have risen more than 90% this year, following a nearly 240% increase in 2023. However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, as earnings are growing faster than its share price.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at about 38 times expected earnings, below its five-year median and those of many other chip stocks, including AMD AMD.\n\nNVIDIA currently controls over 80% of the market for cutting-edge chips used to train and run large language models that underpin generative AI.\n\nThe largest tech companies, including Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META, currently account for more than 40% of NVIDIA's revenues.\n\nWhile NVIDIA’s GPUs are unmatched for training AI models, chips from other companies like Intel INTC and AMD can be used for inference after models are trained.\n\nNVIDIA also appears to have a dominant position in the inference market, but it could face competition in the coming years. Additionally, large technology companies are designing their own chips, which could reduce their reliance on NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA’s meteoric surge has drawn some investors to single-stock ETFs that aim to double its daily return. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL has about $2 billion in assets, and the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX has gathered about $360 million.\n\nI think these instruments can be effectively used as short-term tactical trading tools before or after earnings. However, investors should remember that these products are not meant for buy-and-hold investing and should be used only by those who closely monitor their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nTune in to the podcast to learn more.\n\nMake sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of the ETF Spotlight and remember to subscribe!

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said its partnership with Dell Technologies Inc. will spread artificial intelligence to a wider range of customers, helping businesses and organizations create their own “AI factories.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash Site Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’ One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy\n\n“We want to bring this generative AI capability to every company in the world,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Las Vegas, where Dell is holding a conference. “It’s not about just delivering a box — it’s about delivering an entire infrastructure. It’s an infrastructure that’s insanely complicated.”\n\nDell is one of the largest providers of computing infrastructure to government agencies and businesses — a market that Nvidia doesn’t directly serve. Though Nvidia’s sales have surged in the past year, it has mostly relied on a small group of customers for that growth: the data center operators known as hyperscalers. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are its biggest customers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg — though Dell is close behind.\n\nNvidia’s expansion plan hinges on getting agencies and businesses to develop their own AI capabilities, spurring demand for its products. For that, they’ll need the storage, networking and computing supplied by Dell, Huang said. That’s why it’s an essential partner, he said.\n\nThe CEO is pushing Nvidia deeper into software tools, computer design and AI models, helping spread the company’s technology into everything from drug discovery to shipbuilding. Nvidia has succeeded because it prepared for the shift toward AI and has out-innovated all of its competitors, said Michael Dell, who also spoke on Bloomberg Television.\n\nNvidia’s stock, up more than 90% this year, rose 2.8% to $951.07 in New York trading on Monday. Dell, which also has rallied about 90% this year, was down 2.3% at $146.06.\n\nNvidia — the most valuable tech company after Microsoft and Apple Inc. — is slated to report its latest earnings on Wednesday. Analysts estimate that sales grew 243% last quarter. The company’s revenue has grown so quickly that Nvidia now makes nearly as much in a quarter as it did annually just two years ago.\n\nDell, a top maker of personal computers, unveiled a new line of PCs on Monday that are optimized for AI tasks. Nvidia, meanwhile, is the biggest seller of so-called AI accelerators — the processors that are key to development of chatbots and other cutting-edge tools.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia currently sells graphics chips for PCs, but not the central processing units, or CPUs. Huang declined to say whether the company will ultimately produce the CPU itself, a move that would put it in direct competition with Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.\n\nBefore Huang could discuss a potential move into that area, Michael Dell interrupted and said, “Come back next year.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "NVIDIA Earnings Loom: A Closer Look",
        "content": "The Q1 earnings cycle has turned out better than feared, with growth showing an acceleration relative to other periods. The technology sector has undoubtedly contributed its share of weight, helping brighten the overall picture notably.\n\nWith the period winding down, most market participants have shifted their attention to one company that has yet to report, namely Nvidia NVDA.\n\nWe’ve all become highly familiar with the stock over the last year, with excitement stemming from AI fueling an unbelievable run among shares. But how do expectations stack up heading into the release?\n\nLet’s take a closer look at a few key metrics to watch and recent analyst revisions.\n\nHeadline Expectations\n\nReflecting the optimism surrounding the company, analysts have positively revised their earnings expectations for the release, with the $5.48 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate overall up 11% since the end of February and suggesting 400% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRevenue expectations have unsurprisingly been taken higher as well, with the $24.3 billion Zacks Consensus Sales estimate up 7% over the same timeframe and reflecting a 240% climb from the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AI-fueled growth boom can be visually seen in the chart below, which illustrates NVDA’s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Metrics\n\nNvidia’s Data Center results will, of course, be the main attraction within the quarterly print, encompassing sales of its AI chips. For the upcoming quarter, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Data Center revenue stands at $20.7 billion, 380% higher than the year-ago mark.\n\nNvidia’s Data Center sales have consistently surpassed our consensus expectations recently, with the most recent beat totaling more than $1.4 billion. Impressively, the $20.7 billion expected would reflect yet again another quarterly record for the company.\n\nIt’s clear that the demand Nvidia has been witnessing has been astonishing, further underpinned by robust expectations. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, the company’s Gaming revenue will also be an area that market participants will tune into, which has shown a nice growth rebound over the last few periods. Growth looks set to continue, with the current $2.6 billion Zacks Consensus estimate suggesting a 17% year-over-year climb.\n\nNvidia has exceeded our consensus Gaming revenue estimate in six consecutive quarters, reflecting a solid turnaround from the post-pandemic demand crater. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia NVDA has been in a league of its own over the last year, consistently surprising the market in a big way thanks to unrelenting demand for AI applications.\n\nShares are heading into the report in a positive light, underpinned by favorable top and bottom line expectations that have enjoyed upward revisions.\n\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with expectations trending higher across the board.

(NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to reveal new hardware and software for consumer devices at an event on its Redmond, Washington campus on Monday.\n\nReuters reported that the announcement will include new versions of the Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, both of which will feature Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) chips based on Arm Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:ARM) architecture.\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips, equipped with a neural processing unit, will power the new devices, enhancing AI-focused applications like Microsoft’s Copilot software.\n\nThis move marks a significant shift from Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), whose processors have long dominated the PC market, towards lower-power Arm components vying for a share in Windows PCs.\n\nThis showcase comes just a day before Microsoft’s annual developer conference. Microsoft aims to solidify its position in the burgeoning market for consumer-friendly AI tools, a field in which it gained an early lead through its partnership with OpenAI.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft Unveils AMD-Powered AI Chips To Rival Nvidia: Report\n\nOpenAI and Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "The AI Stock Underdogs: 7 Underappreciated Companies Poised for Greatness",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has taken over business headlines for good reason. Yet, investors may be better served, at this juncture, focusing on underappreciated AI stocks. Why? Primarily, it comes down to the impact of a crowded trade.\n\nYes, you can pile your funds into the usual suspects such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the market never sees assets rise in perfectly linear fashion indefinitely because it’s difficult to sustain rising expectations. That’s especially the case for Nvidia. With so many blistering earnings performances, at some point, it will miss.\n\nWe don’t know when that miss will occur. So, it’s a financial game of Russian roulette.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the other hand, hidden gems in the AI space could have longer legs, mainly because so few expect them to do anything. By opening the doors to non-tech enterprises, investors may be able to enjoy surprising profits. With that, below are underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), chances are, AI isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. However, it’s a clear beneficiary of digital intelligence. For example, the big-box retailer has started incorporating conversation AI into its business. With its voice shopping interface, customers can shop as fast as they can talk and text.\n\nFinancially, it’s a consistent performer, allowing investors the ability to sleep easy at night. In the four quarters since the period ending April 30, 2024, Walmart’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 7.88%. It’s not an astounding print but it gets the job done.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are looking at earnings per share of $2.38 on revenue of $674.53 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $2.22 on sales of $648.12 billion. In the following year, these metrics could improve to earnings of $2.61 per share on sales of $700.54 billion.\n\nWhile it’s not exciting, the reliability factor makes WMT one of the underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food giant McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) isn’t exactly a technology player. However, it’s one of the underappreciated AI stocks thanks to the underlying deployment of the innovation. Last year, the Golden Arches made news when it opened a new automated restaurant in Texas. Rather than the traditional means of picking up orders, customers can take advantage of a conveyer-belt-fed system.\n\nOn a financial note, McDonald’s is very appealing because of its consistency. Yes, in the first quarter of 2024, the company incurred a small miss regarding its bottom-line target. However, in the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.93%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate EPS of $12.20 on sales of $26.62 billion. That’s a sizable improvement over last year’s results of $11.15 EPS on revenue of $23.82 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 could see the bottom line rise to $13.28 per share with a top line of $28.14 billion. With a decent forward dividend yield of 2.45%, MCD ranks among the underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) makes sense in any context because of a cynical reality: people must eat. But KR is also one of the underappreciated AI stocks. Not too long ago, the company announced AI capabilities to its online marketplace. This new interface should give Kroger customers a superior experience via more informative product listings.\n\nOn a financial level, a key reason for investing in KR stock is the underlying consistency. In the past four quarters since the period ending Jan. 31, 2024, the grocer’s positive average earnings surprise clocked in at 7.98%. On a trailing-12-month basis, Kroger features a net income of $2.15 billion. Its profit margin comes in at 1.44%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are seeking EPS of $4.42 on revenue of $148.73 billion. That’s a downgrade from last year’s results of $4.76 EPS on sales of $150.04 billion. However, there could be a gradual improvement to earnings of $4.55 per share on sales of $151.36 billion in the following year.\n\nDeere (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most important companies due to its relevance to the agriculture industry, Deere (NYSE:DE) also ranks among underappreciated AI stocks. A key innovation that the company forwarded is its autonomous tractor. First, such autonomy may offer force multiplication for farmers. Second, because fewer people are interested in a farming career, these smart tractors could address sector labor shortages.\n\nFor investors, DE stock has attracted demand due to the pertinence to a critical ecosystem. Also, it’s a consistent performer. Since fiscal Q1, Deere’s average positive earnings surprise came out to just under 16%. That’s mighty impressive. Also, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 1.48%.\n\nMoving forward, analysts anticipate a tricky narrative, with EPS coming down to $26.81 on sales of $48.08 billion by the end of this year. That compares disappointingly to 2023’s print of $34.69 EPS on revenue of $55.56 billion. Still, with the consistently robust performances recently, it wouldn’t be shocking to see Deere prove doubters wrong again.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA healthcare juggernaut, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the most trusted investments for the long haul. It also happens to be one of the underappreciated AI stocks. Notably, the company earned a spot in Fast Company’s 2022 “Most Innovative Companies” list. One featured innovation was J&J’s AI-powered C-SATS platform, which allows surgeons to connect any operating room to the cloud.\n\nAside from a small miss in Q2 2023, the healthcare giant has been consistent with its earnings performances. In the past four quarters, its average positive surprise came out to 1.6%. It’s not the most exciting enterprise, that much is certain. However, the focus on building the bottom line allows the company to offer a forward dividend yield of 3.21%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS to rise to $10.65 on sales of $88.35 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $9.92 on revenue of $85.16 billion. In fiscal 2025, these metrics could improve to earnings of $10.95 per share with a top line of $90.74 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cybersecurity specialist, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) happens to be a great example of underappreciated AI stocks. Primarily, the focus of digital intelligence centers on “accretive” endeavors; that is, directives that enhance productivity. At the same time, AI could be a force multiplier for nefarious online activities. Therefore, Palo Alto’s AI-focused cybersecurity protocol is a necessity in keeping enterprises safe from harm.\n\nNot surprisingly, the company benefits from robustly consistent performances. In the past four quarters since the period ending Jan. 31, Palo Alto’s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 15.53%. On a TTM basis, net income stands at $2.28 billion. Its profit margin is a stout 30.24%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that EPS will rise to $5.51 on sales of $7.98 billion. That’s a big step from last year’s results of earnings of $4.44 per share on revenue of $6.89 billion. For fiscal 2025, EPS of $6.16 with a top line of $9.13 billion may be in the cards. Therefore, it’s one of the underappreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA software firm, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is best known for its TurboTax program. That’s going to be significant moving forward as the gig economy may attract workers. If so, people will transition from being employees to independent contractors and that imposes a more complex tax structure. Invariably, those new to working for themselves will have questions. Here, generative AI can help.\n\nAs an investment, INTU stock is attractive for consistently (and handily) beating its quarterly bottom-line targets. In the past four quarters, Intuit’s average positive earnings surprise came out to 14.9%. On a TTM basis, its net income stand at $2.77 billion. Further, its profit margin clocks in at 18.35%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS of $16.41 on sales of $16.05 billion. Last year, the company posted earnings of $14.40 per share on revenue of $14.37 billion. In fiscal 2025, these metrics could improve to $18.85 EPS with a top line of $18.05 billion. With a potentially expanding total addressable market, Intuit makes for one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy for a Sizzling Summer",
        "content": "If you’re looking for a profitable summer, then growth stocks should be No. 1 on your priority list. Identifying the best growth stocks to buy – with the help of tools like the Portfolio Grader – is a great first step in your investing journey.\n\nGrowth stocks represent companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to others in the market. Investors can expect these companies to reinvest their earnings back into the business – so there are rarely dividends to speak of – because the No. 1 priority of these companies is to expand, innovate, or scale up operations.\n\nThey are the opposite of value stocks, which are often mature companies with stable earnings and dividends. And while the best value stocks are priced below their fundamentals, top growth stocks often have high price-to-earnings, price-to sales, or price-to-book ratios. But that’s the trade-off when you’re looking for the best growth stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the stock market often experiences its weakest point in the summer, there’s no reason to avoid investing. In fact, I believe these growth stocks to buy will help you beat the market and make for a profitable summer investing season.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the best growth stocks to buy for months now, and that’s not going to end anytime soon. The semiconductor company is on a massive run as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are in high demand for their ability to operate generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe most recent win for Nvidia is its new deal with Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), in which the aerospace and defense company will use Nvidia’s AI platform and generative AI software.\n\nNvidia owns roughly 80% of the AI chip market, putting it in a dominant position for years to come. NVDA stock is up 90% this year and is in a position to hit $1,000 per share after it reports earnings on May 22. It gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) isn’t anywhere as big as Nvidia. But it’s still a dynamic growth company that’s using the power of artificial intelligence to see massive gains.\n\nPalantir long made its mark as a defense contractor, using AI and machine learning to provide real-time analysis and predictions to military units in the field.\n\nBut it’s also quickly growing its commercial business through its Artificial Intelligence Platform and its Gotham platform. An important partnership with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will make those products available through Oracle’s cloud network.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Palantir stock pulled back following its first-quarter earnings report, I see good things ahead for this company.\n\nEarnings were for $634.3 million in revenue, up 21% from a year ago. Palantir projects revenue in the range of $649 million to $653 million for the second quarter and raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $2.677 billion and $2.689 billion.\n\nPLTR stock is up 26% this year and up 128% in the last 12 months. It gets a “B” rating for growth and an overall rating of “A” in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is riding AI headwinds to become the biggest company in the world – with a market capitalization of $3 billion, Microsoft is king of the hill for publicly traded companies.\n\nThe software company makes and distributes some of the most well-known products in the world, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Microsoft Teams.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 suite is a must-have product for businesses and personal computer users around the world.\n\nMicrosoft also has an important relationship with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. By investing $13 billion into the company over the years, Microsoft has been in the position of being the first to incorporate the ChatGPT generative AI into its Bing search engine, its Edge browser, and into Microsoft 365 products.\n\nMicrosoft has nicely recovered from its recent dip and the stock is up 11% so far this year. It gets “B” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) a Google Pixel smartphone\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another powerhouse in its own right. With its dominant Google search engine, Chrome browser, and products such as YouTube, Alphabet is in dominant force for both advertisers and content producers.\n\nThe company earned $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 – an extraordinary figure – with $46.1 billion of that coming from Google search advertising.\n\nRevenue was 15% better than last year, with solid year-over-year growth for YouTube advertising and Google search.\n\nThere are some bearish takes that OpenAI, which is the company that brought ChatGPT to life, could roll out a new AI-powered search engine as part of its partnership with Microsoft and that company’s Bing search engine.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has denied there’s an imminent announcement, but rumors persist and it’s having an effect on GOOG shares.\n\nMy advice? Take advantage of the dip should shares of GOOG stock continue to fall. It could be a great opportunity.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re bullish about the growth of computing and AI – and why wouldn’t you be? – then another growth stock to consider closely is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI).\n\nAfter a huge run in 2023 and early 2024, Supermicro stock has pulled back somewhat, but that looks more like a buying opportunity than anything.\n\nIts earnings report was impressive – sales tripled from a year ago and earnings per share were up fourfold. Supermicro also increased its guidance from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion previously, to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion currently.\n\nBut bearish investors ruled the day and SCMI stock dropped 23% following the earnings report.\n\nBut the thesis about Super Micro Computer hasn’t changed. The company will continue to work closely with chip manufacturers like Nvidia to design server architecture to bundle powerful AI chips so they can perform complex tasks.\n\nSMCI stock is up 218% this year, and continues to get “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the social media company that’s behind Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also made waves in recent years by investing billions into the metaverse, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg hopes the future of computing and our online worlds lie.\n\nWhile I don’t share Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for the metaverse, I can’t help but be impressed with Meta for the staying power of its core products. Meta’s platforms count nearly half of the global population – almost 4 billion people – as monthly average users. That’s extraordinary.\n\nAnd the company’s reach and the detailed information it has on its users – thanks to their users’ profiles and postings – allows Meta to be highly specific in targeting advertising to people who are most likely to buy. If you’re an advertiser, you’re probably very familiar with Meta’s advertising platform.\n\nMETA stock is up 33% in 2024. It gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a very interesting and innovative company. It has a variety of voice recognition products – powered by artificial intelligence – that allow customers to do everything from asking questions about their vehicle maintenance to providing step-by-step training for employees.\n\nEven Nvidia is taking notice. The chipmaker took a stake of its own in the company, and as investors took notice, SOUN stock soared. At one point, shares of SoundHound were up more than 300% this year.\n\nSoundHound reported a strong quarter, with auto units and cloud users expanding by double digits. Revenue was $11.6 million, up 73% from a year ago. The company continued to post losses as it scales, with a net loss of $19.9 million or 7 cents per share.\n\nSOUN stock is up 141% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR, and MSFT.

        "title": "History Says an Nvidia Stock-Split Announcement Might Be Coming on May 22",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has risen to become a nearly $1,000 stock again, which is usually a threshold where investors start to expect a stock split. While there's no hard and fast rule about when to expect a split (some companies never do), history tells us that Nvidia could be considering one now.\n\nAdditionally, May 22 may be the day that one is announced, which is right around the corner. The last time Nvidia announced a stock split, the stock went wild and rose significantly. So, should you buy ahead of this potential announcement?\n\nThe last stock split was announced at a similar time in 2021\n\nThe last time Nvidia enacted a stock split was on July 20, 2021. That four-for-one split broke each Nvidia share into four separate pieces, thus increasing the share count fourfold and cutting the stock price to 25% of its original value. Without this split, Nvidia's stock would be around $3,600 today.\n\nHowever, the timing of this last split announcement sets the stage for a potential announcement on May 22 during its first-quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings release. In its Q1 fiscal year 2022 earnings release (which occurred on May 26, 2021), Nvidia announced to shareholders that the board of directors agreed to split the stock. This is perfect timing, as the annual meeting of stockholders was set to occur only a few weeks later so that shareholders could approve the vote. At that time, Nvidia was trading at around $600, so the stock is far more expensive today than when it decided to split its stock.\n\nWith the stage set for nearly the same scenario three years later, I would not be surprised if Nvidia announced a stock split on May 22. The question is, will it ignite a run-up like it did last time? After Nvidia's Q1 results were announced, up until the stock split date, the stock went on an impressive tear. NVDA Chart\n\nWith the stock rising 30% in the days after the stock-split announcement, who wouldn't want to get ahead of that movement? However, investors should not expect that kind of reaction again.\n\nShould Nvidia's stock increase by 30% from current levels, its market cap would increase from $2.3 trillion to roughly $3 trillion. That would allow Nvidia to surpass Apple as the second-largest company in the world and put it within striking distance of Microsoft as the largest company in the world.\n\nI doubt that a stock-split announcement will create nearly $700 billion in value. Fortunately, there are other reasons to buy the stock.\n\nNvidia's growing business is driving the stock price higher\n\nWhile the threshold where companies split their stocks differs for each business, the reason remains the same: Their stock price has gotten too expensive. This occurs because the business is succeeding -- a great problem to have.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's business has been on fire lately, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) selling at an unbelievable pace to satisfy the demand for data centers built to power the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race.\n\nAny stock movement from a potential stock-split announcement should be attributed to its GPU business, as it's the driving force behind the stock. With management guiding investors for Q1 revenue of about $24 billion (indicating 234% growth), we're slated to see a monster quarter reported again.\n\nWhile a stock-split announcement may be coming, investors should look beyond that to determine if Nvidia is a potential buy (or not).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites- 7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks is always a good idea. They might not show an immediate upside but do have the potential to navigate through the market turmoil and come out strong. However, not all stocks are made the same and you need a careful eye to figure out the best blue-chip stocks to buy. The economy is finally improving and the S&P 500 breached 5,300 for the first time after a cooler-than-expected inflation report.\n\nA rate cut could be on the way and if you want to rebalance your portfolio with blue-chip stocks that have strong buy ratings, now is the right time to do so. These stocks have proved their strength in the industry and recently reported impressive quarterly numbers. Several analysts have strong buy ratings making them hot picks right now. Let’s dive deep into them.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top blue-chip stock, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a strong buy rating from a total of 41 analysts. Currently trading for $183 and up 22% year-to-date, the stock has a price target of $220, a 19% upside potential. The e-commerce giant reported strong fundamentals driven by its cloud segment Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the thriving advertising segment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnalysts were impressed with the first-quarter results and are expecting higher advertising and cloud computing revenue in the coming quarters. The company has been using artificial intelligence for a long time now and the management expects the demand for AI to boost the cloud computing revenue throughout the year.\n\nIt has also invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic which is the maker of Calude 3, a ChatGPT competitor. Besides the cloud segment, Amazon’s e-commerce business continues to dominate the industry. Its future is bright and the company has a solid track record of performance. No wonder analysts love the stock!\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in the AI industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is already wearing the crown but there is a lot more to come. With the growing adoption of AI in industries, the demand for AI chips will be on the rise and this is where Nvidia will continue to benefit. The company is holding the largest market share and no competitor has been able to come close to it.\n\n40 analysts have a strong buy rating for the stock with a price target of $1,026, an 8% upside from the current level. Industry experts believe that the stock will rally after the company announces results on May 22 and recommend buying before the earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock is trading at $943 today and is up 95% YTD. The stock hasn’t been able to hit $1,000 but I believe the upcoming results will give it a boost. Nvidia is the biggest provider of chips for large-language models used for AI chatbots. The AI market is only going to expand and Nvidia will be the first one to benefit.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 36% YTD, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is exchanging hands for $473 and the stock has a strong buy rating from 36 analysts. The stock has an average price target of $522, up 10% from the current level.\n\nMeta reported strong fundamentals with an EPS of $4.71 and a net income of $12.37 billion, more than double from the same period prior year. The revenue came in at $36.46 billion. Analysts believe that the fundamentals and the outlook both are positive and Meta has the ability to deliver.\n\nThe company’s financial results have improved significantly over the past few quarters. It has implemented generative AI features that meet the needs of advertisers and ensure higher views and conversions.\n\nMeta’s revenue is driven by the growing advertising revenue and this segment is set to expand throughout 2024. The company also has enough liquidity to keep investing in AI which will reap rewards in the years to come.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech giant Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the best stocks to buy and hold for the long term. A highly resilient company, Visa hasn’t disappointed even in times of high inflation and high interest rates.\n\nTrading at $279, the stock is up 8% YTD and has shown volatility over the past month due to the mixed inflation reports. 20 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $315, a 12% upside from the current level.\n\nThere are several reasons to bet on Visa stock. It caters to over 100 million merchants and takes a fee from every transaction made using a Visa card. This ensures steady revenue and keeps the operating costs down. As we transition towards a digital economy, Visa is set to benefit.\n\nIts quarterly results were impressive with a revenue of $8.8 billion, up 10% YTD, and the total processed transactions stood at 55.5 billion, up 11%. Visa is in an excellent position today and it has the ability to expand its market share as card usage increases.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one stock that will never disappoint you. Having reported impressive numbers, the company proved its domination in the cloud segment. Its Azure revenue increased 31% YOY. The company is investing heavily in AI and has already started seeing results.\n\nMicrosoft is constantly evolving and did not waste any time before investing in OpenAI and integrating AI in its products and services. It has introduced Copilot which has already become a huge success and recently launched the Copilot for Security.\n\nExchanging hands for $420 today, the stock is up 13% YTD and has increased 34% in the past 12 months. It is also a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 0.71%. 31 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $491, showing a potential upside of 16%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nTrading at $175, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) stock looks undervalued to me. The stock is up 25% YTD and 44% in the past 12 months. It is trading much lower than its competitors Microsoft and Amazon but has a lot of potential to move higher.\n\nAlphabet’s quarterly results were very impressive with a 15% jump in revenue to reach $80.5 billion and the net income stood at $1.89 per share. One thing to keep in mind is that Google will never be dethroned.\n\nIt is hard to imagine our lives without Google and even if competitors make similar products, they will not be able to replace the company. It holds the top position in internet search and has shown steady revenue growth in the cloud segment.\n\nOn Tipranks, 32 analysts have a buy rating for the stock with an average price target of $195, a 12% upside from here. The company declared its first-ever dividend this quarter and I think it is the beginning of something that will last long.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\n12 analysts on Tipranks have a buy rating for Chevron (NYSE:CVX) with an average price target of $188, offering a 16% upside. As of writing, CVX stock is trading for $161 and is up 7% YTD.\n\nThe oil and gas giant is a cash-generating machine and it has reported impressive financials due to the soaring oil prices. Mizuho has a price target of $205 for the stock which is a 27% upside from the current level.\n\nThe demand for combustion-powered vehicles will continue to grow even if we take small steps towards electrification. This will work in favor of Chevron as the production unit will expand.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it reported earnings of $5.5 billion and a 12% rise in production YOY. Crude oil was trading at $80 per barrel and this means Chevron is set to benefit. Even if the price drops, Chevron has enough liquidity to keep going.\n\nIt is a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 4.05%. Analysts are expecting a strong improvement in fundamentals this year as compared to the previous year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Cheap Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "If you’re searching for cheap quantum computing stocks to invest in for early next year, there are a few companies worth watching. I expect these companies to perform well throughout 2024 due to their continued development and the gradual roll-out of their development road maps.\n\nQuantum computing companies are set to disrupt numerous industries with their technologies, ranging from healthcare to economic research and everything in between. The enormous leap in processing power will allow us to model previously impossible processes in classical computing.\n\nAs a result, there has been heavy interest from institutional investors in the space, and an arms race between companies to release the first commercialized quantum system is underway.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let’s dive in and discover the most promising affordable quantum computing stocks for 2024 and beyond. I think that these companies are bargains at their current levels that shouldn’t be ignored for too long by investors.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) specializes in quantum computing, providing systems across major cloud services. Despite being in a developmental stage with minimal revenue, it’s a pioneer as the first pure-play quantum computing company to go public.\n\nIn the first quarter, IONQ achieved $7.58 million in revenue, marking a 77% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. Despite the revenue growth, the company recorded a net loss of $39.6 million, which widened by 45% from the previous year.\n\nFor the full year of 2024, IONQ has raised its bookings guidance to between $75 million and $95 million, signaling confidence in its sales pipeline and business expansion.\n\nDespite this, I still feel that IONQ is undervalued, as it trades for just $8.71 at the time of writing. It also has far lower valuation ratios than many of the FAANG, big tech stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), thus making it one of those firms to consider.\n\nQuantum Computing Inc. (QUBT)\n\nSource: Bartlomiej K. Wroblewski / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) focuses on both quantum software and hardware, with notable products like the Qatalyst software and quantum processing units. Its acquisition of QPhoton enhances its capabilities, aiming at practical applications across various sectors including finance and healthcare.\n\nThey’ve been particularly active in expanding their offerings, such as the introduction of the Dirac-3 entropy quantum computer, which is designed for complex optimization tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the factors making QUBT’s offerings potentially appealing in terms of cost is their focus on creating quantum solutions that are both accessible and affordable. Their products are designed to operate at room temperature and consume low power, which reduces operational costs. These characteristics are intended to make their technology more practical and feasible for broader applications.\n\nAs of the end of September 2023, the company reported total liabilities of approximately $8.1 million, a decrease from the previous year. This reduction was primarily driven by regular debt repayments and a significant decrease in expenses. This then makes it one of those cheap quantum computing stocks by book value.\n\nRigetti Computing (RGTI) conceptual illustration representing quantum computing\n\nSource: ArtemisDiana / Shutterstock.com\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) is known for its development and production of quantum integrated circuits and a dedicated cloud platform for quantum algorithms.\n\nTheir strategy includes expanding their technological capabilities and securing strategic partnerships with major organizations like NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy to advance quantum computing.\n\nFor 2024, Rigetti’s financial performance shows they are navigating a challenging phase, with a reported revenue of $3.05 million for the first quarter and an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.14, missing the expected -$0.08 EPS by $0.06. This follows a pattern from the previous year, where their quarterly earnings consistently fell short of expectations.\n\nKey valuation ratios for Rigetti include a Price/Sales (PS) ratio of 15.37 and a Price/Book (PB) ratio of 1.71. The forward PS is projected at 11.11. This then prices it favorably compared to many of its peers, and signals that it could be undervalued and therefore cheap.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), traditionally known for its GPUs, is also involved in quantum computing, particularly through its simulation platforms that facilitate quantum computing research and development.\n\nNVDA has developed the CUDA-Q platform, an open-source, QPU-agnostic quantum-classical accelerated computing framework. This platform is instrumental in integrating quantum computing units (QPUs) with classical computing systems like GPUs.\n\nRecently, Nvidia announced the acceleration of quantum computing capabilities globally through their CUDA-Q platform, highlighting its deployment in Japan’s ABCI-Q supercomputer. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to boost national quantum computing efforts.\n\nAlthough NVDA’s valuation ratios are high, this could be seen as fairly priced or even undervalued when compared to its growth potential. It’s also one of the few stocks that have numerous growth drivers that could spur share price appreciation: from quantum, to blockchain, to semiconductors and of course gaming.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a major player in quantum computing, offering cloud-based quantum computing services and continuous advancements in quantum hardware and software. IBM Q System One is notable for its integration into the quantum industry.\n\nIBM could be a pick for a cautious investor due to its historically low beta, dividend growth rate and yield, and stable history.\n\nA notable development in IBM’s quantum development is their Qiskit platform, which is central to their strategy. Qiskit aids users in leveraging IBM’s quantum systems more effectively by simplifying the programming of quantum circuits and integrating quantum computations with classical processes.\n\nIBM’s efforts are also supported by its extensive quantum network, involving collaborations with universities, research labs, and industry leaders worldwide to advance quantum computing applications.\n\nIBM’s stock price is not cheap at $168 per share at the time of writing, and it has less aggressive growth prospects than others. Still, it may be worth considering for investors who want a less-risky foray into the world of quantum computing.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft quantum efforts include developing topological qubits and offering quantum computing services through Azure Quantum. Its holistic approach includes both hardware and software advancements in quantum technologies.\n\nA major focus has been on achieving reliable logical qubits, a critical step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. In partnership with Quantinuum, Microsoft has made a breakthrough by demonstrating logical qubits with error rates significantly lower than physical qubits.\n\nAzure Quantum, Microsoft’s cloud-based quantum computing platform, is a central part of their strategy. It offers tools and services that enable users to write, run, and manage quantum code directly in the cloud. It is also developing its own toolkit exclusively for future quantum developers called Q#, which I think will give it a significant leg up over its competitors.\n\nMSFT’s market cap at around 3 trillion makes it one of the most valuable in the world, so its valuation is not cheap on paper. However, I feel that it could be seen as undervalued when one takes its quantum progress into consideration and other growth headwinds such as AI through its partnership and investment into OpenAI.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet has made significant strides in quantum computing, claiming quantum supremacy in 2019. Its quantum computer, Sycamore, performed a calculation in minutes that would take traditional supercomputers much longer.\n\nAlphabet has made notable advancements in both hardware and software for quantum computing. It is working on scaling up its quantum computers, with ambitious plans to increase qubit numbers to 1 million by the end of the decade, aiming for an error-corrected, commercially viable quantum computer.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet has spun out its quantum technology efforts into an independent company called Sandbox AQ, which continues to work on applying quantum technology to enterprise use cases.\n\nJust with the other big FAANG stocks in the quantum space, Alphabet’s valuation remains high. One thing to keep in mind though is that its EPS is set to soar over the next few years, increasing by double digit amounts.\n\nAlphabet maintains an incredibly strong competitive moat with its Google and YouTube platforms, and its Gemini AI has shown promise in incorporating it into the search results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups.

        "title": "Stock Split Watch: Is Nvidia Next?",
        "content": "Ahead of Chipotle Mexican Grill's planned 50-for-1 stock split, investors may be wondering which stock could be next.\n\nOne candidate is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), whose stock has skyrocketed 230% over the past year and is now hovering around $950 per share. So, let's explore why a company might split its stock, Nvidia's history of stock splits, and whether investors should buy the chipmaker.\n\nWhat's a stock split?\n\nA stock split is a corporate action in which a company divides its existing shares into multiple shares, effectively increasing the outstanding shares while maintaining the same market capitalization. This results in its shareholders receiving more shares, while their ownership stake and the total value of their investment remain unchanged.\n\nFor instance, if an investor holds five shares of a company priced at $1,000 per share and the company executes a 10-for-1 stock split, the investor would then own 50 shares priced at $100 each, with the total investment value remaining at $5,000.\n\nWhy would a company split its stock?\n\nWhile many brokerages let retail investors purchase fractional shares, others, like Vanguard, don't offer this option. So, when a stock like Nvidia trades at a high price, it might become too expensive for many potential investors. Having a lower share price could make a stock more affordable, potentially leading to more demand for the company's shares, which may increase its overall market capitalization.\n\nAnother benefit is that a lower stock price can help attract and keep talented workers. Nvidia co-founder, president, and CEO Jensen Huang supports this reasoning, saying it provides workers greater flexibility in their ownership of company stock through compensation or stock plans.\n\nNvidia has split its stock before\n\nNvidia is no stranger to stock splits. Since going public in 1999, it has split its stock on five occasions, all under Huang. The company's most recent one, a 4-for-1 split, happened in July 2021.\n\nNotably, when the company announced its last stock split, its stock traded near $600 per share, well below its current price of $950 per share.\n\nWhen Jim Cramer asked about it in March, Huang said, \"We'll think about it,\" and reiterated why he likes the practice, saying: \"It's a good thing. We want to make sure we take care of our employees.\"\n\nIs Nvidia a buy ahead of a potential stock split?\n\nAlthough stock splits may spark interest, investors are advised to refrain from basing their investment decisions solely on this factor. Instead, the company's financial performance and management's guidance wield far greater influence on its long-term stock performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024, the company generated $60.9 billion in revenue and $29.8 billion in net income, an improvement of 126% and 581%, respectively, compared to its fiscal 2023. The meteoric rises were largely driven by the growing demand for its expensive H100 chip, which is the engine behind the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\nHuang summed up the unprecedented fiscal year by saying in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\"\n\nNvidia's management guided for roughly $24 billion in revenue for fiscal Q1 2025, which would represent a 234% year-over-year increase. Also, management projected its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin to be between 76.3% and 77%, resulting in a significant year-over-year increase from 64.6%. Anytime a company can increase its gross margin, it displays its pricing power, which Nvidia has in its industry-leading chips.\n\nNo matter how quickly a company is growing, investors still need to pay attention to valuation to ensure that they do not overpay for its stock. For a mature company like Nvidia, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a standard valuation metric that looks at a company's stock price compared to its trailing 12 months of earnings. As of this writing, Nvidia trades at 79.3 times trailing earnings, higher than its five-year median of 71.9. However, if you look at Nvidia's forward P/E ratio, which compares the stock price to the company's expected earnings over the next 12 months, its stock trades at a more reasonable 37.6. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhile value investors may scoff at Nvidia's valuation, considering the average trailing P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 23.2 times earnings, it's important to underscore that the unprecedented growth that Nvidia has seen in terms of sheer revenue and net income over the past year. For those reasons, coupled with the continued growth of generative artificial intelligence, long-term growth investors should consider buying or adding to Nvidia.

Also, net income fell to $266 million from $300 million in the same period last year. As a result, the company has revised its fiscal 2024 sales growth guidance downward and adjusted its EPS forecast to between $8.80 and $9.80.\n\nROK’s share is down 11.51% year-to-date (YTD) but up 69.11% over the past five years. Hence, this presents an attractive entry point.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the AI and robotics sectors, providing advanced AI chips and robotics solutions.

        "title": "Could This Be Nvidia's Next Growth Driver?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that are powering the crucial artificial intelligence (AI) tasks of training and inferencing. Thanks to the GPU's top speed, large language models (LLMs) process all of the data they need to go on do their job -- from offering us conversational assistants to streamlining a company's workflow.\n\nThough these chips play a key role in Nvidia's success, they aren't the only item this top tech company offers to potential customers. Nvidia actually sells a range of products and services to advance AI projects -- and one in particular is emerging as a potential winner. In fact, Nvidia, which already highlighted this business in its past earnings call, may offer us more details during this week's earnings report. Could it become the company's next growth driver? Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFrom video games to AI\n\nFirst a bit of background on Nvidia's path so far. For years, the company's biggest business was serving the video game industry -- but in more recent times, it became clear that the GPU's ability to simultaneously process tasks could be useful in other industries. Nvidia created the parallel computing platform CUDA to make that happen -- and what followed was an expansion into many areas, including AI.\n\nThese days, Nvidia's data center revenue far surpasses its video game revenue -- $18.4 billion vs $2.9 billion in the most recent quarter. Data center includes revenue from AI chips along with all other AI-related products and services. And this brings me to Nvidia's next potential growth driver: software.\n\nSoftware is essential for businesses to run AI applications, and accelerated computing involves a lot more complexity than general computing. The problem is each individual company launching an AI project doesn't have the extensive engineering team necessary to oversee software stacks across every cloud and on premises.\n\nThat's where Nvidia comes in. Chief executive officer Jensen Huang describes Nvidia AI Enterprise as sort of an operating system for AI. Through this platform, Nvidia manages customers' software stacks and \"containerizes\" them into the Nvidia stack. This business already has reached a $1 billion run rate, and it's in its early days. In fact, Huang predicts every enterprise software company launching software in any cloud or on premises will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise -- making it \"a very significant business over time.\"\n\nIs Jensen Huang too optimistic?\n\nSo, is Huang being too optimistic or could this really be a big growth driver for the company? It's important to remember that AI still is in its early days, meaning companies and organizations are just getting started when it comes to investing in AI and launching projects. So need for not only Nvidia's GPUs but also its AI Enterprise service should increase from this point.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia also has built a solid reputation as the go-to company if you're looking for premium GPUs -- and it's logical that many customers won't stop there but will instead sign on for this package that could make their AI experience more efficient and successful.\n\nAll of this means AI Enterprise could be Nvidia's next important growth driver, and investors should look for any details about progress in this area during the earnings report on Wednesday. Software growth could take time, though, as companies don't launch AI projects overnight -- instead, we may see a progressive increase in demand over the coming years.\n\nWhat does this mean for you as an investor? Nvidia has seen explosive growth in revenue and earnings in recent times, and I expect growth to continue thanks to the company's leadership and the general industry outlook. But I wouldn't be discouraged if growth ebbs and flows at certain points -- it's unlikely to see revenue soar at a higher and higher pace without any sort of pause.\n\nWhat's most important is Nvidia's range of products and services, including software, has what it takes to supercharge revenue over the long term as customers turn to this AI leader. All that means it's a great idea to buy and hold Nvidia stock to benefit from the next chapters of the AI story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street bets on stellar quarterly results from Nvidia",
        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Wall Street is betting on a blowout quarterly report from Nvidia on Wednesday, with its stock near record highs as investors look for evidence that the AI chipmaker can maintain its explosive growth and stay ahead of rivals.\n\nThe results will be the latest test for Wall Street's picks-and-shovels trade that has turned Nvidia into the biggest winner of the generative AI boom, thanks to its chips that are essential in powering technology such as Google's Gemini to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\n\"There is a lot riding on Nvidia's earnings. It is the most important stock in the sector,\" said Will Rhind, founder and CEO of GraniteShares, which runs an ETF that invests in the chip firm.\n\nA more than six-fold surge in its shares since the start of 2023 has made Nvidia Wall Street's third-most valuable firm, worth more than $2.30 trillion.\n\nIts 89% stock surge so far in 2024 has helped lift the broader market, and Nvidia now accounts for 5% of the S&P 500, according to LSEG data.\n\nAnalyst expectations for Nvidia's future earnings have climbed even faster than its shares. That last left the stock trading at about 35 times expected earnings, down from a peak of over 80 last June, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's staggering valuation might yet have room to grow. \"It is undervalued relative to where forecasts are going,\" Rhind said.\n\nAnalysts on average see Nvidia reporting a 242% jump in revenue to $24.60 billion for the fiscal quarter ending in April, according to LSEG data as of May 17. Its sales in the second quarter are expected to rise almost 97%, the data showed.\n\nAnalysts see it reporting net income of $12.83 billion in the first quarter, up from $2.04 billion a year ago.\n\nFor several quarters, demand for Nvidia's AI processors has outpaced the number of chips that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, its contract manufacturer, has been able to make.\n\n\"The only thing really holding Nvidia back right now is supply,\" said Inge Heydorn, a partner at investment firm G.P. Bullhound, which owns Nvidia shares.\n\nInvestors are also concerned about restrictions by Washington on exports of Nvidia's top-shelf AI chips to China.\n\nInvestors are awaiting updates on chips Nvidia is developing for the Chinese market after export curbs reduced its revenue share from China to about 9% of sales in the fourth quarter, from about 22% share in the third.\n\nAfter several quarters of three-fold growth in its revenue last year, Nvidia is also grappling with tough comparisons.\n\n\"As the numbers get bigger, you're up against the law of big numbers, and that percentage beat starts to become less and less,\" BNP Paribas Exane analyst David O'Connor said.\n\nStory continues\n\nRising prices of high-bandwidth memory chips used in its AI semiconductors could also dent margins at Nvidia, with analysts expecting adjusted gross margin of 75.8% in the second quarter, compared with expectations of about 77% in the first.\n\nGross margins might take a slight hit from \"memory costs going up and increasing,\" said G.P. Bullhound's Heydorn.\n\nOverall, analysts remain confident about Nvidia's growth as technology heavyweights from Microsoft to Meta Platforms boost spending on data centers by billions of dollars in the race for generative AI.\n\nGlobal spending on cloud infrastructure services is likelyto increase by 20% in 2024 compared with 18% in 2023, according to research firm Canalys.\n\n\"Capital expenditures from Big Tech remains high. Despite their efforts to explore alternative or in-house chips, their options are restricted by both limited supply capacity and the challenge of surpassing Nvidia's proven performance,\" said Ido Caspi, an analyst at Global X ETFs.\n\n\"We still view Nvidia as the industry leader for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Ginormous Gains? Here's an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock You Can Buy Right Now.",
        "content": "Shoulda, woulda, coulda. That could be the refrain for some investors who didn't own shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in recent years.\n\nNo company has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom as much as Nvidia. The demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) has exploded, causing Nvidia's share price to skyrocket.\n\nMissed out on Nvidia's ginormous gains? Don't worry. Here's an AI stock you can buy right now.\n\nThink smaller\n\nIt's possible that Nvidia could keep its momentum going at the frenetic pace we've seen over the last couple of years. However, I'd argue it's not probable for one simple reason: size. With Nvidia's market cap now hovering around $2.3 trillion, delivering a 3x or greater return is much more difficult. Investors seeking huge growth should think smaller, in my opinion.\n\nI think UiPath(NYSE: PATH) is exactly the kind of AI stock that anyone who missed out on Nvidia's meteoric rise should consider. The company sells enterprise automation and AI software. UiPath appears to be in a sweet spot with a market cap of roughly $11.6 billion. Of course, a smaller size doesn't necessarily mean that UiPath will be a big winner in the coming years. But I think it will.\n\nFor many of the most successful companies today, achieving profitability was an inflection point in their growth trajectory. UiPath recently recorded its first profitable quarter as a public company.\n\nBusiness is booming. UiPath's revenue in its quarter ending Jan. 31, 2024, soared 31% year over year to $405 million -- an all-time high. The company boasts a dollar-based net retention rate (a measure of recurring revenue from existing customers) of 119%. Its gross margin is nearly 90%.\n\nPutting AI to work\n\nIf AI merely provides entertaining chats and creates interesting images, it won't be a game changer. The real opportunity for AI (as with any new technology) is increasing productivity. UiPath's primary focus is putting AI to work.\n\nThe company's Test Suite product for application testing stands out as a great example of how UiPath uses AI to boost productivity. A recent study revealed that Test Suite customers realized average annualized benefits of over $4 million with a return on investment of 529% over three years and a payback on investment of only six months.\n\nArk Invest predicts the AI software market could grow to $14 trillion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 42%, fueled by huge productivity gains. I believe UiPath is in a strong position to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost importantly, UiPath has shown it can deliver the innovation required to stay atop the AI automation market. The company also has an impressive partner network, including Accenture, Deloitte, EY, pwc, and SAP. CEO Robert Enslin noted in the latest quarterly conference call that over 70% of UiPath's deals involve its partners.\n\nBetter than Nvidia?\n\nIs UiPath better than Nvidia? It depends on your perspective.\n\nNvidia is unquestionably the stronger company. The GPU maker dominates the AI chip market and will likely do so for a long time to come. However, I think investors who didn't profit from Nvidia's huge gains have a great opportunity to jump aboard another AI leader that's still in its early stages of growth with UiPath.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UiPath wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed above the key 40,000 level for the first time in history on Friday, rising 134.21 points, or 0.34%, to 40,003.59, after hitting an intraday high in the previous session.\n\nThe S&P 500 inched up 6.17 points, or 0.12%, to 5,303.27, while the Nasdaq Composite ended down 12.35 points, or 0.07%, at 16,685.97.\n\nThe week ended strong with the Dow up 1.2%, marking its fifth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 1.5% and 2.1% week-to-date, achieving their longest winning streak since February.\n\nThis weekly ascent propelled the three indexes into positive territory for the second quarter despite a tough start. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are now both up more than 11% in 2024, while the Dow has climbed more than 6% this year.\n\nFor the week ahead, key economic data releases include the existing home sales report on Wednesday, and the durable goods orders report along with the University of Michigan report on Friday.\n\nMoreover, the minutes from the May Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be released on Wednesday. Meanwhile, several Fed officials are set to speak throughout the week as well.\n\n“We expect the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index increased to 67.9 in the final May reading,” Goldman Sachs economists said in a Sunday note.\n\n“We estimate the report’s measure of long-term inflation expectations remained unchanged at 3.1%, somewhat above the recent trend, reflecting higher gasoline prices and the higher-than-expected price data reported in 2024,” they added.\n\nInvestors await Nvidia, Target earnings reports\n\nSo far, roughly 93% of the companies in the S&P 500 index have reported their latest earnings, with profits proving more resilient than expected.\n\nOverall earnings are up 5.3%, supported by 3.7% revenue growth. Initially, bottom-up estimates had predicted a 3.9% rise in earnings from the previous year. Eight of the 11 sectors are showing positive earnings growth, six of which have witnessed double-digit increases.\n\nAs earnings season winds down, 17 firms are slated to report results this week, followed by another nine the following week.\n\nBy far the most anticipated report for this week will be released by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with Wall Street expecting another strong display from the AI darling.\n\nOther prints that will be in the spotlight include Target, Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), among others.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nOppenheimer: “We remain positive on equities and continue to see fixed income securities as complimentary to stocks in providing portfolio diversification.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Some near term profit-taking in the day to day action of the market particularly in segments of the market that have had exceptional run-ups since last year into this year continues to appear to us quite normal.”\n\n“Such activity combined with a process of rebalancing and rotation into other segments of the stock market in our view can be healthy and should contribute to the broadening of the markets’ progress from last year through this year.”\n\n“Near term volatility could in our view continue to present opportunity for investors to “catch babies that get thrown out with the bath water” in periods of market down drafts as the market digests levels of uncertainty that are not uncommon to times of transition in monetary policy like these and in periods of rising geopolitical risk.”\n\nBTIG: “The SPX is coming off four straight up weeks to fresh all-time highs. There are some negative divergences suggesting some consolidation is likely, but clearly the trend remains firmly bullish. The negative momentum and breadth divergences are also accompanied by an increase in speculation as Thursday was the highest Nasdaq Composite volume on record, driven by sub-$1 stocks. The equity put/call ratio is also back to complacent levels.”\n\n“All of this suggests a shallow pause/pullback over coming weeks rather than something more long-lasting. The bigger story, in our view, is the recent breakouts in China and many commodities (gold, silver, copper, uranium, etc) as well as the related equities.\"\n\n“We think this 'great reflation' trade has more to go and would highlight energy stocks as particularly timely here after a multi-week pullback.”\n\nMorgan Stanley: “In the base case, we forecast a 19x P/E multiple on 12-month forward EPS (June 2026) of US$283, which equates to a 5,400 forward 12-month price target.”\n\n“Our 2024 and 2025 earnings growth forecasts (8% and 13%, respectively) assume healthy, mid- single-digit top-line growth in addition to margin expansion in both years as positive operating leverage resumes (particularly in 2025). Modest valuation compression (from ~20x to ~19x in the base case) as earnings adjust higher is typical in a mid-to-late-cycle backdrop (occurred in the mid-1990s, mid- 2000s, and 2018 most recently).”\n\n“Normalization in the market multiple is also a function of a higher risk premium (lower rates are a partial offset), which reflects uncertainty around a wider range of potential outcomes. On this front, our bull (6,350) and bear (4,200) cases represent ~20% upside and downside potential versus the current index level, respectively.”\n\nEvercore ISI: “With VIX low at 11.99 while SPX trades at a very lofty 23.5x LTM P/E, all eyes turn to NVDA. If results beat consensus expectations, the near term share price reaction will be more difficult to gauge, even as the long term productivity implications of the AI Revolution remain clear. A +/- 8% move priced by Options is complicated by a downtick in AI uptake, falling to 4.7% – a “kink in the curve” to EVR ISI’s base case of 25% AI adoption by year-end 2025.\"\n\n“One certain thing is that NVDA’s price reaction will have consequences for SPX as a whole. It always does.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures inch up with Fed minutes, Nvidia results on tap for the week\n\nShah Capital ends campaign against Novavax board after Sanofi deal\n\nView comments",

        "title": "U.S. futures inch higher, Nvidia to report this week - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge higher after the Dow ended trading on Friday above the 40,000 mark for the first time. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is due to headline this week's corporate earnings calendar, with the maker of artificial intelligence-optimized chips expected to report another quarter of surging revenues. Elsewhere, several Fed officials are set to speak on Monday, as investors attempt to gauge to road ahead for the central bank's monetary policy.\n\n1. Futures point higher\n\nU.S. stock futures were broadly higher on Monday, suggesting an extension in a rally in the prior session that drove the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average to its first-ever close above the 40,000 level.\n\nBy 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 19 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 4 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 22 points or 0.1%.\n\nRecent data indicating a possible cooling in the U.S. economy have alleviated some persistent inflation concerns, fueling hopes that the Federal Reserve will start to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs as soon as September. Along with the Dow, the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all touched record marks last week.\n\nThe durability of the strength on Wall Street will likely be tested by a fresh batch of corporate results this week, including quarterly returns from artificial intelligence darling Nvidia (see below). Durable goods and consumer sentiment data will also be in focus as markets hunt for more evidence that growth is moderating enough to give the Fed justification for rolling out rate cuts this year.\n\n2. Nvidia earnings ahead this week\n\nNvidia is set to highlight the earnings calendar this week, with traders keen to see if the maker of AI-specialized graphics processing units will once again post spiking revenues at its all-important data center unit.\n\nShares in the company have rocketed higher by nearly 92% this year, making it one of the focal points of the AI boom. In February, Nvidia said it expects revenues to jump to $24 billion in the first quarter, with Chief Executive Jensen Huang noting that he believed \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\"\n\nComments from Huang will also likely be in the spotlight. Nvidia faces competition from rival chipmakers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as supply chain constraints and geopolitical tensions that threaten AI chip exports from the U.S. to China. Meanwhile, major tech players like Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are reportedly beginning to build their own AI chips in-house, potentially limiting their need for Nvidia's chips.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Fed speakers, minutes on tap\n\nSeveral Fed officials are due to deliver speeches on Monday that may provide insight into the path ahead for the central bank's moentary policy.\n\nFed board members Christopher Waller, Philip Jefferson and Michael Barr are scheduled to speak at separate events.\n\nLater in the week, the Fed is set to publish the minutes from its April 30-May 1 meeting, when Chair Jerome Powell indicated that rates are likely to remain higher for longer because of lingering inflationary pressures.\n\nHowever, since then, data has shown that U.S. consumer prices -- a key gauge of inflation -- increased at a slower than anticipated pace in April, while a crucial labor market report undershot estimates.\n\nThe numbers bolstered wagers that the Fed will introduce two 25-basis point cuts to borrowing costs this year. Rates currently stand at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\n4. China keeps loan prime rate unchanged\n\nThe People’s Bank of China kept its benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged on Monday as widely expected, even as Beijing continued to roll out other stimulus measures to support the economy.\n\nThe PBOC maintained its one-year LPR at 3.45%, while the five-year rate, which is used to determine mortgage rates, was left at 3.95%.\n\nBoth rates were kept at record lows, as Beijing sought to shore up economic growth by keeping local monetary conditions as loose as possible.\n\nElsewhere, Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland Chinese property developers dropped despite Beijing announcing fresh measures last week aimed at supporting the ailing industry. China has unveiled a string of these policies in recent weeks, including a softening of home buying restrictions across several major cities and funds for local governments to buy real estate from developers.\n\n5. Crude gains amid Iran uncertainty\n\nCrude prices edged higher Monday, adding to the previous week’s gains, as uncertainty swirled around the political situation in the Middle East following the reported death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nBy 03:44 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% higher at $79.81 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $84.23 a barrel. Brent had ended the previous week up about 1%, its first weekly gain in three weeks, while WTI rose 2% on improved economic indicators from the U.S. and China, the world's largest oil consumers.\n\nIranian state media said Raisi, who was seen a possible successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash on Sunday in a remote region in the country's north-west.\n\nRaisi’s death comes amid simmering tensions in the oil-rich Middle East, with Israel and the militant group Hamas at war in Gaza. Israel and Iran also launched strikes against each other earlier this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures inch higher, Nvidia to report this week - what's moving markets\n\nJapan manufacturers want BOJ to keep yen stable, survey shows\n\nTop Japan companies agree to 5.58% average pay hike, business lobby says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Monday as markets welcomed stimulus measures in China, while technology-heavy indexes also advanced as investors bought into the sector ahead of key earnings this week.\n\nMost regional markets were sitting on gains from last week as some soft U.S. inflation readings ramped up hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. Wall Street hit record highs last week, with U.S. stock index futures rising further in Asian trade on Monday.\n\nFocus this week is also on more cues from the minutes of the Fed’s late-April meeting, as well as addresses from a slew of Fed officials.\n\nChinese stocks at 2024 peaks as markets weigh stimulus measures\n\nChina’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes rose 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, on Monday, extending gains from last week. Both indexes were at seven and eight-month highs.\n\nBeijing had rolled out a string of supportive measures for the economy- specifically the property market last week, as it moved to shore up a sluggish economic recovery.\n\nChina had loosened home buying restrictions across several major cities, and had also reportedly instructed state governments to begin buying up houses.\n\nChina also kept its benchmark loan prime rate at record lows on Monday.\n\nBut gains in Chinese markets were limited, especially after middling economic readings for April. Retail spending and capital investment in the country still remained weak, likely necessitating more stimulus measures from Beijing.\n\nFears of a renewed trade war with Washington also weighed, after Beijing banned some U.S. firms from importing and exporting activities related to China. The move was seen as potential retaliation for a recent increase in U.S. tariffs on key Chinese industries.\n\nTech advances with Nvidia earnings in sight\n\nTech-heavy indexes were among the better performers for the day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index added 1.3%, while South Korea’s KOSPI and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.\n\nInvestors bought into the sector ahead of quarterly earnings from artificial intelligence darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), due this Wednesday, for more cues on whether demand for the growing industry remained strong.\n\nNvidia is seen as a bellwether for the tech industry, especially given its growing exposure to the AI industry over the past year. The firm had effectively led an AI-driven spike in valuations across the tech sector.\n\nTech stocks were also sitting on some gains from last week after optimism over declining U.S. interest rates pushed down Treasury yields.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Asian markets also advanced. A rally in copper and other metal prices saw Australia’s ASX 200 rise 0.6% on strength in mining stocks.\n\nThailand’ SET Index rose 0.2% as gross domestic product data showed the economy grew much more than expected in the first quarter.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks rise on China stimulus cheer, tech strength\n\nUS futures drift higher as more earnings, economic cues loom\n\nAustralia's Star Entertainment gets potential deal offers\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Top AI chip supplier Nvidia reports fiscal first-quarter results Wednesday after the market closes, with Wall Street anticipating some deceleration following its earlier blockbuster growth.\n\nStill, for the quarter that ended in April, the numbers will be explosive as its chips remain in high demand for data centers used in generative artificial intelligence.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet see earnings per share soaring 474% to $5.22, with revenue up 241% to $24.5 billion. That would be down from the prior quarter's 765% earnings jump and 265% revenue surge.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock has leapt 87% so far in 2024 and is up about 200% from a year ago. Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world, boasting a market cap of $2.3 trillion that trails only Apple and Microsoft. But shares have essentially been flat over the last two months.\n\nNvidia’s unveiling in March of its new Blackwell chip has prompted some analysts to expect a slowdown during the transition from its older H100 chips to the next-generation models, which are expected to become publicly available later this year.\n\nIn a note on Thursday, analysts at Bank of America flagged this deceleration as a potential source of volatility in Nvidia stock after the earnings come out.\n\nWhile BofA sees Nvidia reporting strong numbers compared with the Wall Street consensus, analysts expect the company's second-quarter guidance to mark the first time sequential growth will be less than 10%.\n\nMeanwhile, it sees gross margins shrinking from about 77% in the first quarter to a \"more normalized\" range of 75%-76% in the following quarter.\n\n\"However, even if NVDA were to potentially deliver on these bullish expectations, the stock could still react unfavorably as bears will likely complain that: 1) NVDA QoQ sales growth will decelerate to 'only' 7-8% QoQ in FQ2 (Jul) outlook, well below the mid-teens or better the last few quarters, 2) [gross margin] peaking and decline is a sign of pricing pressure, unfavorable mix (more China H20 shipments and/or more inference units) and slowing demand/easing supply,\" the note said.\n\nFor its part, BofA is upbeat on Nvidia, giving the stock a \"buy\" rating and a price target of $1,100, which suggests upside of 19% from Friday's close.\n\nLast month, analysts at Morgan Stanley were also bullish on Nvidia, saying there were no signs of a pause in growth during the transition to the Blackwell chip with underlying demand still strong.\n\n“NVDA continues to see strong spending trends in AI, with upward revisions in demand from some of the newer customers such as Tesla and various sovereigns,” analysts wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd despite rising competition from Intel, Huawei, Samsung, and others, Morgan Stanley expects Nvidia to maintain its market share.\n\n“Blackwell generation pricing looks to make a strong competitive statement—reducing enthusiasm for competitive offerings,” it added.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Sunday after a series of record highs on Wall Street, with sentiment remaining cautiously optimistic ahead of more cues on interest rates and earnings this week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,334.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 18,661.50 points by 19:23 ET (23:23 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.1% to 40,179.0 points.\n\nMore Fed cues, PMI data on tap this week\n\nFocus this week is squarely on more cues from the Federal Reserve on the path of interest rates, with the minutes of the central bank’s late-April meeting due on Wednesday.\n\nThe bank had kept rates steady and warned that it needed more confidence that inflation was coming down. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell had also said that rates were eventually expected to come down in 2024.\n\nSeveral Fed officials are also set to speak this week, with particular focus on the members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n\nThe Fed cues come amid increased focus on the bank’s plans to cut interest rates, especially after slightly softer inflation readings for April pushed up bets for a September rate cut.\n\nBeyond more cues on interest rates, markets were also awaiting purchasing managers index data for May, which is set to offer more cues on U.S. business activity. Any signs of cooling could factor into the outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nWall St loses momentum after record highs\n\nWhile Wall Street indexes made new highs last week, they were still seen running out of momentum amid uncertainty over just when the Fed could begin trimming rates.\n\nOverheated valuations, particularly in the technology sector, and cooling hype over artificial intelligence also limited just how high indexes could push.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% on Friday to 5,303.27 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.1% to 16,685.97 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 40,003.59 points.\n\nNvidia Q1 earnings due this week\n\nFocus this week was also on quarterly earnings from AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), to see whether the firm could justify a massive increase in valuation over the past year.\n\nNvidia is also expected to clock a substantial increase in earnings, with revenue expected at $24.8 billion from $7.2 billion last year, while earnings per share are expected at $5.57 from $1.09 last year, according to Reuters estimates.\n\nNvidia’s earnings are also expected to likely determine the trajectory of other tech stocks, given their increasing exposure to AI.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures drift higher as more earnings, economic cues loom\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan and ASEAN plan joint strategy on auto production, Nikkei reports\n\nEarnings call: Sky Harbour Reports Positive Outlook in Q1 Earnings\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "Over the past year, many tech stocks rallied on the prospects of interest rate cuts. But with the Nasdaq now hovering near its all-time highs, it might seem like the right time to take profits in some of those stocks before the bears come back.\n\nThat's a prudent strategy, but I believe investors should still be adding more high-quality blue-chip tech stocks to their portfolios instead of hastily liquidating them. For me, these three stocks are still no-brainer buys in May: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia, the world's leading producer of discrete GPUs, has been one of the market's hottest growth stocks. Its shares have soared more than 560% over the past three years as the explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market has driven more companies to buy its high-end data center chips to process AI tasks.\n\nThat growth spurt initially surprised the bears. Back in fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023), its revenue growth flatlined as its adjusted EPS dropped 25%. That deceleration was caused by the PC market's post-pandemic decline and macro headwinds for the data center market. But in fiscal 2024, its revenue and adjusted EPS soared 126% and 288%, respectively, as the popularity of ChatGPT lit a raging fire under the generative AI market.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow another 84% and 93%, respectively, as the demand for new AI chips continues to outstrip available supply. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at 39 times forward earnings.\n\nNvidia's long-term growth could eventually be throttled by competition from AMD's cheaper data center GPUs, first-party chips at hyperscale cloud providers, and the tightening export curbs on its chip sales to China. But for now, it arguably remains the easiest way to profit from the secular expansion of the global AI market.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms -- the world's top social media company, which owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- saw its shares rally more than 50% over the past three years even as it weathered some tough challenges.\n\nIn 2022, Meta's revenue and EPS declined 1% and 38%, respectively. That slowdown was caused by Apple's privacy changes on iOS, intense competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and macro headwinds for the digital advertising market. At the same time, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment. That mix of slowing growth and higher spending spooked the bulls.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in 2023 Meta's revenue and EPS rose 16% and 73%, respectively. It countered Apple's iOS changes with new tools for gathering first-party data, widened its moat against TikTok by expanding Reels, and offset its declining ad prices with more ad impressions. It also attracted an influx of spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to reach more overseas customers. It also approved a $50 billion buyback and initiated its first dividend earlier this year.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to grow 18% and 36%, respectively. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 24 times forward earnings.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the world's fastest-growing cybersecurity companies. Unlike many of its peers, which install their services through on-site appliances, CrowdStrike only provides its end-to-end security tools as cloud-native services -- which are stickier, more cost-efficient, and easier to scale as an organization expands.\n\nCrowdStrike's revenue surged 54% in fiscal 2023 (which ended in Jan. 2023) and grew 36% in fiscal 2024. Its growth decelerated as the macro headwinds made it harder for the company to lock large customers into longer contracts.\n\nAs a result, its net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) declined in the first half of fiscal 2024. But in the second half of fiscal 2024, its net new ARR increased year over year again. That stabilization was supported by its market share gains, new government contracts, and generative AI upgrades for its extended detection and response (XDR) platform. It's also cross-selling more modules to its existing customers.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 30% and 27%, respectively. Its stock might seem pricey relative to its peers at 88 times forward earnings, but I believe its rapid growth and early mover's advantage in the cloud-native cybersecurity space justify its premium valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Has Gained Over $1 Trillion in Market Cap in 2024. Can It Do It Again to Surpass Microsoft and Apple to Become the Most Valuable Company in the World?",
        "content": "After gaining 239% in 2023 to become the best-performing component of the S&P 500, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has sustained its momentum so far this year. The stock has nearly doubled -- gaining over $1.1 trillion in market cap year to date -- and 2024 isn't even halfway over.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Nvidia was worth $359 billion. And suddenly, less than a year and a half later, it could be worth $3 trillion, surpassing Microsoft and Apple in market cap.\n\nAt the rate the stock is going up, Nvidia is on track to accomplish that feat by year-end. But no growth stock goes up in a near-straight line forever. Let's find out what it would take for Nvidia to slow down, and even if it does, why it could still take pole position as the most valuable company in the world. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nChecking all the boxes\n\nOne look at Nvidia's price chart over the last couple of years, and it's hard to argue that the stock isn't overvalued. It looks like yet another case of a stock that ran too far too fast and is primed for a sell-off. And maybe it is.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has (mostly) gone up for the right reasons. The extent of the run-up may be overdone, but Nvidia checks all the boxes that growth investors look for. And when the story is that good, the only thing preventing a stock from soaring is the valuation.\n\nA hockey stick graph, or hockey stick curve, resembles flattish growth and then a sharp upward-sloping line to the right that illustrates breakneck growth. Nvidia's sales and net income have this pattern in spades. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNvidia is converting nearly $0.50 on every dollar in sales into net income -- not gross profit or operating income, but bottom-line net income. That is an incredible achievement, especially at the scale at which Nvidia is doing it.\n\nNvidia also has extremely high operating margins -- higher than any other \"Magnificent Seven\" company -- a term that refers to large, industry-leading growth stocks Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. NVDA Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nTo top it all off, Nvidia has a net cash position on its balance sheet. In fact, it makes money on its cash -- generating over $600 million in interest income over the last 12 months. NVDA Net Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis is what checking all the boxes looks like. But the question is how long can Nvidia keep growing at this rate?\n\nSpearheading a revolutionary market\n\nSustained rallies in the stock market aren't always smoke and mirrors. In Nvidia's case, the company has done a phenomenal job monetizing its computing power in various industries. If you go back and look at Nvidia's annual reports from a few years ago -- or better yet -- five-plus years ago, you'll notice that the company looked almost indistinguishable from today.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's biggest market used to be selling graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming, personal computers, and data visualization. All of these applications involve massive data sets that need to be visualized and analyzed, and that require immense computing power. These are still profitable and growing business segments for Nvidia, but they don't make or break the business like in past years.\n\nThe crypto industry figured out that Nvidia's GPUs were great for mining (what blockchain networks use to affirm transactions and release new coins into circulation). This opportunity expanded the end use cases for its product offering even further.\n\nNvidia's products are also useful for increasingly sophisticated automobiles and help support electric vehicles.\n\nBut the value of these use cases pales in comparison to what Nvidia's GPUs were seemingly born to do: handle massive datasets and compile simulations for data centers to address customers' artificial intelligence (AI) needs. The change didn't happen overnight, but product improvements and technological breakthroughs have positioned Nvidia as a leader in AI because it makes the products that complex AI models need to run.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia's compute and networking segment made up over 77% of revenue and 85% of segment operating income. The reason Nvidia's stock price is unrecognizable from where it was a few years ago is because Nvidia (the company) is also unrecognizable.\n\nThe best bull case for Nvidia is that it is a rally backed by fundamentals and a multidecade growth industry. If AI adoption continues, it stands to reason that Nvidia will continue to see increased demand.\n\nFour challenges worth considering\n\nAs great as Nvidia's business looks today, I think there are four main challenges investors should consider before buying the stock.\n\nThe first is competition. Nvidia is vulnerable to losing market share even if the overall market opportunity keeps getting bigger.\n\nThe second is AI adoption slowing. Right now, companies are investing in AI, which is a boon for Nvidia's business. But eventually, they'll have to make a return on those investments. Investing in AI and monetizing AI are two completely different things. For example, Adobe's recent results disappointed Wall Street and sent the stock tumbling. Adobe is heavily investing in AI and is seeing great results and product improvements -- but it has been expensive and is damaging its short-term earnings results, which is testing investors' patience. That's not exactly good news for Nvidia, considering Adobe is a major customer.\n\nThe third concern, which is related to the second, is the cyclicality of the chip industry. Nvidia isn't a software-as-a-service company with consistent inflows -- it sometimes gets huge spikes in orders followed by order declines. Meta Platforms plans to spend $10 billion on Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2024. That's a massive purchase, not an annual recurring expense.\n\nThis rapid sales surge, followed by a decline in growth, is reflected in analyst consensus earnings per share (EPS) projections, which call for $24.98 in fiscal 2025 EPS, followed by $32.10 in fiscal 2026 EPS. Nvidia earned $11.93 in fiscal 2024 EPS -- implying that EPS would more than double in fiscal 2025, but then decelerate and grow by less than 30% in fiscal 2026.\n\nThat leads me to the fourth concern: valuation. Nvidia has a sky-high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 79 -- but due to the expected growth, the forward P/E is a much more reasonable 37.6. That gives Nvidia a lower forward P/E than Costco Wholesale -- illustrating that rapid earnings growth can make a seemingly expensive stock look more affordable. But that forward P/E is only if Nvidia achieves analysts' lofty expectations. Still, anything close to those estimates would be a big win and could drive the stock higher. That's not really the concern. The bigger risk is what comes after that. So much growth in so little time may open the door to a slowdown.\n\nLet's say that Nvidia shoots up another 50% by the time its fiscal 2024 results are out and achieves the consensus estimates. At that point, the company would be worth over $3.5 trillion. And assuming Microsoft and Apple stall, that would make Nvidia the most valuable company in the world. But the stock would also have a P/E over of around 56. And if growth is only expected to be 30%, investors may realize that's simply too high of a price to pay, even for a great company.\n\nA bad setup\n\nI could see Nvidia pushing the limits of a $3 trillion market cap if investors get enamored with its growth in fiscal 2024. But the problem is that the stock is somewhat set up to fail over the next three to five years given its near-term growth will make its comps that much harder in fiscal 2026 and beyond.\n\nPair that backdrop with uncertainty, the cyclicality of the chip industry, and unforeseen challenges, and the risk simply outweighs the reward.\n\nTo consider buying Nvidia, I'd have to see the valuation make more sense on a multiyear time horizon. If growth slows and it falls out of favor, Nvidia could start to look really cheap. But for now, it's just too hot of a story that can seemingly do no wrong.\n\nUltimately, I think Microsoft maintains its crown as the most valuable company simply because it has a more of a rinse-and-repeat, less cyclical business model that spans a variety of end markets. It is also high margin and has plenty of cash to fuel dividends, buy back stock, and make strategic acquisitions.\n\nNvidia has what it takes to gain another $1 trillion in market cap, but there are too many question marks beyond that outlook to consider buying the stock now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Today, we delve into the world of hedge fund titan Paul Tudor Jones and explore three Paul Tudor Jones stocks that offer a glimpse into his investment strategy. Jones has a knack for spotting opportunities in overlooked corners of the market. His investment philosophy, which balances macroeconomic insights with quantitative analysis, has guided Tudor Investment Corp. to remarkable heights. All across the globe, investors are seeking out stocks backed by Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nFrom technological advancements to shifts in consumer behavior, the variables influencing stock performance on Wall Street are numerous. However, Paul Tudor Jones’ recent moves highlight his confidence in specific sectors that promise robust growth and stability. These include technology, green energy, and consumer goods—areas that not only align with current market trends but also resonate with forward-thinking investment strategies.\n\nMany on Wall Street note that the firm’s approach is meticulous, focusing on diversification, market timing, and, most importantly, resilience in the face of market volatilities. For those looking to invest like a hedge fund king, understanding the dynamics behind Jones’ choices is important. Therefore, today we discuss three Paul Tudor Jones stocks and exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), handpicked from his portfolio, representing a unique blend of stability and growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks Backed by Paul Tudor Jones: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong Paul Tudor Jones stocks we are covering is the diversified health care company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The business operates through four main segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. These units focus on a wide range of health care needs, from insurance coverage and benefits to pharmacy care services and health management solutions. UnitedHealth’s integrated business model allows it to serve millions of patients, leveraging vast data insights while managing costs effectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, UnitedHealth Group reported strong performance across its business segments. As a result, revenues came in at $99.8 billion, up nearly $8 billion year-over-year (YoY). Management grew its commercial benefits significantly, adding 2 million more people. Optum Health is on track to expand its value-based care arrangements, while Optum Rx saw a 12% revenue growth. Despite challenges such as the recent cyberattack, the company reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, UnitedHealth Group is focused on modernizing the health care system and expanding its value-based care offerings, which are expected to drive sustainable long-term growth. The reaffirmed long-term earnings-per-share (“EPS”) growth objective of 13-16% highlights the company’s confidence in its strategic direction and operational capabilities. In addition, UnitedHealth Group’s significant investments in technology, particularly in data analytics and telehealth, are expected to drive future growth.\n\nYear-to-date, UNH stock has traded flat, in part due to Wall Street concerns over the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Meanwhile, the current dividend yield is 1.4% and the shares are trading at 19 times forward earnings. Analysts are eyeing an upward move of over 8% in the 12 months ahead. If you’re looking for a robust business model and a strategic approach to growth and innovation in the health care market, then UnitedHealth Group stock needs to be on your radar. Easily, this is one of the best stocks backed by Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a website\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnimal health heavyweight Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the next company among our featured Paul Tudor Jones stocks. The company develops animal health medicines and vaccines, serving a large market, including livestock and companion animals.\n\nAt present, Zoetis has a market capitalization (cap) of approximately $80 billion. Zoetis’s first quarter of 2024 was marked by a 12% operational revenue growth and a 15% increase in adjusted net income. The company has raised its operational guidance for 2024. There has been strong demand for its companion animal products and robust performance across its parasiticide and dermatology franchises. The launch of new products like Librela and Solensia for osteoarthritis in dogs and cats has also contributed to recent growth.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Zoetis’s financial performance, projecting a steady increase in EPS” in the coming years. For the fiscal year 2024, the mean EPS estimate stands at $5.77. Expectations rise to $6.37 by 2025 and $7.02 by 2026. Meanwhile, Zoetis continues to expand its presence in emerging markets, where the demand for animal healthcare products is growing rapidly. The company’s focus on countries such as China, Brazil, and India positions it well to capture growth opportunities in these regions.\n\nYet, so far in 2024, ZTS stock has declined about 11.5%, while the shares are changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings (“P/E”) ratio of 30x. Finally, the current 12-month price forecast suggests a potential increase of over 25%. Interested readers should also note the dividend yield of 1%.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) S&P 500 on wooden blocks as someone turns an arrow pointing either up or down. SPY stock. Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Dmitry Demidovich / Shutterstock\n\nWe end our discussion of Paul Tudor Jones stocks with an ETF, namely the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), which gives access to the S&P 500 index, the barometer for the U.S. market. The index, managed by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), is a market-capitalization-weighted index comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies stateside. It covers approximately 80% of available market cap. As of May 2024, the total market cap of the S&P 500 stands at approximately $44 trillion. About a year ago, it was around $34 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is one of the widely traded and largest ETFs in the world. At present, SPY manages over $525 billion in assets. In terms of sectors, information technology leads the list with 30%. Then we see financials (30%), health care (12%), communication services (9%), and industrials (8%), among others. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are SPY’s four largest holdings, comprising about 22% of the fund’s roster.\n\nAs of date, SPY has posted a YTD gain of approximately 11%. This alignment with the resturn of the S&P 500 index underscores the ETF’s effectiveness in providing exposure to the index. Potential investors should also note the dividend yield of 1.3% and the annual expense ratio of 0.09% for SPY while they may consider the fund as a Paul Tudor Jones stock.

        "title": "Markets brace for Nvidia earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks are once again ending a trading week having hit new records.\n\nSigns of an inflation cooldown prompted markets to grow more optimistic about the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and stocks rallied as a result, with all three major averages hitting record highs on Wednesday.\n\nFor the week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1%, closing above 40,000 for the first time ever on Friday.\n\nIn the week ahead, highly anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to be the key catalyst for markets. Results from Target (TGT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Lowe's (LOW) will also be closely tracked by investors.\n\nThe week is expected to be quieter on the economic front, with updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors as well as the final reading of consumer sentiment for May on tap. Minutes from the Fed's May meeting are also expected on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMinute by minute\n\nApril's reading of the Consumer Price Index showed core prices, which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 3.6% over last year — the lowest annual rise in three years. This prompted investors to price in two full interest rate cuts this year for the first time since early April.\n\nThe move brings the market closer in line with the Fed's projections of two or three interest rate cuts at some point this year. BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski listed investors' alignment with the Fed on interest rate cuts as a reason supporting his call for the S&P 500 to end 2024 at 5,600, an increase of less than 7% from Friday's close.\n\nFor investors, the key question will be whether this bullish narrative is sustainable or if the market will once again jump ahead of the Fed as it did in early 2024 when investors priced in nearly seven interest rate cuts on the back of positive economic data. The first test will come on Wednesday with the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, which will provide a deeper look at the discussion among officials.\n\n\"The minutes from the May FOMC meeting should sound more hawkish on the margin than Chair Powell's press conference,\" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. \"Though Powell signaled the bar for hikes is high and that standing pat is the proper response to disinflation stalling out, others on the committee were more concerned about whether policy was doing enough.\"\n\nStory continues Fed Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference at the end of Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 2024. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) (SAUL LOEB via Getty Images)\n\nThe bulls are on the run\n\nBelski's year-end target bump was followed by another forecast raise on Friday. Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 5,500 from 5,100. Chadha cited robust earnings growth and an improving macroeconomic outlook as reasons stocks could keep moving higher.\n\n\"We see the earnings cycle having plenty of legs,\" Chadha said. \"While all the growth may not materialize this year, we see market confidence in a continued recovery rising by year end, supporting equity multiples.\"\n\nNvidia's big report\n\nAI leader Nvidia is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, capping off the reports from America's tech giants. Expectations are once again sky-high for the chipmaker. Analysts expect Nvidia grew earnings by more than 400% in the prior quarter while revenue increased 242%, per Bloomberg consensus data.\n\nFor the second quarter, analysts project earnings growth of more than 120% and nearly 100% revenue growth.\n\n\"We see enough room for NVDA to post FQ1E (April) revenue potentially as high as $26B (data center ~$22-23B) and potentially guide to ~$27-28B in total revenue (data center ~$25-26B) — both good enough to keep the stock biased higher, in our view,\" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a note to clients previewing the earnings release. The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Feb. 11, 2015. (REUTERS/Robert Galbraith) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe stock is up more than 86% in 2024 and more than 200% over the past year since Nvidia kicked off the AI hype train with its blowout earnings report in May 2023. Given how Nvidia's stock has impacted other potential AI plays, and the broader market as a whole, all eyes will be on whether the company can once again live up to the hype.\n\n\"If [Nvidia] can continue their enviable, remarkable string of beating estimates, raising guidance, then beating the raised guidance next quarter, that means that the AI trade can and will proceed apace,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a research note on Thursday. \"If there is even the slightest sign of weakness, however, much more than that stock alone will suffer.\"\n\nThe expansion of the AI trade\n\nNvida's updates on its emerging technology demand come at a crucial time for the overall AI story. Increasingly, new companies in sectors are being tabbed AI trades.\n\nJust this past week, Dell shares rose about 10% as analysts from Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI revealed bullish research on the company's AI prospects.\n\nThe AI trade has already been expanding beyond the popular names like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META). Energy and Utilities are two of the best performing sectors in the S&P 500 this year, both adding more than 13%. While strategists have pointed to a catch-up trade in Utilities (XLU), AI has also been a driver of enthusiasm. The same could be said for Energy (XLE).\n\nResearch from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter amid a \"broadening of the AI trade.\" More than 66% of companies in the energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.\n\nJPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley said whether the AI story has legs \"might be one of the more important questions that we have to ask.\"\n\n\"Is this AI stuff the real deal or is it a flash in the plan?\" Manley told Yahoo Finance. \"And I mean, frankly, the jury is still out on whether or not it will fundamentally transform the world.\"\n\nHe added, \"If markets wake up to say 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit, and that's reflected in those valuations.' That's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\"\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEarnings: Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Trip.com (TRIP), Zoom (ZM)\n\nEconomic news: No notable economic news.\n\nTuesday\n\nEarnings: AutoZone (AZO), Macy's (M), XPeng (XPEV), Toll Brothers (TOL), Urban Outfitters (URBN)\n\nEconomic news: Philadelphia Fed Non-Manufacturing Activity, May (-12.4 previously)\n\nWednesday\n\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), e.l.f.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Next Big Announcement",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) never is short on big news. Most recently, the company wowed investors with details of its new Blackwell architecture and said the launch will happen later this year. And prior to this, Nvidia said it aimed to start shipping its H200 graphics processing unit (GPU) -- which doubles the performance of its current chip -- in the second quarter of the year.\n\nAll of this along with soaring earnings have helped the stock roar higher, climbing more than 200% over the past year. Now, a couple of days ahead of Nvidia's quarterly earnings report, it's logical to wonder about the company's next big announcement. And my prediction is, this time, it may not have to do with an upcoming product. Instead, it may be a move that directly impacts Nvidia's share price... Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia stock approaches $1,000\n\nSo, as mentioned, Nvidia's stock price has climbed in recent years, and today it's reached more than $940. Some analysts even see it surging well beyond $1,000 within the coming 12 months. It seems very possible considering Nvidia's earnings over the past several quarters. This leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has reported triple-digit and even quadruple-digit gains in earnings, and growth isn't likely to taper off any time soon.\n\nThat's because we're in the early days of the AI story, so demand is far from reaching a peak. For example, the percentage of companies mentioning AI on their earnings calls has climbed significantly in recent years -- but it still was only at about 16% last year, according to Goldman Sachs, as quoted by Statista. So there's a lot of room for growth. And forecasts for an AI market worth more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade further support the idea of more growth to come.\n\nNvidia, in its forecast for the fiscal 2025 first quarter, has said it expects to report $24 billion in revenue -- representing yet another triple-digit increase in revenue year over year. And along with this and other news during Wednesday's earnings report, the company may make a big announcement directly related to share price.\n\nI predict Nvidia may launch a stock split, a move that lowers the price of each individual share without changing the overall market value of the company. Companies do this by issuing additional shares to current holders.\n\nStock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share performance, but they can be positive for a company over time as they do make it easier for smaller investors to get in on a particular stock. The price of $1,000 for a stock represents a psychological barrier for some investors -- who automatically consider the price too high even if the actual valuation remains reasonable. And some investors don't have access to fractional shares or prefer buying full shares, pushing a $1,000 stock beyond their reach.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's stock split history\n\nNow, let's consider Nvidia's stock split history, which shows the company is open to such moves. Nvidia has completed five stock splits over the past two decades, and on each occasion the stock was trading much lower than today's level. So it seems possible that now, with the stock approaching $1,000 and plenty of growth on the horizon to trigger additional gains, Nvidia would consider a new stock split.\n\nShould you wait for a potential split to buy Nvidia or get in on the stock right now? The great news is you can do either. Nvidia is a market leader and focuses on the investment needed to remain in its position -- on top of this, the company happens to be operating in one of today's highest-growth areas.\n\nNvidia's prospects are bright, and that means whether you invest in, say, a fractional share today or wait to buy multiple shares if the company completes a stock split in the near future, the outcome will be the same. If you keep your Nvidia holding for the long term, you're likely to benefit as this exciting AI growth story unfolds.\n\nSo, whether my prediction is correct or not, an Nvidia purchase today or in the months to come, as part of a diversified portfolio, still may help you along the path to financial freedom over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Wednesday?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the undisputed beneficiary of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Since early last year, the adoption of AI has spread like wildfire, fueled by Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). The company will face a key hurdle when it reports its first-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and Wall Street will be sitting on the edge of its seat to parse the results.\n\nThe stock has gained an incredible 548% since the start of last year (as of this writing), fueled by strong and accelerating demand for AI. Nvidia has been the unofficial standard bearer of the AI revolution, but investors are beginning to wonder if the trend can continue at its recent breakneck pace.\n\nWith the scene set, should investors buy Nvidia stock before its highly anticipated first-quarter report? Let's examine the available evidence. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA make-or-break quarter?\n\nThe initial excitement has worn off in recent months and investors are no longer taking the AI revolution on faith. Yet, the major cloud services have been vocal about the ongoing demand for generative AI and their plans to boost investment in the space.\n\nMicrosoft increased its capital expenditures by 79% to $14 billion in the calendar first quarter, while Alphabet's spending grew by 90% to $12 billion. Amazon spent $14 billion in the first quarter, which it expects will be the low point of spending for the year, expecting capex spending to \"meaningfully increase\" thanks to AI.\n\nSince data centers and cloud infrastructure providers are among Nvidia's largest customers, that would seem to bode well for the company's upcoming report.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 30), analysts expect Nvidia's sales to surge 277% to $24.6 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) jumping from $0.83 to $4.57.\n\nWhile results of that magnitude might seem unlikely, consider this: in the fourth quarter, Nvidia generated record revenue that jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, and its outlook is calling for Q1 revenue of $24 billion -- and its guidance tends to be conservative.\n\nIs the writing on the wall?\n\nSeveral AI-centric companies have reported results in recent weeks, and the market's reaction has been puzzling, to say the least.\n\nEarlier this month, AI software and data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) reported first-quarter revenue that grew 21% year over year and 4% sequentially to $634 million, while its adjusted EPS jumped 60%. Wall Street found its guidance lacking, however, and the stock fell 15% on the day following its report.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended March 31), chip designer Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) reported revenue that grew 47% year over year to $928 million, while adjusted EPS of $0.36 soared 1,700% (not a typo). Despite the surge in both sales and profits, investors were hoping for more robust guidance, and the stock fell 2% following the release of its results.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) delivered record revenue that jumped 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while adjusted EPS soared 308% to $6.65. Despite raising its guidance, Wall Street wanted more, and the stock tumbled 14% on the day following its report.\n\nEagle-eyed investors will have noticed a pattern emerging. Despite strong, expectation-beating results, Wall Street is looking to the future and taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nThese results suggest that while demand for AI remains high, investors are not only demanding stellar results but looking for robust guidance to confirm that the secular tailwinds of AI continue to blow.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock now or wait until after earnings?\n\nHow you answer this question depends on what type of investor you are. For those looking to buy ownership in a business with a strong track record of execution, savvy management, and technological tailwinds, and have plans to hold it for the long term, then Nvidia might just be the stock for you.\n\nIf, however, you're looking to jump into the stock before earnings in the hopes that it will pop so you can make a quick exit, then Nvidia might end up being a disappointment. Truth be told, there's simply no way to know for sure whether Nvidia stock will go up or down after it reports on Wednesday.\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to think that investors continue to underestimate the continuing strong deman for AI and the fundamental changes it will bring to the fore. That said, unless Nvidia significantly boosts its guidance, the stock could tumble.\n\nThat said, Nvidia has shown a knack for skating to where the puck is going rather than where it's been. The company continues to spend heavily on research and development, which amounted to 20% of its 2023 revenue. Nvidia is already working on the next generation of industry-leading AI processors, which is how it stays so far ahead of the competition.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Nvidia's valuation. At 79 times trailing 12-month earnings, the stock might seem exorbitantly expensive if not for three consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, with another likely on the way. However, Nvidia is selling for 38 times next year's earnings, and while that's a bit on the high side, it's justified by the company's meteoric growth.\n\nHowever, for those looking beyond the current quarter, I believe Nvidia's track record and history of innovations speak for itself, making it a buy for investors intending to hold for years if not decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $566,624!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Sold Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. You Won't Believe What He Bought Instead.",
        "content": "Investors could do worse than investing in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. The collective gained 111%, on average, in 2023, thrashing the 24% gains of the S&P 500. The group has continued its winning ways, rising 22% on average so far this year, nearly double the 11% increase of the S&P 500 (as of this writing).\n\nThe common thread that unites these tech bellwethers is that they each have artificial intelligence (AI) in their DNA. In recent months, however, some investors have begun to fear that the rally that propelled the Magnificent Seven higher is no longer sustainable and have been looking to other quarters for growth.\n\nAmong those investors is billionaire David Tepper, who heads Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund he founded in 1993. Tepper is worth roughly $20.6 billion and has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation,\" for his knack for consistently outperforming his industry peers.\n\nIt's notable, then, that Tepper decreased his exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks to close out the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOut with the old...\n\nA regulatory filing released just this week revealed that Tepper had made big changes among his largest holdings, decreasing his stake in each of the five Magnificent Seven stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio.\n\nTepper cut his stake in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by 44%. He obviously still believes there's additional potential, since Appaloosa still owns 442,000 shares worth an estimated $417 million (as of this writing). It's still the fund's fifth largest holding at roughly 6% of the portfolio.\n\nThe move was probably strategic on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia stock is up a massive 546% since early last year, thanks to accelerating demand for its AI-centric processors. Given its remarkable run, there's likely not as much upside -- at least over the short term.\n\nTepper also slashed his stake in Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock by 39%, though it remains a cornerstone holding. Appaloosa still owns 1.1 million shares worth about $531 million, as the fund's fourth-largest holding.\n\nMeta Platforms is the second-best performer among the Magnificent Seven, sporting gains of 293% since early last year. The digital advertising market is in the midst of a remarkable recovery, which will continue to boost Meta's fortunes, but Tepper clearly believes he can get better gains elsewhere.\n\nTepper also reduced his stakes in Microsoft by 18%, Alphabet by 10%, and Amazon by 3%, likely to raise funds for his latest purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo me, the most surprising part of Tepper's move wasn't so much what he sold but what he bought instead, building his positions in a number of well-known Chinese stocks.\n\n...In with the new\n\nAppaloosa's biggest additions in Q1 are among China's most well-known companies.\n\nTepper boosted his stake in Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) by 158%. Appaloosa now owns 11.25 million shares worth an estimated $814 million. That makes the company Appaloosa's No. 1 holding at more than 12% of the portfolio.\n\nAlibaba is best known as one of the largest e-commerce providers in China, which includes its Taobao and T-mall sites. Alibaba Cloud is the world's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure provider, with 4% of the market, behind Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, with 31%, 25%, and 11%, respectively. The company has also been investing heavily in AI to boost its competitive advantages and has noted that much of its recent cloud growth has been driven by AI.\n\nTepper also increased his stake in PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD), also known as Pinduoduo, by 171%. Appaloosa now owns 2.1 million shares worth an estimated $244 million. As a result, it has risen to its ninth-largest holding at nearly 4% of the portfolio.\n\nPinduoduo's online marketplace has become the world's second-largest e-commerce company and the largest in China. The company is leveraging its position by expanding internationally with its Temu platform and has been growing faster than its larger rival, Alibaba.\n\nFinally, Tepper increased his stake in China's search leader Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU) by 188%. The hedge fund now owns 1.8 million shares worth an estimated $190 million. As a result, it has risen to its 10th-largest holding at roughly 3% of the portfolio.\n\nAside from its search supremacy, Baidu is one of the largest digital advertisers in China and provides a host of internet and AI-related services.\n\nShould investors follow suit?\n\nIt isn't too surprising that Tepper would see value in stocks from China. Earlier this year, China's CSI 300 Index fell to a five-year low as the country's economy continued to struggle. Contracting manufacturing activity, which had fallen for four successive months, helped fuel the decline.\n\nThis has driven the valuations of some of China's most popular stocks to multi-year lows. Even after an uptick in Q1, PDD, Alibaba, and Baidu are selling for 25 times, 20 times, and 14 times trailing 12-month earnings, a discount to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 for the S&P 500.\n\nTepper's moves may have been wise. Over the past few months, there have been improvements in China's economic prospects. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.3% year over year in Q1, while the manufacturing and services sectors grew by 6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nThat said, investors should be aware of the additional risk factors that are part of investing in China. The economy is still a wild card, government crackdowns can negatively affect investments, and relations between China and the U.S. are frequently rocky.\n\nWhile Tepper's picks may seem intriguing, investors should merely use this information as a starting point and do their own research to determine if these stocks are a good fit with their investing philosophy and risk tolerance.\n\nIt's worth noting that Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Alphabet collectively still make up 38% of Tepper's portfolio, so he obviously believes each of these stocks has room to run. However, it's clear from his purchases this quarter that Tepper believes China stocks could have more upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve is to publish the minutes of its latest meeting and several Fed officials are to deliver remarks as renewed expectations for rate cuts power markets higher. AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is to report earnings, PMI releases will give insights into the health of the global economy, while the U.K. is to release what will be closely watched inflation data and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.\n\nFed minutes, speakers\n\nOn Wednesday the Fed is due to publish the minutes of its April 30-May 1 meeting, when Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that rates are likely to remain higher for longer amid lingering inflation pressures.\n\nSince then, a report last week showed that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April, indicating that inflation resumed its downward trend at the start of the second quarter.\n\nSeveral Fed officials are also due to speak during the week, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Governors Michael Barr, Christopher Waller and Philip Jefferson, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, New York Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes reports on new and existing home sales, durable goods orders and consumer sentiment.\n\nNvidia earnings\n\nNvidia's quarterly results on Wednesday could set the tone for U.S. stock markets and reverberate through companies exposed to the burgeoning artificial intelligence field.\n\nThe semiconductor company at the centre of the excitement over AI's business potential is expected to report a massive jump in revenue and profit for its fiscal first quarter.\n\nRevenue is expected to rise to $24.8 billion, from $7.2 billion a year earlier, with earnings per share soaring to $5.57 from $1.09, according to LSEG data cited by Reuters.\n\nNvidia may need to meet those lofty expectations and then some to keep its soaring stock price moving higher. Shares have jumped over 90% this year after more than tripling in 2023, making the AI darling the third-largest U.S. company by market value.\n\nPMI data\n\nThe U.S., China, the euro zone and the U.K. are all to release May PMI data that should reinforce a brighter global economic outlook.\n\nA slow euro area recovery appears to be underway after six straight quarters of stagnant or negative growth, U.S. inflation just resumed its downward trend and China grew faster than expected in the first quarter.\n\nSo, global PMIs should stay on the right side of the line between expansion and contraction.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet steep U.S. tariff increases on Chinese imports from electric vehicle batteries to computer chips highlight a fragile outlook for global trade and growth. China has vowed retaliation.\n\nManufacturers in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, are already experiencing shifts in world trade and geopolitics. Heightened trade tensions - with a U.S. election looming - could hurt them further, upend China's recovery and reignite U.S. inflation.\n\nU.K. inflation data\n\nThe U.K. is to publish April CPI data on Wednesday with economists expecting the annual rate of inflation to have slowed dramatically - by more than a percentage point - to near the 2% level targeted by the Bank of England.\n\nThere is one more inflation report due out ahead of the next BoE meeting on June 20 and sustained evidence of cooling price pressures could give officials all the encouragement they need to cut interest rates.\n\nAhead of the inflation numbers BoE Governor Andrew Baily is due to deliver remarks on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.K. economic calendar also features April retail sales data on Friday.\n\nRBNZ decision\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday for a seventh straight meeting, against a background of persistent inflation and a stalling economy.\n\nThe RBNZ was the first major central bank to ease at the start of the pandemic, and the first to hike in the aftermath.\n\nMarket bets for an eventual rate cut in October put it behind the European Central Bank which is expected to move in June, followed by the BoE in August and the Fed in September. Switzerland and Sweden have started easing.\n\nThe RBNZ itself is even less optimistic, projecting no rate cuts until next year.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nChina launches anti-dumping probe into EU, US, Japan, Taiwan chemicals\n\nHouston area grapples with heat, power cuts after major storms\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Jim Cramer on Friday analyzed the market rally following the latest CPI data which showed inflation was easing in April. Cramer said bears are clearly fighting an \"uphill\" battle and unless they could get any clear sign that inflation is heating up, he expects the rally to continue.\n\nCramer Thinks The Market is \"Outrageously Bullish\"\n\nIn another program last week Cramer said this market feels \"almost blasphemous\" to him because it's led by an \"outrageously bullish\" combination of stocks, many of which he believes don’t deserve to rally.\n\nJim Cramer said that the NASDAQ, S&P 500 and the Dow recently touching record \"defies\" the conventional wisdom on \"what could happen\" at this stage of the business cycle.\n\n\"Shut Up and Drive\"\n\nCramer yet again let it out on the bears and market skeptics, saying the bears \"have had it wrong.\" Cramer said when you look at the stocks they tell you that market naysayers continuously warning about a hot economy, high CPI, budget deficit and low consumer sentiment are \"awful.\" According to Cramer, the stocks are saying:\n\n\"Shut up and drive!\"\n\nJim Cramer highlighted that in the past, when one group of stocks was going higher, usually its opposite camp declined. But this trend has been defied in the recent market rallies where apparently \"mutually exclusive\" group of stocks are surging at the same time — banks, tech, industrials, utilities, to name a few.\n\nCramer Awaits the \"Biggest Earnings Report of the Entire Year\"\n\nCramer is also on tenterhooks, waiting for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, which he called the \"biggest earnings report of the entire year.\"\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired in May and picked 5 stocks he's recommending investors in the current environment. Instead of Cramer's famous picks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), you will see some new, lesser-known names in the list.\n\nMind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 4\n\nMind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD) is working on treatments for psychiatry, addiction, pain and neurology. Cramer said in a latest program that he likes any company working on treatments that help people \"do good\" and \"get rid of pain\" without getting them \"hooked.\" He also said that he is a \"believer\" in Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc (NASDAQ:MNMD).\n\nHe also said he doesn’t \"care\" if such stocks don't make a lot of money for now because people should \"recognize\" that this is an \"unmet need\" and it \"will make money in the end.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nWhile talking about IT consulting company Accenture, Jim Cramer said in a latest program that he thinks SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is better than Accenture.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). The most notable stake in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $983 million stake in the company.\n\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is up about 28% so far this year.\n\nPolen Global Growth Strategy stated the following regarding SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance during the first quarter were SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), Apple (not owned), and Amazon.\n\nAfter delivering a robust fourth quarter, SAP’s stock price again rose significantly in the first quarter of 2024 on solid 4Q23 earnings and full-year guidance that was revised modestly higher. Importantly, SAP’s transition to the cloud (a core part of our thesis on the business) continues at pace, and the company is seeing both strong cloud revenue growth and expanding cloud gross margins. Management is guiding cloud sales growth through 2025 in the mid-20% range, which we view as reasonable and attractive. We view SAP as one of the more resilient software business models as it is an essential part of their customers’ day-to-day operations and cannot easily be turned off or scaled back. Additionally, we think CEO Christian Klein is honest, competent, and long-term minded— traits we value highly in leadership.”\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nWe recently covered that Jim Cramer was in a wait-and-see mode on Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) ahead of a key decision in which Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) was expected to give a verdict on its hefty dividend and business outlook. Cramer was expecting the company to cut its dividend, which he believed would be a logical decision to make. Lo and behold, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) rattled investors by slashing its dividend by a whopping 80%. After the cut, while the stock tumbled to new lows, Cramer sounded bullish on the stock, expressing his full trust in CEO Sandra B. Cochran.\n\nCramer thinks Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) CEO will \"succeed\" with the new transformation because \"she is a hitter.\"\n\nIn addition to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Cramer is also bullish on Cracker Barrel.\n\nModine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer is extremely bullish on Modine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD). When asked about the Wisconsin-based thermal management company during his latest program, Cramer said, while hitting the buy, buy, buy button:\n\n\"Ok, that kind of metal-bending industrial company is precisely what's working here.\"\n\nCramer also said that Modine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD) is a \"Club-like\" name, saying his investing club propends investing in stocks similar to Modine Manufacturing Co (NYSE:MOD).\n\nIn addition to MOD, Cramer also likes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nCarillon Chartwell Small Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE:MOD) was another strong performer. Modine’s performance technologies segment is experiencing high demand as it provides thermal solutions for electronic vehicle (EV) and hybrid vehicle manufacturers. The company also has focused on growth opportunities in the data-center market, selling data center cooling solutions needed for energy intensive artificial intelligence (AI) projects.”\n\nModerna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nWhen asked about Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) recently, Jim Cramer said that he's a \"believer\" in the stock and he never \"backed away\" from his thesis on the stock. Cramer said Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) went \"crazy\" during the pandemic, then crashed:\n\n\"Ever since it crashed, I'm in, I'm in,\" Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer is recommending many more stocks in May.\n\nClick to see 5 More Jim Cramer Stock Picks in May 2024.\n\nDisclosure.None.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Run-Up? My Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy and Hold",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in recent months, and that's not surprising, as the company has played a critical role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nCompanies in the race to develop and deploy AI applications have been turning to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to utilize the parallel computational power of its chips so that they can train large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. As it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been so strong that the company has been finding it difficult to meet the end-market demand, leading to long waiting periods.\n\nThe good news is that Nvidia has been boosting its production capacity, and that explains why it is expected to deliver another year of solid growth in fiscal 2025 (which has just begun). Its top line is expected to grow nearly 84% this fiscal year to $112 billion, while the bottom line is expected to jump 91% to $24.87 per share. All this explains why investors have been piling into Nvidia stock, which has already gained more than 82% in 2024.\n\nNvidia looks well placed to justify its expensive trailing earnings multiple of 75, considering the potential growth it could deliver. The sharp increase in its earnings going forward is evident from a much lower forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37. However, investors who have missed Nvidia's terrific run-up and are wary of paying a rich earnings multiple can consider taking a closer look at Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nJust like Nvidia, Microsoft is also a key player in the AI market, and it can be bought at a reasonable valuation right now. Here's why savvy investors should consider doing that right away.\n\nMicrosoft stock is attractively valued, and AI is positively impacting its growth\n\nShares of Microsoft have gained only 10% so far this year. This explains why the stock can still be bought at a relatively reasonable earnings multiple of about 35, which is much lower than Nvidia's multiple. Microsoft's forward earnings multiple of 31 also represents a discount to that of Nvidia.\n\nOf course, Microsoft isn't growing as rapidly as Nvidia, but it has been consistently beating Wall Street's earnings expectations in recent quarters, and its growth has been accelerating.\n\nFor instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), Microsoft's revenue increased 17% year over year to $61.9 billion. That was a nice acceleration over the 7% revenue growth the company clocked in the same period last year.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft's earnings growth also improved to 20% year over year in the previous quarter, from 10% in the year-ago period. AI is playing a key role in this acceleration, as Microsoft management noted on the latest earnings conference call. CEO Satya Nadella remarked that the company's Azure cloud platform \"took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMore specifically, AI drove 7 percentage points worth of growth for Microsoft's Azure cloud business last quarter out of the segment's year-over-year growth of 31%. The growth could have been stronger had Microsoft been able to meet all the AI-related demand for cloud services, but the company said that demand has been higher than supply.\n\nThis explains why Microsoft has been ramping up its spending on cloud AI infrastructure across the globe in countries such as Japan, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the U.S. Even better, recent reports indicate that the tech giant could spend $100 billion on building a generative AI supercomputer through 2028. As such, Microsoft is setting itself up to make the most of the booming demand for cloud AI services in the long run.\n\nAccording to a third-party estimate, the cloud AI market was worth an estimated $43 billion in 2022. The market is expected to post 36% annual growth through 2032 and generate a whopping $887 billion in annual revenue. Microsoft has generated just over $100 billion in revenue from its Intelligent Cloud division business in the past year, and the incremental growth opportunity in the cloud AI market indicates that it has a lot of room to grow in this space.\n\nThrow in the potential AI-related gains that Microsoft could achieve in the AI-enabled personal computer and workplace productivity markets, and it won't be surprising to see the company's growth accelerating further in the long run.\n\nRobust earnings growth points toward a healthy stock price upside\n\nAnalysts are expecting Microsoft's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 16% over the next five years, which would be a slowdown compared to its 20% annual earnings growth in the past five years. However, observers have already seen that Microsoft's bottom-line growth is accelerating thanks to AI. So, it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings growing at a faster pace in the future.\n\nAssuming Microsoft manages to get an annual earnings growth rate of 25% over the next five years, its earnings could hit $29.93 per share in fiscal 2028 (using fiscal 2023 earnings of $9.81 per share as the base). Multiplying the projected earnings with Microsoft's five-year forward earnings of 29 points toward a stock price of $868 after five years -- a jump of 110% from current levels.\n\nBut if the market decides to reward Microsoft with a higher valuation or the company delivers stronger earnings growth, this AI stock could deliver much stronger gains. That's why investors who missed the Nvidia train should consider jumping onto Microsoft stock before it steps on the gas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $578,143!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are zooming. Even the private market is going like gangbusters. Right now, more than one-fifth of all venture capital funding is going toward AI start-ups, According to a report from Crunchbase.\n\nWant to get involved? Here are two AI stocks that have minted a sizable number of new millionaires in recent months.\n\n1. Nvidia: This 1 stock is the king of AI\n\nNo list of red-hot AI stocks would be complete without Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Global spending on AI systems and services reached $150 billion in 2023. This year some estimates say spending will surpass $200 billion. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. By 2033, Bloomberg Intelligence believes that generative AI will become a $1.3 trillion industry.\n\nThese AI applications will be powered by semiconductors, and the world will need a lot of them to meet burgeoning demand. This is why Nvidia's market cap ballooned from $200 billion to nearly $2.4 trillion in recent years. The company simply has a meaningful head start versus its competitors in supplying this rapid-growth industry with the materials it needs to function.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT was trained using Nvidia A100 processors in 2022, and its next-gen H100 processors have been manufactured at full capacity for more than a year. According to Fool contributor Harsh Chauhan, \"This lead has allowed Nvidia to exercise a solid grip over the AI chip market and also explains why its competitors' latest offerings aren't gaining much traction. For instance, [Advanced Micro Devices] sees its AI GPU sales hitting at least $4 billion in 2024. Intel is further behind and expects the Gaudi 3 launch to help it generate $500 million in AI chip sales in the second half of 2024.\"\n\nMany investors have already made millions with Nvidia stock, but be aware that most of the company's expected growth is still ahead of it. While sales have picked up dramatically in recent years, Nvidia's market cap growth has far outstripped this sales growth. And the stock's price-to-sales ratio soared -- roughly tripling over the last 12 months. Most of the quick money may have already been made with Nvidia stock, but this is still one of the best investments to make for long-term AI bulls. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\n2. Looking for the next big AI hit? SoundHound AI stock could be it.\n\nLooking for more rapid growth than a $2 trillion business can likely provide? Take a closer look at SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN).\n\nFounded in 2005, SoundHound is a voice AI and speech recognition company. Think of its products as the voice-enabled version of automated chatbots. With SoundHound, businesses can give customers a \"live\" representative capable of giving them customized directions and feedback. For now, its software is particularly well-suited for use cases with a narrow set of typical questions. Restaurants, for example -- one of SoundHound's biggest end markets -- can have a SoundHound AI agent respond to customer queries like, \"Do you take reservations?\" or \"What time do you open?\" SoundHound's software could foreseeably have huge adoption in fast food drive-thrus.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike most AI companies, SoundHound's revenue is small but growing quickly. Last quarter, sales jumped by 73% year over year to $11.6 million. With a $1.75 billion market cap, shares are expensive versus its current sales figures. But long-term growth could eventually make today's price tag look like a bargain. The company has the technology and early market adoption to make that future a reality. As Fool contributor Geoffrey Seiler writes, \"If its technology becomes a must-have feature and is widely adopted across devices and industries, then the sky is the limit and today's high valuation will look cheap down the line.\"\n\nEven Nvidia is bullish on SoundHound stock. Last quarter, Nvidia invested directly in several AI start-ups. SoundHound was one of them, with Nvidia investing $3.7 million for a 0.6% stake. If you're looking for high-upside AI stocks, SoundHound should be at the top of your watchlist.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "When people think of artificial intelligence (AI), they gravitate to graphics processing unit (GPU) chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- and rightly so. Nvidia currently has a huge lead making the chips needed for today's most advanced AI applications.\n\nBut AI benefits will offer growth opportunities for lots of tech companies that haven't seen their stocks run as far and fast as Nvidia.\n\nOn that note, there was big AI news this week for three tech giants, including two which aim to compete with Nvidia head-on.\n\nArm says it will begin making its own AI chips\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) went public last September in a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) that brought one of the two main semiconductor-architecture licensors to the market, with the other being the x86 architecture.\n\nToday, Arm is thriving, as use cases for its low-power chip architecture are proliferating. Revenue surged 47% last quarter on the back of strong licensing and royalty-revenue growth. That strong growth is not a surprise. Most cloud giants are gravitating toward the Arm architecture as they begin to design their own low-cost central processing unit (CPU) chips for their proprietary cloud offerings. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) uses Arm-based CPUs for its Grace CPUs that attach to their Grace-Hopper and Grace-Blackwell superchips, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) just introduced its own data-center CPU chip called Axion.\n\nHowever, Arm isn't getting to the meat of the AI revolution, as it doesn't license its architecture for the GPU accelerators that are at the heart of AI processing.\n\nBut management is looking to change that. According to a recent report from Nikkei Asia, Arm is now looking to design its own AI accelerators, which it will introduce in 2025. According to the report, Arm will invest heavily in initial development costs, which it should be able to bear as Arm has about $3 billion in cash on the balance sheet as well as a highly cash-generative core licensing business. The report says it will outsource production to a third-party foundry, perhaps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nSo, Nvidia will have some increased competition, which may be why Nvidia attempted to buy Arm years ago.\n\nStill, this may be a case of Arm being a bit late to the game in a crowded field. Virtually every cloud giant is now designing its own accelerators. And while Nvidia has a strong lead in \"neutral\" AI GPUs, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are each producing better and better \"neutral\" competitors.\n\nArm is 90% owned by Softbank(OTC: SFTB.Y), which is owned by the ambitious tech executive Masayoshi Son. Softbank had extended itself at the tail end of the tech-software bubble in 2021, so Arm investors must hope this isn't another example of \"me too\" thinking with a too-late entry into a red-hot tech sector. They'd be right to have mixed feelings about this week's announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle introduces new Trillium chips\n\nSpeaking of Google parent Alphabet, the search and cloud giant held its input/output (I/O) developer conference earlier this week. Unsurprisingly, there were numerous announcements related to AI, including the introduction of the aforementioned Axion CPU. But perhaps most notable on the AI chipmaking front was the announcement of Google's newest version of its tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator.\n\nGoogle has been making its TPUs since 2013 but only offers them through its Google Cloud platform. Of course, Google also has a deep stock of Nvidia chips that customers can use as well, but every cloud giant is vying for having the best low-cost alternative that's proprietary to their platform.\n\nThat's why Google's announcement of Trillium, the sixth-generation TPU accelerator, was important this week. The new chip boasts a 4.7 times performance over the prior fifth-generation chip, while being 67% more energy efficient. The new chip is also adorned with a new third-generation SparseCore accelerator, with capacity to process double the high-bandwidth memory with double the interchip-connect bandwidth. This will allow the new TPUs to process larger models. Alphabet also announced the ability to string 256 Trillium GPUs together to make a Google-powered supercomputer as well. Google, Arm, and Oracle had big AI news this week. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe new hardware will be behind a slew of new AI services Google introduced at the conference, including an update of its Gemini 1.5 pro model, the large language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. But Google also introduced new specialized models for specific-use cases, including Veo, for high-definition video, Imagen 3 for text-to-image capabilities, and AI Sandbox, a music and sound-generation tool.\n\nFinally, Google Search is also getting an AI-powered upgrade launching this coming Monday. Complex Google queries will now display AI-generated summaries and multistep plans for relevant searches. The new search summaries are good efforts by Google to avoid getting disrupted by aspiring search alternatives such as ChatGPT-powered Bing or start-ups like Perplexity.\n\nAnd recent results imply Google's AI capabilities may be gaining traction, with its cloud platform reaccelerating to a 28.4% revenue growth last quarter and Search posting impressive 14.4% in its own right even up against aspiring disruptors.\n\nOracle lands a big fish for its cloud\n\nWhen it comes to cloud infrastructure, many think of the big-three cloud platforms. But investors may not want to ignore database giant Oracle(NYSE: ORCL), which has been making efforts to fashion itself as a fourth cloud alternative. Oracle's infrastructure revenue only amounted to $1.8 billion last quarter, which was still far behind third-place Google at $9.6 billion. However, Oracle's infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenue also grew at 49%, the highest rate among cloud giants.\n\nWhile it's easier to grow off a small base, those aspirations got a big boost earlier this week. According to The Information, Elon Musk's AI start-up xAI has been discussing a deal with Oracle cloud to rent its servers for AI processing in an amount up to $10 billion over \"a number of years.\" Given that Oracle's cloud is currently on a $7.2 billion annualized run rate, that would be a big deal, making xAI one of Oracle's largest cloud customers.\n\nOne may wonder how a mere start-up can afford such largesse, but Reuters also reports that Musk's cache has led xAI to fundraising talks of up to $3 billion at an $18 billion valuation. xAI, whose chatbot Grok aims to take on Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, will have a unique angle with access to data gleaned from X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as visual data from Tesla vehicles.\n\nElon Musk has built successful businesses like Tesla and SpaceX from scratch before, although his takeover of Twitter has been much more dubious. Still, if xAI turns into a big-time LLM, it appears Oracle will reap a lot of the benefits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Time to Buy Nvidia's Stock as Q1 Earnings Approach Next Week?",
        "content": "Investors are highly anticipating Q1 earnings from Nvidia NVDA next week with the broader indexes printing fresh highs fueled by reassuring inflationary data in April.\n\nAnother quarter of monstrous growth from Nvidia could certainly propel markets higher so let’s see if it’s time to buy stock in the chip giant ahead of its Q1 results on Wednesday, May 22. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLofty Q1 Expectations\n\nThe acceleration of Nvidia’s growth and demand for its artificial intelligence chips is thought to have continued with Q1 EPS projected to soar over 400% to $5.52 versus $1.09 a share in the comparative quarter. Furthermore, the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates Nvidia could once again surpass earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q1 EPS slated at $5.68 and 3% above the current Zacks Consensus. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNvidia most recently beat the Zacks Consensus by 13% in February with Q4 EPS at $5.16 compared to estimates of $4.55 a share. Notably, Nvidia has surpassed earnings expectations for five straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 20.18% in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nOn the top line, Q1 sales are expected to increase 237% to $24.27 billion versus $7.19 billion a year ago. More impressive, Nvidia has surpassed sales estimates for 20 consecutive quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBlackwell GPU & Outlook\n\nWallstreet will be looking for updates on Nvidia’s Blackwell series of GPUs which the company says will be the highest-performance AI chips on the market ahead of its current H200 series and AMD’s AMD MI300 series. As of now, models for the Blackwell series are expected to arrive during Q4 in October or November. With a projectied price tag of $30,000-$40,000 for a single GPU, the release should start to cement projections of high double-digit top and bottom-line growth for Nvidia in its current fiscal 2025 and FY26. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nChecking Nvidia’s P/E Valuation\n\nAttributed to its growth, Nvidia’s stock has traded at a far more reasonable valuation and currently carries a 39.4X forward earnings multiple which is well below its five-year high of 122.1X and a 29% discount to the median of 55.6X.\n\nNvidia's stock also trades beneath its Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry average of 43.7X and AMD’s 47.5X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ahead of its Q1 report next week. This is attributed to Nvidia’s more reasonable P/E valuation and the fact that earnings estimate revisions have continued to rise for both its FY25 and FY26.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller. But the interesting question to answer is: Is NVIDIA really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 173\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 7th in Stanley Druckenmiller's Q1'2024 portfolio. If you want to take a look at the billionaire's top stock picks, click to see Druckenmiller's Family Office portfolio.\n\nAfter making huge profits on his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stake, which he bought in the fourth quarter of 2022, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller cut his stake in the AI chips company by 72% in the first quarter of 2024, a move that surprised many. Insider Monkey's data shows that Druckenmiller loaded up on 582,915 NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares during the fourth quarter of 2022 at an average price of $146.65 per share. Near the end of the first quarter of this year, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was hovering around $902 per share. Stanley Druckenmiller also liquidated his call options on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) which he'd bought in the fourth quarter of 2023 for $242 million.\n\nWall Street Continues to Love NVDA\n\nDespite the massive bull run in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares, Wall Street analysts are continuing to shower the stock with bullish ratings. UBS earlier this month published a list of stocks that are set to benefit from the massive surge in the AI industry, which the firm believes could touch $400 billion in revenue in the next three years. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of the list.\n\nNVDA: The Bull Case Based on Catalysts\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is continuing to refresh and update its AI chips product line as demand is skyrocketing. Analysts expect NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips and Spectrum-X platform to offer cutting-edge processing and networking solutions for companies that are making generative AI software and applications. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) bulls believe that the company's growth catalysts are strong enough to justify its currently high valuation metrics. After all NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) still enjoys an 80% market share in the GPU industry, and its products are expected to see high demand in other industries, like automotive, gaming and mobile devices.\n\nNVDA's New Customer: Elon Musk\n\nNVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) \"real world\" AI segment is thriving. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently revealed that his company currently has 35,000 H100 chips. Tesla also can become the third-biggest NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customer as the EV company plans to have 85,000 Nvidia H100 chips by the end of 2024 to train its AI models.\n\nStory continues\n\nValuation Concerns and Risks\n\nHowever, some circles have voiced concerns on NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation following the eye-popping stock price gains NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has enjoyed over the past few months. This comes as major NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Google begin to mull producing AI chips in-house. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also outsourcing its production to Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) vulnerable to any geopolitical risks especially when President Biden is upping the ante against China with new traffics and hawkish tone.\n\nWolfe Research in recently replaced Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with its competitor AMD in its Alpha List. Wolfe Research cited NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) massive stock price gains year to date as a reason behind this move.\n\nHedge Fund Sentiment on NVDA\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 173 funds had stakes in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Druckenmiller wasn't the only hedge fund manager who reduced his stake in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) after enjoying massive stock price gains. Insider Monkey's data shows Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group, Donald Sussman's Paloma Partners and Paul Tudor Jones' Tudor Investment Corp decreased their stakes in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) by more than 70% each in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nIs Nvidia The Best AI Stock Pick of Stanley Druckenmiller?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is not the best AI stock pick of Stanely Druckenmiller, based on Insider Monkey's research.\n\nClick to see Stanley Druckenmiller's 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy That are Better that Nvidia.\n\nDisclosure:None\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Just because an investment is obvious doesn't mean it's wrong. Here are three businesses that are clear leaders in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which could eclipse $1.8 trillion by the end of the decade. That's up from roughly $280 billion today, according to Grand View Research.\n\nWith so much AI-fueled growth still to come, all three of these stocks are terrific buys right now.\n\nNo. 1 AI stock to buy: Nvidia\n\nAstute investors have named Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) as one of the prime beneficiaries of the AI gold rush, and they're right to do so. The semiconductor colossus designs state-of-the-art chips that make the most advanced AI applications possible. Nvidia's AI-related sales and profits, in turn, are growing like gangbusters.\n\nNvidia's growth is breathtaking. Its revenue rocketed 126% to $61 billion in its 2024 fiscal year, which ended on Jan. 28. That helped to drive its net profits higher by a dazzling 286% to $32 billion.\n\nThe market for AI chips is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years. Tech leaders like Alphabet are investing aggressively to expand their cloud computing networks. At the same time, companies like Tesla are buying massive amounts of Nvidia's latest chips to power their AI initiatives. Demand for chips that accelerate AI workloads in data centers could soar nearly ninefold to $400 billion by 2027, according to Advanced Micro Devices' CEO Lisa Su.\n\nWith its new Blackwell processors slated to provide more powerful performance gains, Nvidia's innovative chip designs should remain the first choice for AI-focused buyers.\n\nNo. 2 AI stock to buy: Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nChip designers like Nvidia and AMD rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) to fabricate their designs. The global leader in semiconductor foundry services makes many of the crucial electronic components that are helping to power the AI revolution.\n\nMore than 500 companies asked TSMC to build nearly 12,000 different products in 2023. Key end markets include smartphones, automotive technology, and consumer electronics.\n\nYet, it's TSMC's AI-driven opportunities that have investors most excited. The company's net revenue in April surged by 60% year over year to 236 billion New Taiwan dollars, or roughly $7.3 billion, fueled by soaring demand for AI-related semiconductor technologies. That marked a sharp acceleration from TSMC's sales growth rates of 34% in March and 11% in February.\n\nInvestors can expect these strong growth trends to persist. Eager to ensure access to TSMC's advanced technology, governments are offering the chipmaker billions of dollars of tax breaks to erect new manufacturing plants within their borders. TSMC is thus planning to open additional facilities in the U.S., Japan, and Germany to expand its AI chipmaking empire.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo. 3 AI stock to buy: Microsoft\n\nA multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT-creator OpenAI thrust Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to the forefront of the AI race. That's an extremely valuable position to be in, as evidenced by the tech behemoth's $3 trillion market value.\n\nMicrosoft is using OpenAI's technology to bolster its own AI offerings. Businesses can access ChatGPT and other large language models via Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform. Revenue for Azure and the company's other cloud services leaped 31% in the quarter ended March 31, boosted by rising demand for AI tools.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is adding AI assistants called \"copilots\" to its popular productivity software. Users are reporting significant productivity and efficiency gains, including more than one hour of time savings per week on work-related tasks.\n\nMicrosoft is just beginning to monetize its AI copilots. Yet nearly 60% of the 500 biggest businesses in the U.S. are already testing these promising AI tools. With copilot subscription plans starting at $30 per month per user, the tech giant has an opportunity to enlarge its profits by selling these AI upgrades to the over 400 million commercial users of its Office 365 software suite.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Small-Cap Growth Opportunities in the AI Era",
        "content": "It’s certainly a very good time to be in the AI business. After all, the technology has been getting huge amounts of positive publicity since December 2022, and it’s being viewed as a powerful, helpful tool for humans. As a result, many AI stocks, such as Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), SoundhoundAI (NASDAQ:SOUN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), have skyrocketed. But there are still a multitude of small-cap AI stocks that are laboring in obscurity. These firms have all the advantages of being involved in AI, but their stocks do not yet come close to reflecting their tremendous potential. Here are three small-cap growth stocks to buy.\n\nInnodata (INOD) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nInnodata (NASDAQ:INOD) uses data sets to train AI models for other firms. Innodata also helps businesses direct their AI models to perform certain tasks. Additionally, the firm digitalizes medical records and provides a marketing platform.\n\nMany large companies, including IBM (NYSE:IBM), Palantir and Accenture (NYSE:ACN), are helping firms implement AI. But my sense is that Innodata is more technical and enables more detailed capabilities than many of these firms. Moreover, Innodata, which was founded back in 1988, is largely dedicated to AI and likely has much more experience with the technology than many if not most of its competitors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast quarter, the firm’s top line jumped 41% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.5 million. Its EBITDA, excluding certain items, came in at $3.8 million, up from $800,000 in Q1 of 2023.\n\nInvestor’s Business Daily gives INOD stock an Accumulation/Distribution grade of B. That’s a high grade for a small-cap stock and indicates that many institutional investors are starting to buy INOD stock.\n\nGiven the firm’s strong outlook and powerful growth, along with the Street’s interest in the name, INOD stock is one of the top small-cap growth stocks to buy.\n\nMitek Systems (MITK) A concept image of a person touching a hologram fingerprint\n\nSource: Alexander Supertramp/Shutterstock.com\n\nMitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) provides identity software that utilizes AI. Currently, its technology is used to enable consumers to deposit checks with their smartphones and to detect check fraud. However, given increases in online fraud and continuous advances in AI, along with increased interest in the technology, I expect Mitek to use its technology to introduce new, highly successful products over the longer term. Indeed, the firm has developed voice authentication technology that it says “opens up several new avenues for growth. “\n\nDuring Mitek’s FY that ended in September 2023, its revenue came in at $172.6 million, up from $144.8 million during the previous fiscal year. Additionally, it generated operating income of $21.1 million. up from $15.7 million during the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMitek has a low forward price-earnings ratio of 14.4 times.\n\niCAD (ICAD) an image of a microscope, NEXI stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\niCAD’s (NASDAQ:ICAD) products utilize AI to more accurately detect breast cancer. Last quarter, the company’s sales team began systematically using lead generation programs for the first time and added four new sales representatives to its team which had previously utilized six sales representatives. Additionally, in December, the firm added a new head of North American sales in December. Finally, iCAD worked harder to obtain more revenue from its existing customers.\n\nThe changes enabled iCAD to grow very rapid as its revenue climbed 14% last quarter versus the same period earlier to $4.95 million. Making the gain even more impressive, iCAD had divested its cancer therapy business, Xoft, at the end of last year.\n\nAlso impressively, the firm made significant, new deals last quarter with entities in Turkey, Israel, Serbia and France in Q1. These contracts indicate that the company can generate meaningful revenue going forward from countries outside of North America.\n\nI believe that iCAD’s current market capitalization of $43 million is many times below its long-term potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in ICAD.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before May 22?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been unstoppable over the past few years, thanks to the company's key role in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant makes graphics processing units (GPUs) that power crucial AI tasks, such as the training and inferencing of large language models. Then these models go on to do their job of completing complex tasks. Nvidia holds 80% of the AI chip market because its GPUs are the fastest around, and that's translated into explosive earnings performance.\n\nThe company's quarterly earnings have surpassed analysts' estimates in at least the past four quarters. And revenue and net income have climbed in the triple and even quadruple digits in recent quarters -- well into the billions of dollars. So it's no surprise the stock has soared more than 200% over the past year.\n\nConsidering all of this, should you rush out to buy Nvidia stock before its May 22 earnings report? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's transition from gaming to AI\n\nFirst, here's a look at Nvidia's earnings path so far. A few years back, the company generated most of its revenue from the video game industry, with the GPU bringing games to life on the screen. But the GPU's ability to process multiple tasks at a time made it clear that this chip could score a big win in other industries, too. Nvidia created CUDA, a parallel computing platform that brings the GPU to general computing -- and that opened the door to AI.\n\nSince then, Nvidia has progressively grown revenue from its data center business -- which includes its AI offerings -- and this now represents the company's biggest source of growth and revenue. In the most recent quarter, data center revenue soared more than 400% year over year to a record $18.4 billion. That's on total revenue of about $22 billion (also a record) and significantly more than gaming revenue of $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to GPUs, Nvidia offers a wide range of products and services, including a growing cloud software platform that streamlines the development of a company's AI applications. Potential customers can gain access to all of this through the world's major cloud providers -- so it's easy for a business to learn about what Nvidia has to offer and get started.\n\nNvidia versus the competition\n\nIt's true that Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, which both have announced new high-performing chips in recent times. Intel even said its latest innovation -- the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator -- beat the performance and price of Nvidia's H100.\n\nStory continues\n\nPartners also are challenging Nvidia. For example, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS), sells Nvidia products and its own in-house developed training and inference chips.\n\nThese players probably will gain some market share, but Nvidia still has what it takes to dominate the market and keep those looking for a premium chip coming back. This is due to the company's first-to-market advantage, along with its reputation for top performance and ongoing innovation.\n\nLater this year, the company plans to release its Blackwell architecture, including six new technologies -- and this includes the most powerful chip yet. Even though competition may be getting tougher, it's not likely to unseat Nvidia.\n\nNow let's take a look at what to expect from the company's earnings report next week. Earlier, Nvidia forecast first-quarter 2025 revenue of about $24 billion, which represents an increase of more than 200% year over year. The GAAP gross margin forecast of 76.3% also shows a great leap from the prior period, when GAAP gross margin was 64.6%.\n\nOne factor that may represent a headwind is the U.S. government's restriction on sales of AI chips to China. Nvidia has designed a new chip to fit government specifications, but it's not yet clear if such a product will take off.\n\nIs Nvidia a buy?\n\nLet's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia before the May 22 earnings report? Not necessarily.\n\nAs a long-term investor, you won't gain or lose much if Nvidia shares make even a double-digit move following the report. This sort of move won't stand out in the performance of Nvidia stock over five or 10 years -- your minimum holding period. This is great because it takes the pressure off ahead of events such as earnings reports and means you don't have to rush into an investing decision.\n\nThat said, I'm optimistic about Nvidia's future, thanks to its solid market position, its focus on innovation, and the fact that the general AI story is in its early days. It's a great idea to buy Nvidia -- before or after May 22.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investors are growing increasingly skeptical about owning AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) stock, a Mizuho desk analyst highlighted in a new note.\n\n“Why add AMD if I own NVDA and AVGO here that are cheaper and feel much lower risk?” appears to be the key pushback among market participants, the analyst said.\n\nThe chipmaker’s shares rose to an intraday high of $168 on Thursday, amid a broader surge in the technology sector driven by the recently released softer-than-expected inflation data.\n\nIt seemed like a short squeeze was affecting much of the tech market, the analyst noted. Notably, AMD’s chipmaking peer Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology was up 6-7% at one point despite the lack of any specific news or events.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD remains a significant short position for many East Coast hedge funds, and numerous long-only (LO) investors are steering clear of it ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell launch later this year.\n\n“Stock feels like a plane crash survivor on a life raft in middle of a massive ocean just looking for land,” the analyst wrote.\n\n“I remain a bull and love the risk reward if you have patience and duration (think 6-9 months). But I get the worry, hesitancy and concerns amongst investors.”\n\nMizuho’s expert also said that AMD “could be the next Dell (NYSE:DELL),” another major hedge fund short that surged on a bullish preview from Morgan Stanley ahead of their earnings at the end of May.\n\nMeanwhile, new reports suggest that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to promote AMD's MI300X GPUs for generative AI at their upcoming Build conference. While it’s known that Microsoft uses AMD's MI300 GPUs to balance Nvidia, recent negative calls in March and April implied that Microsoft was cutting orders to shift funds to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs, set for release later this year.\n\n“I would watch AMD today, and while this MSFT news itself is unlikely some major catalyst, any focus by MSFT on AMD’s MI300 next week to me feels like a positive catalyst as the cons view is MSFT will cut MI300 orders this yr and AMD will miss MI300 rev bogeys of $9-10B next yr,” the analyst concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHere's why investors seem to be hesitant to own AMD stock: Mizuho\n\nIntel's AI traction slow but improving: Deutsche Bank\n\nUS stocks largely flat, but set to end the week with gains; Reddit soars\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWith the Dow (^DJI) touching 40,000 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) near new records as well, investors might be looking for the next catalyst to continue to juice the rally.\n\nJust in time, chipmaking juggernaut Nvidia comes a-calling. The company’s report is way at the end of the regular earnings season — nearly a month after Meta’s.\n\nAnd Nvidia’s results have only grown in importance as the company’s value has ballooned.\n\nIts market cap is $2.3 trillion, and it’s now the third-weightiest stock in the S&P 500 behind Microsoft and Apple. In what might be termed the Nvidia-verse, a whole host of semiconductor companies that either compete with or service Nvidia rise or fall with its shares.\n\nSpeaking of its shares, their performance has left the other so-called Magnificent Seven stocks in the dust this year. (I know, I know, we’re not even calling them that anymore.) But after climbing an eye-watering 240% last year, Nvidia is on its way to doubling again thus far in 2024, making it the third-best gainer in the S&P 500. (It’s behind Super Micro, another AI play, and Vistra, a power provider also riding the AI demand wave.)\n\nSo the pressure, once again, is on. While another big beat might push stocks up, a miss could do the opposite.\n\nAnd analysts, by and large, think Nvidia can meet or beat those lofty expectations. Revenue is forecast to have grown by 242% last quarter— and that follows three quarters of triple-digit percentage year-over-year sales increases.\n\nTaking a step back, Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar pointed out in an earnings preview note that data center chips and software — largely fueled by the demand for AI training — accounted for 83% of revenues last quarter.\n\nFive years ago, Nvidia’s market cap was under $100 billion and it was primarily known for making video game chips before catching the crypto-mining wave (a walk down memory lane prompted by my co-anchor Josh Lipton). The transformation has been extraordinary. And it was even our Company of the Year in 2016.\n\nThis quarter may not blow expectations out of the water, especially considering how much the stock has rallied. Kumar writes that even if the company’s revenue beats by $1.9 billion — following the trend of recent quarters — the stock will be “flat to up.” Citi’s Atif Malik writes, “We expect smaller beats vs. the prior few quarters on larger numbers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it’s John Vinh of KeyBanc who really got my attention with yet another huge number. He expects data center revenue to climb to $200 billion in calendar 2025. That would represent a 321% increase over 2023.\n\nLet’s put in perspective how unusual it is for a company this large to grow by that much. Tesla sales rose by 387% in 2013 — to just over $2 billion. Amazon hasn’t seen triple-digit growth since 1998, when revenue grew by 313% to $610 million.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia’s size relative to growth is nearly without precedent.\n\nThat’s why, as the stock keeps climbing, investors keep asking, “How long can this last?” morning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks to buy: it’s the answer to the question, what do artificial intelligence, the 5G rollout, the Internet of Things (IoT) and a host of other innovations have in common?\n\nLet’s get down to it. Semiconductors represent the building blocks of technology. While the focus in the market tends to be on the front-facing innovation such as generative AI, none of the innovations that we gawk over would be possible without semiconductors.\n\nAnd yes, certain semiconductors get the lion’s share of the attention, like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, this space is so much more than just NVDA. With that in mind, below are intriguing semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Geneva, Switzerland, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) – better known as simply ST – isn’t exactly a household name in most parts of the world. Chances are, however, you’ve been positively impacted by the company’s products. ST along with its subsidiaries designs, develops, manufactures and distributes semiconductor products. Specifically, it specializes in integrated circuits (ICs) that serve as the backdrop for myriad systems and applications.\n\nIn other words, if you’ve used a modern appliance or driven a contemporary vehicle, there’s a good chance that ST was involved in some of the tech interfaces. Thanks to the broad relevancies, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with an average price target of $48. That implies 12% upside, with the most optimistic target rising to $55 or more than 28% up from the time of writing.\n\nTo be fair, for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate a slowdown. Earnings per share could come down to $2.15 while the top line could slip to $14.36 billion. Last year, the results stood at EPS of $4.46 on sales of $17.29 billion. However, fiscal 2025 could start a recovery, with EPS moving to $2.97 on revenue of $16.12 billion.\n\nFor patient investors, STM could be one of the semiconductor stocks to buy.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Wilmington, Delaware, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) might not be a standout name among semiconductor stocks to buy. While it’s not getting the recognition of an Nvidia, Marvell offers significant pertinence to data infrastructure solutions. Its offerings span from the datacenter core to network edge computing. Specifically, the company specializes in System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architectures, integrating analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing functionality.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Mordor Intelligence, the SoC market will reach a valuation of $1272.65 billion in 2024. By 2029, this segment could rise to $253.8 billion. If so, it would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just over 8%. Financially, Marvell attracts prudent investors for its consistent earnings performances. In the prior fiscal year (2024), the company’s average quarterly surprise came out to 3.13%.\n\nFor the current year (fiscal 2025), analysts see a down year, with EPS to $1.46 on sales of $5.4 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $1.51 with a top line of $5.51 billion. However, in fiscal 2026, EPS could fly to $2.45 on revenue of $7.05 billion. Therefore, MRVL could rank among the semiconductor stocks to buy for patient investors.\n\nSemtech (SMTC) SMTC stock: The Semtech logo on a sign outside its building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in Camarillo, California, Semtech (NASDAQ:SMTC) designs, develops, manufactures and markets analog and mixed-signal semiconductors and advanced algorithms. According to its corporate profile, Semtech provides signal integrity products. These include a portfolio of optical data communications and video transport products used in various infrastructure and industrial applications. Further, the company offers a portfolio of ICs for data centers, enterprise networks and passive optical networks.\n\nTo be sure, SMTC stock has been on the move. Since the start of the year, the security rocketed higher to nearly 85%. Over the past 52 weeks, the market value has more than doubled. As a result, the average price target of $39.61 among analysts represents a 1% downside. However, keep in mind that Semtech commands a unanimous strong buy rating. Further, the high-side target hits $50, implying 25% upside potential.\n\nFor the current fiscal year (2025), experts only project modest top-line growth to $874.98 million. Last year, the company generated sales of $868.76 million. However, in the following year, Semtech might post sales of $1.03 billion, up 18.1% from projected fiscal ’24 sales.\n\nThis could be one of the semiconductor stocks to buy, even with the already-outstanding performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Bull of the Day: Super Micro Computer (SMCI)",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) reported their March quarterly earnings on April 30 and inspired analysts to once again boost growth estimates for the provider of key datacenter infrastructure in the early innings of the AI boom.\r\n\r\nAfter SMCI delivered strong numbers and guidance, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year (ends June) rose 6% from $22.15 to $23.51, representing 99% annual growth.\r\n\r\nAnd next fiscal year jumped over 17% from $28.95 to $34, which would equate to a 44.6% advance.\r\n\r\nThese rising profits are being drawn from equally impressive growth on the topline, with the current year approaching a 110% leap to nearly $15 billion and next year's projections are stalking $24 billion for another 60% surge.\r\n\r\nI Remember Ye Yay High\r\n\r\nAs a devoted NVIDIA (NVDA) investor, I like to remind others that \"as goes GPU demand, so goes datacenter build-out.\" And just as investors continue to doubt NVIDIA's growth as having any sustainability, so too they miss its little satellites profiting from the boom.\r\n\r\nIt seems it was only a few months ago when SMCI was a $300 stock. That's because it was only 4 months ago when, in late January, the company pre-announced December quarter results and the stock launched 36% the next day.\r\n\r\nI first wrote about the \"shock and awe\" of a datacenter architect most investors had never heard of in my Bull of the Day from January 28. Here's some of what I shared...\r\n\r\nThey call themselves \"Supermicro\" and describe their business simply and powerfully...\r\n\r\nSupermicro is a global technology leader committed to delivering first-to-market innovation for Enterprise, Cloud, AI, Metaverse, and 5G Telco/Edge IT Infrastructure. We are a Rack-Scale Total IT Solutions provider that designs and builds an environmentally-friendly and energy-saving portfolio of servers, storage systems, switches, software, along with global support services.\r\n\r\nAnd on January 19 they stunned Wall Street with preliminary revenue of $3.6 billion, which tore through prior guidance of $2.7-2.9 billion, representing 100% year-over-year growth for the company's fiscal Q2.\r\n\r\nEarnings for the quarter are projected to spike to $5.55 a share, topping analysts estimates of $4.50 EPS.\r\n\r\nThe company cited strong market and end customer demand for its rack-scale, AI and Total IT Solutions.\r\n\r\nFor its current fiscal year which ends in June, Supermicro is on pace to deliver 53% topline growth to nearly $11 billion and 40% EPS growth to cross $16.50.\r\n\r\nAnd even after the huge rally in SMCI shares this month, with projected 15% revenue growth to cross $12.5 billion next year the stock still trades at only 2 times sales!\r\n\r\n(end of excerpt from my Jan 28 article)\r\n\r\nAI Boom, or AI Bubble?\r\n\r\nWhat should jump out is that less than four months ago we were talking about $11 billion and $12.5 billion on the Supermicro toplines for this year and next. Now those numbers are $15 billion and $24 billion!\r\n\r\nAnd the stock still trades for 2X sales as I talked about in my video from May 7, where I also discuss SMCI volatility since the surge to $1,200 as investors debate whether or not this is all just an \"AI bubble.\"\r\n\r\nIn that video, I explain why SMCI dropped 23% on April 19. The reason revolves around expectations for another stunner preannounce (like in January) that didn't come. So expectations and fears clashed as hopes were dashed.\r\n\r\nBut I also said the storm is over, estimates are still rising, and investors should be looking to buy under $800. You got two more chances this week.\r\n\r\nBe sure to watch the 7-minute video to see the key price support level that held after earnings and gave way to a 16% rally on May 15 to $950.\r\n\r\nWith NVIDIA earnings on deck May 22, we can look forward to another set of data points about the AI debate. My bet is that both NVDA and SMCI will be trading above $1,000 very soon as the boom continues and the bulls win.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I own shares of NVDA and SMCI for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Markets are hoping for evidence that will solidify a brightening global economic outlook, though rising trade tensions are casting a cloud, while G7 finance ministers gather in Italy.\n\nAI darling Nvidia reports results, London has its sights on a revival in stock listings, while New Zealand's central bank is stuck in rut between lacklustre growth and sticky inflation.\n\nHere's your look at what's happening in markets this coming week from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Lewis Krauskopf in New York, and Anousha Sakoui, Dhara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.\n\n1/ CLOUDS ON HORIZON\n\nUpcoming May business activity numbers from big economies should reinforce a brighter global economic outlook.\n\nA slow euro area recovery appears to be underway after six straight quarters of stagnant or negative growth, U.S. inflation just resumed its downward trend and China grew faster than expected in Q1. So, global PMIs should stay on the right side of the 50 divider between expansion and contraction.\n\nYet steep U.S. tariff increases on Chinese imports from electric vehicle batteries to computer chips highlight a fragile outlook for global trade and growth. China vows retaliation.\n\nManufacturers in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, are already experiencing shifts in world trade and geopolitics. Heightened trade tensions - with a U.S. election looming - could hurt them further, upend China's recovery and reignite U.S. inflation.\n\nGlobal PMIs are pointing up for now. But that could easily change.\n\n2/ CHIP TIME\n\nNvidia's quarterly results on Wednesday could set the tone for U.S. stock markets and reverberate through companies exposed to the burgeoning artificial intelligence field.\n\nThe semiconductor company at the center of the excitement over AI's business potential is expected to report a massive jump in revenue and profit for its fiscal first quarter.\n\nRevenue is expected to rise to $24.8 billion, from $7.2 billion a year earlier, with earnings per share soaring to $5.57 from $1.09, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia may need to meet those lofty expectations and then some to keep its soaring stock price moving higher. Shares have jumped over 90% this year after more than tripling in 2023, making the AI darling the third-largest U.S. company by market value.\n\n3/ SHEIN AND SPARKLE\n\nReports on the diminished status of London's stock market have been aplenty: Europe's most popular listing venue during the 2021 boom has been home to just 1% of all European IPO volumes year-to-date, according to Dealogic.\n\nCould this be about to change? A string of household names have emerged as potential London listing contenders.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese fast fashion brand Shein is stepping up preparations for a potential London float that could be the venue's largest ever if its valued at $66 billion. Diamond firm De Beers is another that might bring some sparkle.\n\nA positive driver is the improved global fund flows.\n\n4/ WATCH, WORRY AND WAIT\n\nThe central bank that was at the forefront of monetary policy shifts globally has been forced to take a back seat in bringing interest rates down from painful multi-year peaks.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand, expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday for a seventh consecutive meeting, was the first major monetary authority to ease at the start of the pandemic, and the first to hike in the aftermath.\n\nBut sticky inflation and a flatlining economy keeps the RBNZ in the \"watch, worry and wait\" stance it adopted a year ago.\n\nMarket wagers for an eventual cut in October put it behind the ECB which is expected to move in June, followed by the BoE in August and the U.S. Fed in September. Switzerland and Sweden have started easing.\n\nThe RBNZ itself is even less optimistic, projecting no lowering of rates until next year.\n\n5/ FROZEN ASSETS\n\nFinance chiefs from the Group of Seven major democracies will back a European Union plan to use the income from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine's war effort at a May 24-25 meeting, according to Italy, which holds the rotating presidency of the group.\n\nThe prospect of more funding potentially in the near future comes at a critical time for Ukraine, which faces a new Russian offensive in the north eastern Kharkiv region.\n\nThe G7 froze some $300 billion worth of financial assets soon after Moscow's attack on its neighbour in February 2022 - and has debated since then whether and how to use the funds to help Ukraine. While Washington has proposed seizing the assets in their entirety, Europe has balked at that push, citing risks to the euro and legal repercussions.\n\nItaly has said it will also try to revive an international deal on how to share taxing rights on large corporations which the United States is struggling to ratify in Congress.\n\n(Graphics by Pasit Kongkunakornkul, Kripa Jayaram, Sumanta Sen, Prinz Magtulis and Riddhima Talwani, compiled by Karin Strohecker; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia earnings preview: Here's what Citi, Piper Sandler analysts expect to see",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to report its fiscal first-quarter 2025 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, May 22.\n\nInvestors will be mainly focusing on growth trends in Nvidia’s data center segment and any updates on the recently announced Blackwell platform.\n\nWall Street analysts project Nvidia's revenue to reach $24.65 billion for Q1 FY2025, up from the previous quarter and more than tripling from the year-ago period, according to consensus estimates by Visible Alpha.\n\nNet income is expected to soar to $12.87 billion, notably higher than the $2.04 billion profit recorded a year ago and up from the final quarter of FY2024. On a per-share basis, diluted earnings are anticipated to be $5.17, a sharp increase from 82 cents in the year-ago period.\n\nHowever, a key focus in Nvidia's upcoming earnings report will be its data center segment. Nvidia has positioned itself as an early beneficiary of the AI boom, leading to rapid growth in this division. The unprecedented demand for Nvidia's advanced computing chips, which are specialized for running AI workloads, has significantly driven this expansion.\n\nCiti analysts project Nvidia's April quarter total and data center sales to be $24 billion and $21 billion, respectively, in line with expectations. They believe buy-side estimates are higher at approximately $26 billion for total sales and $23 billion for data center sales.\n\nFor the July quarter, Citi models total sales of $27.5 billion, compared to the Street's estimate of $26.5 billion and buy-side expectations of around $28 billion.\n\n“We expect smaller beats vs the prior few quarters on larger numbers, shorter H100 lead times, and gross margin normalization before GB200 volume ramps in 1H25,” analysts at the Wall Street giant said in a note.\n\n“Going into earnings, we believe investors are focused on a) GB200 ramp/pipeline, b) potential air pocket in AI demand in 2H24, c) B200’s impact on LT gross margins, d) power constraints on AI data center rollouts, and e) sovereign AI&China H20 demand,” they added.\n\nMeanwhile, in their pre-earnings report, Piper Sandler analysts said they continue to see strong demand for Nvidia’s data center products and believe the company is poised for another “beat-and-raise quarter.”\n\n“Demand for Hopper GPUs remains strong with supply still working to catch up to demand as the product is still on allocation. Our checks indicate that demand for the Blackwell GPU series is also set to be strong across NVDA’s data center customer base,” they noted.\n\nIn terms of results, Piper Sandler's bull case suggests that Nvidia's total revenues could surpass current expectations by $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion for April, with a similar beat anticipated for July. Should that happen, the investment firm expects Nvidia stock to be flat or slightly up after the print’s release due to high investor expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings preview: Here's what Citi, Piper Sandler analysts expect to see\n\nDaimler Truck and Volvo intend to form software joint venture\n\nExclusive-Musk pushes plan for China data to power Tesla's AI ambitions\n\nView comments",

        "title": "From Hype to Bust: The Downfall of Teladoc, Bark and Nike Stocks",
        "content": "Finding stocks to sell in 2024 is straightforward, but actually executing those trades is another matter. As always, bearish sentiment surrounds the Magnificent Seven as the S&P 500 hits all-time highs despite sweeping tech layoffs and overall economic unease. Sure, you could short a stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to massive overvaluation. But ask the thousands of traders who tried that over the past year, only to see the stock consistently climb higher, how well that worked out. It isn’t enough to be right — you must have the right timing, too. Regardless, many of these stocks to sell have lost almost all hope.\n\nInstead, if you’re looking for stocks to sell in 2024, focus on those that are materially overvalued and facing stronger headwinds than others in their market or sector. These three stocks span sectors as diverse as consumer goods, MedTech, and apparel. What do they have in common? They’re at the top of the list of stocks to sell today.\n\nStocks to Sell: Teladoc Health (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce upon a time, I was particularly bullish on Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC). While the central thesis stands — like remote work, remote medicine trends will only accelerate — I’m sad to say that Teladoc may not have what it takes to keep the lights on. You’ve doubtlessly heard of last month’s events, which saw (former) CEO Jason Gorevic leave the organization suddenly and unexpectedly, leaving the firm rudderless. But the problems go far further than just executive mismanagement.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite telehealth trends largely accelerating, even post-pandemic, Teladoc couldn’t keep up. Though revenue ticked up a hair in the most recent earnings report, its net loss widened by nearly 20%. A fair amount of that larger net loss came from stock-based compensation, totaling $46 million or $0.42 per share. While it’s reasonable to look at this as a one-time event and an anomaly with limited impact moving forward, Teladoc has always enthusiastically offered staff stock-based compensation and I fear they won’t attract strong executive talent without a hefty options package. From an optimistic outlook, this would encourage Gorevic’s replacement to right the ship and maximize shareholder (and his) value. While that may come to pass, I wouldn’t bet on it — especially considering Teladoc is rapidly losing market share and massively edged out by major players like Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\nBark (BARK) Bark, the parent company of BarkBox, distribution center. BarkBox is a monthly subscription service providing dog products.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSubscription-based pet stock Bark (NYSE:BARK) fell victim to the SPAC-mania hype, with its value now a fraction of its pre-merger high. Before its merger, the soon-to-be-BARK SPAC traded north of $15 for months before plummeting post-merger into penny stock territory.\n\nToday, investors recognize the grim reality of Bark’s financials and weak value proposition, leading to a loss of confidence. Some still cling to the false hope that Bark remains a viable option instead of a stock to sell, but that perspective is increasingly tenuous.\n\nBark’s flagship product, BarkBox, performs best when households have ample discretionary income. That, of course, isn’t the case today as US household savings rates sit at multi-decade lows. This misalignment resulted in steadily declining sales over recent quarters. Bark has never turned a profit, a major red flag for investors in today’s financial climate. The fascination with potential long-term growth without a solid fundamental foundation no longer attracts investors as it did in 2021, making Bark a prime example of a stock whose valuation escalated too quickly and then plummeted.\n\nThe company narrowly avoided forced delisting from major exchanges in March, but I don’t expect this growth stock to last much longer — best to sell while you still can.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) stock has underperformed the broader market, losing more than 20% over the past year and 14% since January. Despite this decline, shares remain overvalued, trading at nearly 25x earnings and 10x book value. This follows a disappointing March earnings report, with expenses ballooning 7% despite December 2023 promises to cut more than $2 billion in overall costs.\n\nThose cost-cutting initiatives don’t seem to be in play yet, which points to further trouble ahead for Nike. Many of these cuts will likely come from payroll, which brings its own set of problems. Indicators suggest Nike could pay up to $450 million in severance over the next few years as part of sweeping layoffs to save money long-term. And, of course, mass layoffs often signal deeper issues ahead.\n\nConsumers are no longer as enamored with Nike products as they once were. Affordable alternatives abound and tightened household budgets limit overspending on luxury sports apparel, which is Nike’s core offering. A possible shift to value pricing could further erode Nike’s brand clout, potentially proving detrimental in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges",
        "content": "An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.\n\nFor instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.\n\nWhen people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.\n\nThat said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.\n\nNvidia Is the New Gold\n\nOne of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.\n\nEven in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.\n\nIn the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.\n\nSurvey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.\n\nThree years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.\n\nInvesting in Farmlands\n\nInstitutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE:FPI) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ:LAND).\n\nFarmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.\n\nFarmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.\n\nFarmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.\n\nAlthough investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.\n\nPut Up a Chicken Wings Business\n\nChicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.\n\nRetail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.\n\nMoreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.\n\nFabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.\n\nAdditionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.\n\nCommon inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Quantum computing has the potential to usher in a new era of computing power. While the market is still digesting the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they have yet to focus in on the next big discovery.\n\nRemarkably, quantum computers have the ability to perform optimization and predictive tasks faster than conventional computers. They do require a load of capital to build and maintain. So only a select few public companies in the market specialize in this field.\n\nAs U.S. equities remain rather volatile, it’s probably best to stay away from small-cap pure-play quantum computing stock. Why? Their ability to generate profits for shareholders is still up in the air. So, let’s examine larger tech companies that have made significant strides in developing quantum computers. And the icing on the cake is, Wall Street is optimistic about all of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for software giant and household name, Google. Having already written about Alphabet stock in the past, I’m still bullish on the company’s share price. It trades at a 21.9x forward earnings, which is lower than competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the tech giant has many tailwinds guiding its rise, including advanced computing technologies.\n\nIn fact, Google has been developing quantum computing technology for well over a decade now. Sycamore is the name of Google’s quantum computer gem. This quantum system has 70 qubits, which is higher than a prior version of the computer. Similar to normal bytes, qubits can be in a state of 0 or 1. However, they can be in these states simultaneously, endowing them with more processing power than a normal computer.\n\nAccording to Koyfin, Google has 59 Wall Street analysts covering its shares, and 48 of them have given the stock a strong buy or buy rating.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nImpressively, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have soared well over 200% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe reason? The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The chipmaker is the key provider of advanced chips that power large-language models for training AI chatbots. Nvidia’s state-of-the-art Blackwell chips will develop improved AI models for both businesses and consumers. In addition to its lead in AI processing power, Nvidia is paving the way for quantum computers.\n\nFurther, Nvidia has developed an open-source platform dubbed CUDA-Q. It allows quantum computing scientists to program and integrate quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical computing systems like GPUs and CPUs. The influence of Nvidia’s quantum computing platform goes beyond quantum computing systems in the U.S. In fact, national research centers in Germany, Japan and Poland are relying upon Nvidia’s open-source programming system to create their own quantum computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, as AI takes the forefront of the NVDA stock discussion, investors should also consider the chipmaker’s foray into quantum computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another legacy tech business that has dipped more than one toe in the quantum computing space.\n\nIBM has been pursuing quantum computing research since the early 2000s. And the company’s desire to stay at the forefront of research in the field has not abated. Last year, IBM seemed to have extended its lead in quantum computing processors. The release of the Condor system took the market by storm. This quantum processor has 1,121 superconducting qubits, rendering it the largest quantum computing chip that has been developed.\n\nHowever, not all the news is positive. IBM has suffered with sluggish growth over the past few years. The uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment certainly has not helped. Nevertheless, quantum computing could prove to be an important growth lever for the business. IBM trades at 17.0x forward earnings and has received a couple of strong buy ratings from Wall Street firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "The tech sector is one of the hottest sectors of the economy right now, and it can impact the overall market sentiment. With strong earnings reports, several tech stocks were up and this benefited many others. Similarly, the upcoming Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings are expected to benefit the entire market and could take other tech stocks higher. The future is Artificial Intelligence, and there is no stopping its momentum. Smart investors are always on the watch out for AI stocks to buy.\n\nSeveral companies are highly regarded in the industry for their AI investments, and they have seen the top and bottom line improve over the past 12 months. There are AI stocks with ample upside potential, and if you want to join the hype, here are the three stocks with strong buy ratings to consider. Yes, analyst ratings aren’t certain and things do not always go as expected. However, there is a strong chance of an upside for these three stocks mentioned here. Let’s look at the three options.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll eyes are on Nvidia this month as the company is set to report the first-quarter results next week. A standout winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) race so far, there is no other company that can come close to its market domination right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrading at $946 today, NVDA stock has enjoyed a massive rally and is up 96% year-to-date. I’d recommended the stock when it was trading at $178 in 2023, and if you had bought it then, you’d be sitting on incredible gains today.\n\nNvidia is still a buy before the company reports results because the stock had rallied after the results, and it could happen again. The management is aiming for a revenue of $24.0 billion, up from $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts are pounding the table on Nvidia stock because there is an expectation that the results will boost the stock.\n\nWith its massive market share and the growing demand for AI chips, Nvidia is set to rule in 2024. Wells Fargo has a price target of $1,150 for the share and considers the earnings as a catalyst for the company. HSBC has a buy rating with a price target of $1,350 while Jefferies has a price target of $1,200 with a buy rating.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a highly-overlooked AI stock that is slowly making big moves. Up 16% YTD, ORCL stock is exchanging hands for $121 as of writing. The company’s generative AI is leading cloud infrastructure. It saw a 25% YOY jump in cloud revenue in the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, its outstanding performance obligations also jumped 29% YOY and now stand at $80 billion. The management stated that about 43% of this will be recognized as revenue over the year. More recently, Oracle has been moving higher on reports of a $10 billion deal with Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI. The company is in talks to rent Oracle servers, but there is no confirmation yet. The stock was up 3% after the news.\n\nAs organizations continue to transition toward cloud, Oracle will see an increase in demand. The company is expanding its global footprint and is building 100 data centers. It has partnerships with some of the biggest tech companies including Nvidia which will boost the stock.\n\nOracle has an average price target of $136 from 24 analysts. It is a 12.84% upside from the current level. Out of the 24 analysts, 18 have a strong buy rating for the stock. Buy ORCL stock before it skyrockets.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt is still not too late to buy Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The company reported impressive financials with a 117% YOY net income growth and a 27% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nIts daily active users stood at 3.24 billion across all the platforms which is a 7% YOY growth. Driven by the rising advertising revenue, the company has found a strong footing in the industry.\n\nThe company is using generative AI tools to work with advertisers. This allows them to see higher ad views and conversions. Meta is working on building more advanced AI models to cater to the global audience.\n\nIt has $58.1 billion in cash which allows the company to keep investing in AI projects like building new data centres or hiring top talent. The revenue from its AI-powered products has also grown, and it is using AI aggressively to achieve user satisfaction. Meta is one of the best AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nExchanging hands for $481, META stock is up 39% YTD and 44% in the last six months. The stock has a strong buy rating with the highest price target of $593, a 26% upside from the current level. META has a lot of potential and innovation abilities to meet the changing needs of the audience. This is one stock that is set to keep roaring higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nvidia (NVDA) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.68 a share six days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 22, 2024.\n\nNVDA has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.9%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.68 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52.\n\nNVDA is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nMicrosoft is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 23, 2024. MSFT's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.90 a share 68 days from its next earnings release.\n\nMicrosoft's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.33% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVDA and MSFT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Meet the Only 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Over the Last 3 Months",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" companies caught the market by storm in 2023 for their market-crushing gains. But the group has showed signs of cooling off.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are the only three Magnificent Seven stocks that are outperforming the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) over the last three months.\n\nHere's why each of the three is doing well, whether these stocks are buys, and how to approach investing in the Magnificent Seven right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nLike any stock that has run up fast, Nvidia is one that investors have mixed feelings about. Some might think it is a bubble waiting to pop, while others believe it is on the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence (AI). But so far, the story has been led by fundamentals, which suggests that Nvidia could keep running higher.\n\nSustained rapid growth can justify even the most sky-high valuations. Especially if a company can double earnings in a single year. That's exactly what analysts are expecting from Nvidia, with consensus estimates on 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $24.87, and $31.54 for 2026.\n\nFor context, the company made $11.93 in fiscal 2024 EPS and reported its full-year fiscal 2024 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nThe jump from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 looks promising, but there is concern that growth could cool in fiscal 2026. Still, if Nvidia notches $31.30 in fiscal 2026 EPS, that would give the stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 29 based on the current price.\n\nThat's a compelling valuation for a high-growth market leader in the early innings of the AI evolution. But it's also based on figures we won't see for nearly two years.\n\nWe'll get a better idea of how Nvidia is progressing toward these targets when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on May 22. As long as the growth is there, the stock could continue being a market winner. But if the narrative changes, even due to temporary factors, the stock could take a major hit.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nIn late February, Alphabet was the only Magnificent Seven stock with a cheaper valuation than the S&P 500. But that didn't last long.\n\nIt has been one of the hottest tech stocks as of late and went from out of favor to making a new all-time high. NVDA Chart\n\nAlphabet achieved phenomenal results in its recent quarter and announced its first dividend in company history. But it's not like the results were relatively better than peers like Meta Platforms.\n\nRather, the stock was being held back due to AI-related blunders and a view that it didn't have the innovation of a peer like Meta Platforms that has done a masterful job of monetizing AI to improve product performance and its bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is still looking to bring something new to the AI table. The recent run-up has more to do with strength from its legacy businesses like Google Search, Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android and a reminder that Alphabet is a cash cow with a ton of dry powder to reinvest in the business, make acquisitions, buy back stock -- and now, pay a dividend.\n\nAlphabet had some catching up to do, and it looks to be fairly priced now. For the next leg higher, I think the company has to show more innovation, but there are some levers it can pull in the meantime to provide value to shareholders.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon was one of the hardest-hit stocks in 2022, sinking to multiyear lows. Shares were so cheap that there were arguments that Amazon Web Services (AWS) alone was worth at least as much as the whole market cap of the company, which fell below $1 trillion in 2022 and is hovering around $2 trillion today.\n\nBeing way oversold helped propel a monster comeback in 2023. But AWS didn't even have a good year in 2023. Now, AWS has turned around, and the rest of the business is doing well, too. Just about everything is going right at Amazon, including cloud computing and domestic and international e-commerce.\n\nThe issue is that the stock still isn't cheap, and probably won't be anytime soon. Consensus analyst estimates call for 2024 EPS of $4.54, and $5.76 for 2025 -- giving Amazon a huge 32.5 P/E ratio based on 2025 earnings.\n\nSome investors might prefer to value the company based on price-to-sales (P/S) instead of P/E since it spends so much money reinvesting in the business and books far lower earnings than it could if it were more conservative. For 2024, analyst consensus sales estimates are $638.2 billion, and $708.7 billion for 2025, which would give Amazon a P/S ratio of 2.75 based on 2025 figures. From that perspective, Amazon is more reasonably priced. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe glass-half-full outlook would say that it deserves a higher P/S today than in the past because each dollar of sales is of higher quality. To an extent, that's true because AWS is making up a larger share of the company's revenue, and AWS is a high-margin cash cow that drives the profitability of the broader business.\n\nFor context, AWS generated $9.4 billion in operating income in the first quarter of 2024 on $25 billion in sales, compared to $5.1 billion from $21.4 billion in sales a year earlier. AWS still only made up about 17.5% of total Amazon sales in the recent quarter. But it was a much smaller share of the business just five years ago, whereas today, it can help move the top line and dominate the bottom line.\n\nThere's certainly a buy case to be made for Amazon, even after its recent run-up. But it doesn't have Nvidia's growth, and yet it is still an expensive stock, even based on estimates over a year into the future.\n\nBuying a top stock for the right reasons\n\nIt's important to understand that sentiment and context can have just as much impact on a stock's short-term performance -- if not more -- than the fundamentals.\n\nAs a long-term investor, it can be helpful to know what is driving a stock's price to determine if it is a good value or if a lot of the expected growth is already priced in.\n\nThe story is out on Nvidia. The projections are so lofty that the company has to put up unbelievable results just to look like a good value. But so far, it has lived up to the hype.\n\nAlphabet is an excellent example of a company that made no significant changes but saw its stock price shoot up once investors were reminded that the strength of its core business outshines any AI snags.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon had sold off far too much for such a high-quality business. The growth is excellent, but the valuation is a lot higher today.\n\nThere's a variety of reasons the other four Magnificent Seven are underperforming over the last three months. But as a generalization, I'd say that Microsoft and Meta Platforms have raised the bar so high (and both stocks have crushed the Nasdaq Composite over the last year and a half) that it's hard to blow expectations out of the water.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple and Tesla are facing slowing growth, a bad look relative to their better-performing megacap peers.\n\nExpectations are everything to investors. If Apple and Tesla return to growth, it would be easier for those stocks to impress. But the degree of uncertainty with that prospect is why both stocks are out of favor.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia is a darling that is already expected to keep growing. And as we saw with Microsoft and Meta in their recent earnings, a company can keep growing at an impressive clip, but it still might not be enough to move the needle.\n\nThe simplest way to approach the Magnificent Seven is to go with the company or companies you think have the best chance of growing or blending growth and value over at least the next three to five years rather than jumping in and out of whatever is working in a matter of months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should NVIDIA (NVDA) be in Your Portfolio Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22.\n\nThe company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 20.2%.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues of $24 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $24.27 billion, which indicates a whopping 237% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has been revised upward by 3 cents to $5.52 per share over the past seven days. This suggests year-over-year growth of 406% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.09 per share.\n\nNVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 91.8% year-to-date surge in its stock price, pushing the company to the forefront of technology and innovation. NVIDIA also achieved a massive milestone in March 2024 by joining the exclusive club of companies with more than $2 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe surge reflects investors' confidence in NVIDIA's strategic positioning, robust financial performance and pivotal role in shaping transformative technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), gaming and data center solutions. With the company gearing up to report its first-quarter earnings, let’s evaluate why it is the right time to buy this semiconductor stock.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nGenAI Investments Aid NVIDIA’s Financials\n\nIn recent quarters, NVIDIA has consistently delivered impressive financial results, surpassing revenue and earnings expectations. In the last reported results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company’s top and bottom lines increased 265% and 486%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Its revenue growth has been fueled by robust demand for chips needed for generative AI model development.\n\nNVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\n\nThe growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA’s A100, H100 and B100 AI chips, which are used to build and run AI applications, are the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\n\nWe believe that the generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips, thereby boosting the company’s top and bottom lines.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVIDIA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($5.68 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($5.52 per share), is +2.90%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWith the ongoing digitization trend and the increasing adoption of AI technologies across various industries, NVIDIA is well-positioned to maintain its strong financial performance in the to-be-reported quarter as well as quarters ahead.\n\nNVIDIA remains a market darling, and razor-sharp investors should encash on its likely long-term upward movement. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next fiscal year is 86% and 16%, respectively. The long-term expected earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 30.9%, significantly higher than the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s 17.2%.\n\nNVIDIA is also a cash-rich company, making it immune to market upheavals. The company’s cash and cash equivalents were $25.98 billion as of Jan 28, 2024, up from $18.28 billion on Oct 29, 2023.\n\nNonetheless, NVIDIA trades at a one-year forward P/S of 21.20X, a massive premium to the Semiconductor-General industry’s forward P/S multiple of 14.11X. Therefore, many would argue that the stock is a risky bet. However, we beg to differ due to its consistent financial performance and strong growth opportunities in various untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing over the long term.\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA has a Growth Score of B at present. Per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with a combination of a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 and a Growth Score of A or B offer solid investment opportunities.\n\nTherefore, considering the company’s impressive growth profile and attractive Zacks Style Score, we believe it is the right time to invest in the stock.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Zscaler ZS, Salesforce CRM and Paycom Software PAYC, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zscaler’s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised 2 cents upward to $2.73 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 52.5%. The long-term estimated earnings growth rate for the stock stands at 28.1%. The ZS stock has plunged 17.8% YTD.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Salesforce’s fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 3 cents to $9.71 per share in the past 60 days, which calls for an increase of 18.1% on a year-over-year basis. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for the stock is pegged at 17.4%. CRM shares have risen 9.1% YTD.\n\nThe consensus mark for Paycom’s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 3 cents to $7.68 per share over the past 30 days, which indicates a marginal 0.9% decrease from 2023. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.4%. The PAYC stock has declined 14.2% in the YTD period.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Pharma Stocks Harnessing AI Brainpower for Big Breakthroughs",
        "content": "It’s no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform every industry and sector, pharma included. But how do those companies plan to leverage AI, and what will it do for their stocks? The answers, of course, are as varied as the companies leveraging AI.\n\nMany will leverage AI for the process of drug discovery. AI is much more efficient at identifying compounds with potential efficacy for a given disease or disorder. Others are utilizing AI to improve the development process for validation assays, the tests used to identify compounds. The use cases go on and on.\n\nThere’s also the question of how AI will affect individual pharma stocks. The answer there, too, will be varied. AI will serve to raise the prices of some stocks while others will not be so fortunate. Let’s take a look at seven pharma stocks to buy that leverage AI and what investors can expect.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSchrodinger (SDGR) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nSchrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR) continues to develop its physics-based computational platform, which heavily leverages artificial intelligence. That platform is especially useful for the purpose of drug discovery, making Schrodinger one of the more prominent AI pharma stocks.\n\nThe company leverages that platform for the internal purpose of identifying potentially valid pharmaceutical candidates. In other words, Schrodinger operates its own pharma discovery arm. Meanwhile, the company also licenses that platform as a software to other firms.\n\nInvestors who’ve placed their capital behind Schrodinger have gone on something of a roller coaster ride. During the most recent period, the company reported $36.6 million in revenues, $33.4 million of which came from software licensing activities. Software licensing segments improved by 3.7% during the quarter. The big decline in revenues was due to a large collaboration payment during the first quarter of 2023. Schrodinger anticipates making as much in drug discovery revenue in 2024 as it did during the first quarter of 2023.\n\nInvestors should expect its fundamentals to grow in the high single digits into the double digits. The company also has a pipeline of in-house therapeutics in development, which gives it the potential to explode in value moving forward. For those reasons, Schrodinger at least remains interesting and should be a reasonable consideration for investors.\n\nAbsci (ABSI) pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factory\n\nSource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbsci (NASDAQ:ABSI) is another firm proving that data is king across all industries in the era of artificial intelligence. The potential of ABSI stock lies in the application of generative AI to drug creation. That opportunity is really predicated on the strengths of AI in sifting through scads of data at speeds never before possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis stock itself is interesting because it represents a mix of positive catalysts and potential flags. The company has entered into a collaboration with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) for an AI-designed oncology target. That program could be worth up to $247 million in funding and milestone payments with additional royalties possible.\n\nYet, Absci continues to lose money and consistently produces a million dollars or less in revenues on a quarterly basis. The company also offered up more than 19 million shares of its stock in a public offering a few months ago. Those shares were priced at $4.50. Although such actions introduce the potential for dilution, share prices have consistently stayed above that offering price since.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), as a large pharma firm and stock, is leveraging AI in multiple ways.\n\nIn short, Bristol-Myers Squibb is working with multiple smaller teams outside of its firm while also developing in-house capabilities. The company is working withExscientia (NASDAQ:EXAI) to accelerate the discovery of small molecule candidates. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers Squibb is concurrently collaborating with Insitro to develop disease models on which to test potential therapeutics. Then, the company is also working with Owkin to enhance clinical trial success strategies. Each of those three companies extensively leverages AI in its respective operations.\n\nEarlier this year Bristol-Myers Squibb enlisted the help of VantAI in leveraging generative AI. The firms are working together to better understand the application of molecular glues to proteins. If the project is successful, VantAI stands to reap as much as $674 million in milestone payments. Molecular glues work to bind together two or more proteins that would not normally bind. Thus, Bristol-Myers Squibb may, in time, develop totally novel treatments for diseases and disorders.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock is on many investors’ radars due to the success of its weight loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nSales of those drugs continue to thrive despite supply chain issues that continue to plague the company. In short, Eli Lilly is well positioned to thrive currently on the success of its weight loss champions. The sky continues to be the limit, as the company chose to hike its sales forecast beyond Wall Street’s expectations even with nagging supply chain issues.\n\nWhile that’s arguably the top reason to consider investing in Eli Lilly, its AI efforts are very intriguing. Scientists at the company were particularly surprised at the ability of AI to produce potentially viable and novel therapeutics humans could not have envisioned. That was the opinion of Chief Information and Digital Officer Diogo Rau. He noted that much of the application of AI in drug discovery centers around iteratively teaching the AI how to correctly produce viable candidates.\n\nRau noted that while the structures of many of the molecules AI is producing at the firm were “weird”, they are also viable. That leads Rau to believe AI is set to revolutionize the types of therapeutics beyond that which humans could have envisioned in the past.\n\nNovartis (NVS) nvs stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNovartis (NYSE:NVS) is an interesting pharma stock to consider if for no other reason than it exemplifies the applicability of AI across all fields.\n\nThat truth is exemplified in the career path of the firm’s current head of AI and computational sciences, Dr. Bulent Kiziltan. He started out studying black holes and ultimately found his way to Novartis. If nothing else, his decision to join Novartis is a clear indication of the potential of AI in the pharmaceutical realm.\n\nFurthermore, Novartis currently has more than 150 ongoing AI projects. The company has partnered with leading AI firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), to scale AI firm-wide.\n\nThe results from those projects will take time to materialize, and the current status of the company is strong. Novartis recently released earnings results showing 11% top-line growth and operating income that increased by 22%.\n\nThe stock represents a potent mix of strong fundamentals and strong AI-driven upside worth considering for investors.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is an interesting stock at the moment for a number of reasons. Most of those reasons can be traced back to its pandemic success and the current hangover therefrom.\n\nThe company’s pandemic success is also attributable to AI.\n\nInvestors are well aware that Pfizer’s shares have fallen dramatically of late. The pandemic is over, and Paxlovid sales have essentially cratered. Shares continue to trade below $30. The company is no longer capable of reaching $100 billion in annual sales. However, many investors, myself included, see great potential in the firm at this price. It certainly represents a nice income opportunity through its current high-yield dividend.\n\nDid you know that Paxlovid was developed using AI? Pfizer leveraged IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) supercomputing might to successfully develop the drug. Pfizer noted that in doing so, it was able to reduce development timelines considerably. Who knows, perhaps Pfizer will successfully develop the next blockbuster drug by utilizing AI again.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the other weight loss stock dominating the pharma sector currently. It’s also a company dedicating substantial resources to AI.\n\nIn March, the Novo Nordisk Foundation announced that one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers will be built in Denmark, the company’s home base. The project is a collaboration between multiple funding organizations in the European nation and Nvidia.\n\nThe collaboration will establish a national center housing one of Nvidia’s supercomputers. It will be accessible to both public and private researchers within Denmark. The project is intended to accelerate solutions to societal problems.\n\nCEO of the foundation Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen noted, “Drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment, as well as complicated life science challenges, are examples of areas where extreme AI computing power can enable the positive transformation of our society.”\n\nNovo Nordisk will continue to be a firm to watch for its early success in commercializing weight loss drugs. That success is leading to investment that it may use to jump ahead further in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Quality Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Before June",
        "content": "Growth stock investors should be considering quantum computing stocks to buy this month, as they represent some of the most dynamic opportunities in the technology sector.\n\nQuantum computing is a massive shift in computing that offers the potential to solve complex problems at speeds and scales that were previously unimaginable.\n\nIn short, quantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in different ways than classical computers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile classical computers rely on bits to store and process information in binary form of 0 or 1, quantum computers operate at subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons. Quantum bits allow these particles to exist in more than one state simultaneously, greatly increasing processing speeds.\n\nAnd quantum computing is just going to get bigger. A Zapata survey shows that more than two-thirds of companies with revenues of $250 million and computing budgets of at least $1 million are spending more than $1 million yearly to develop quantum computing applications.\n\nQuantum computing can revolutionize industries such as pharmaceuticals, finance, and logistics. And finding quantum computing stocks to buy provides the opportunity to capitalize on this disruptive technology.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader analyzes stocks based on earnings performance, revenue growth, momentum and analyst sentiment. Based on those findings, these are the best quantum computing stocks to buy today.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most dynamic semiconductor stocks you can buy. The company’s powerful graphics processing units are in high demand for their ability to operate machine learning and generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThat’s help push NVDA stock to incredible highs, as the company reached a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion with massive growth in the last year.\n\nIts Cuda Quantum platform is a first-of-its-kind open-source platform that allows developers to integrate and program quantum processing units, GPUs, and central processing units (CPUs) into a single system.\n\nNvidia is reporting earnings next week for its fiscal first quarter of 2025, and expectations are high for another blowout quarter. NVDA stock is up 84% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a Nvidia competitor that is making inroads in the GPU field with its MI300 semiconductors that are projected to bring in $4 billion this year from the MI300. It also has a 90% market share for AI chips for personal computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD has a partnership with the quantum computing company Riverlane that uses AMD’s Zinq UltraScale+ RFSoC as a platform to interface between Riverlane’s control software and the high-speed pulse lasers that are fired to control qubits, which are used in quantum computing.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter were somewhat of a disappointment, however. Revenue of $5.4 billion was up only 2% from a year ago. Profits of $2.5 billion were up 9%, and the company posted a net profit of $123 million after losing $139 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAMD stock will surely be a player in the quantum computing space. The stock is up 4% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NASDAQ:TSM) isn’t a competitor to Nvidia or AMD because it’s a much different kind of company. But it’s a brilliant way to invest in the future of quantum computing.\n\nRather than being a designer of semiconductors, TSMC is a manufacturer. Nvidia, AMD and other semiconductor companies outsource the mass production of their semiconductors to Taiwan Semiconductor, which has roughly a 90% market share in making the most expensive and advanced semiconductors on the market.\n\nThat puts TSMC in the prime position to profit from the build out of quantum computing.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter was for $18.87 billion in revenue, up 12.9% from a year ago. Management expects performance to improve for the remainder of the year due to high-demand 3-nanometer and 5-nm products.\n\nTSM stock is up 53% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) mu stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a semiconductor manufacturing company that makes products for memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND and NOR technology.\n\nIts CP2K platform is an open-source quantum chemistry tool that can be used for a variety of applications, including simulations of solid-state biological systems.\n\nIn a test with AMD processors and Micron DDR5 data center memory, Micron says it achieved a 2.1x increase in speed with AMD’s fourth-generation EPYC processors\n\nRevenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, up from $3.69 billion a year ago. The company posted net income of $793 million and 71 cents per share, a year after losing $2.3 billion and $2.12 per share.\n\nMU stock is up 80% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another semiconductor company. Its products are used for data centers, networking, storage, software, wireless and industrial products.\n\nIt has a multiyear partnership with the California Institute of Technology to conduct quantum science research through the Broadcom Quantum Laboratory at Caltech.\n\nThe effort supports collaboration in quantum computing, sensing, measurement and engineering, and is expected to open in 2025.\n\nBroadcom also expects to see good things from its acquisition of VMWare, which will allow it to utilize VMware’s hybrid cloud platform. The platform provides large corporate customers with the power of a cloud network with on-premises data centers, and uses Nvidia GPUs to allow its customers to run AI models on-site.\n\nCombined, Broadcom’s reach makes it an attractive choice when seeking quantum computing stocks to buy.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Here's My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Instead",
        "content": "There is no doubt that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy on the market in the past year-and-a-half thanks to the critical role it is playing in the advancement of this technology.\n\nAfter all, training large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without chips from Nvidia. Major cloud computing companies and governments around the globe have been lining up to buy Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs), leading to outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThere is a good chance that Nvidia will be able to sustain the impressive growth that it is posting in its top and bottom lines. That's because the company's dominant position in the AI chip market seems safe considering the technology lead that it enjoys over its rivals. However, there is a chance that investors who aren't comfortable paying for Nvidia's expensive valuation could be seeking alternatives to capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nNvidia is trading at 75 times trailing earnings. It may be able to justify that valuation by sustaining its red-hot growth, but for investors looking for a cheaper AI stock, The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) could turn out to be a top pick that could be an even better buy than Nvidia. Let's look at the reasons why.\n\nThe Trade Desk is using AI to win market share in a lucrative niche\n\nThe Trade Desk provides a cloud-based, data-driven, programmatic advertising platform to advertisers. This platform allows them to purchase ad inventory from multiple channels, set up, run, and optimize ad campaigns, and serve ads to the right audience on the relevant platform in a cost-efficient manner to increase advertisers' return on investment.\n\nThe company uses real-time insights and algorithms to ensure that advertisers using its platform can get the most out of their ad dollars. More importantly, The Trade Desk has been leveraging AI to ensure that advertisers get more out of its platform. In 2018, the company launched and started integrating an AI tool known as Koa into its platform. Koa analyzed almost 9 million queries each second \"to help buyers extend audience reach and spend more efficiently.\"\n\nMore specifically, The Trade Desk claimed that Koa can help advertisers increase their reach by 3 times and reduce costs by 20%. The company released a new AI tool called Kokai last year, utilizing 13 million advertising impressions each second to \"help advertisers buy the right ad impressions, at the right price, to reach the target audience at the best time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch AI-enabled tools are helping The Trade Desk grow at a faster pace than the digital advertising market, and accelerate its growth. For instance, in 2023, the company's revenue increased 23% to $1.95 billion. That was well ahead of the 10.7% growth in digital ad spending last year. More importantly, The Trade Desk's latest results for the first quarter of 2024 suggest that it is winning a bigger share of the digital ad market as its growth is accelerating.\n\nThe company reported a 28% year-over-year jump in revenue last quarter to $491 million, a nice increase from the 21% year-over-year growth it clocked in the same period last year. The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin also increased by five percentage points from the year-ago period.\n\nThe Trade Desk's earnings of $0.26 per share beat the consensus estimate of $0.22 per share. Its revenue was also higher than the expectation of $480 million. Even better, The Trade Desk's revenue guidance of $575 million is higher than the Wall Street forecast of $567 million. The EBITDA forecast of $223 million has also exceeded the $219 million consensus expectation.\n\nThe company's quarterly revenue forecast would translate into a jump of 23% from the year-ago quarter, while its adjusted EBITDA is on track to increase by a similar figure. It is also worth noting that digital ad spending is estimated to increase by 13.2% in 2024, and the Trade Desk's Q1 growth and Q2 guidance suggest that it is set to grow at a faster pace than the market once again.\n\nSo, The Trade Desk's strategy of using AI to power its programmatic ad platform is set to help it capture a bigger share of the digital ad market. This should bode well for the company's long-term growth. That's because the digital ad market is forecast to generate $1.15 trillion in annual revenue in 2030, up from $420 billion last year, as per Grand View Research.\n\nThe Trade Desk, therefore, has a massive addressable opportunity ahead of it, and the fact that it is gaining ground in the digital ad market explains why analysts have been increasing their growth expectations for the company. TTD Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nTTD Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nInvestors can expect the stock to deliver healthy gains\n\nThe Trade Desk stock is currently trading at 21 times sales, a small discount to its five-year average sales multiple of almost 24. Of course, the sales multiple is higher than the U.S. tech sector's price-to-sales ratio of 7, but The Trade Desk's growing stature in the digital ad market could justify it.\n\nIf the Trade Desk can maintain its current sales multiple after three years and achieves $3.52 billion in revenue in 2026, as per the chart in the previous paragraph, its market cap could increase to $74 billion. That points toward a jump of 72% from the current level.\n\nAlso, The Trade Desk is cheaper than Nvidia, which commands a sales multiple of 36. So, investors looking for a relatively cheaper alternative to Nvidia can consider buying The Trade Desk, as it could turn out to be a top AI stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in The Trade Desk right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and The Trade Desk wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 Cheap Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The rest of 2024 could be a breakout period for cheap Russell 2000 stocks. Thus far, the index posted a 3.6% gain since January, though it lags the S&P 500’s 10% bump. However, incoming tides might favor small-caps, setting the stage for a record run among cheap Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nInvestors are increasingly wary that investing in a large-cap index like the S&P 500 overexposes them to a few high-performing stocks that skew total returns. This concern is valid, as the “Magnificent 7” stocks make up nearly 30% of the overall index and, until recently, accounted for most of its gains compared to the relatively flat performance of the other 493 stocks. While the rest of the index catches up, investors still face company and sector-specific risks by holding concentrated tech positions in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and the other top S&P 500 stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, potential rate cuts or at least a prolonged pause could benefit small-caps needing growth capital. High debt costs have hindered small-cap borrowing, and investor cash not allocated to mega-caps has largely remained in money market funds. Although investors are gradually returning to stocks, nearly $6 trillion still sits in these funds. This dynamic created a vicious cycle for small-caps, struggling to attract investor interest compared to an attractive 5% (or more) fixed-income yield through money market accounts, high-yield savings, and bond ETFs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, this situation is changing, and these seven cheap Russell 2000 stocks stand to benefit the most.\n\nValley National Bancorp (VLY) A pink piggy bank sitting on three stacked textbooks with a green chalkboard in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs Fed rate cuts slowly take effect, banking stocks will move in one of two directions. Companies with limited debt or sufficient size to manage it, such as legacy mega-banks, will likely see their shares decline as net interest income dries up. Conversely, smaller regional banks with higher relative leverage and local real estate lending operations will benefit from lower borrowing rates and increasing consumer loan interest. Among these regional banks, Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) stands out as a particularly cheap Russell 2000 stock.\n\nValley National’s stock trades at a low 0.6x book value and 8x earnings, making it undervalued and inarguably cheap. Its strong balance sheet and low debt load, reflected in a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56 compared to the industry average of 1.2, demonstrate the bank’s lower leverage relative to competitors. The bank’s recent stock buyback initiative and a 5.7% trailing dividend yield further underscore its financial health.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts widely agree that Valley National is undervalued. Consensus estimates assign an average price target of $9.44, about 20% above its current share price. In addition to this bullish outlook, sentiment around the bank’s stock is improving, with around half of analysts now recommending a “hold,” a significant increase from the 50% who advised selling in the previous evaluation period.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Duolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a hidden gem in the education tech sector. Despite its shares more than doubling last year, it’s dipped 16% since January and 27% in the past week. However, given its strengths, the current dip presents a buying opportunity. Initially, there were doubts about the commercial viability of its mobile language learning apps. Still, Duolingo is proving its viability as an EdTech stock and a (relatively) cheap Russell 2000 stock contender.\n\nThe key to its success lies in its popularity among customers. Several factors contribute to its widespread appeal, including the increasing reliance on smartphones, the effectiveness of self-directed learning, engaging gamification elements, and lingering post-pandemic habits.\n\nDuolingo’s latest earnings report showed a 5447 year-over-year surge in subscription rates, generating $161 million for the quarter. The number of paid subscribers rose to 7.4 million, marking a 54% year-over-year increase. Building on this success, Duolingo recently announced plans to expand its educational offerings to include music and math lessons.\n\nAlthough some argue that Duolingo’s market valuation is too high, similar criticisms were once directed at Nvidia. With virtually no rivals matching its position, Duolingo is well-positioned to maintain its dominance into 2024 — this cheap Russell 2000 stock won’t remain so for long.\n\nUFP Industries (UFPI) Wooden planks stacked in a warehouse\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a lumber supply company that supports housing manufacturers. This cheap Russell 2000 stock stands to benefit from real estate trends rapidly changing as markets reach a “new normal” paradigm of higher-for-longer.\n\nAfter a significant slump throughout 2022 and most of 2023, new housing starts are stabilizing. This continued expansion indicates renewed enthusiasm for new builds in a still-hot real estate market. Although existing home prices stagnated and fell, developers seized the opportunity to attract middle-market homebuyers by offering new homes priced below market estimates and providing attractive financing deals to counter high mortgage rates.\n\nThis strategic move boosts UFP’s lumber supply operation. Additionally, the company’s solid fundamentals distinguish it from competitors. With a price-to-sales ratio of 1, investor enthusiasm is well-aligned with practical revenue targets. UFP’s cash flow is strong, with $788 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months. The company is also virtually debt-free, maintaining a healthy cash and net asset balance. These robust fundamentals position UFP to capitalize on evolving trends while providing a cushion against economic downturns or industry supply chain shocks, even as rate cut prospects remain uncertain.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Fabrinet (FN) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nThough often overlooked, Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) is becoming a key player among cheap Russell 2000 stocks, riding the artificial intelligence wave but sufficiently differentiated to avoid major competitive action. As a major upstream supplier for leading firms like Nvidia, it provides essential components for modern technology. Fabrinet’s product range is broad, but its fiber optic cable segment is the cheap Russell 2000 stock’s shining star.\n\nThe company produces cutting-edge, ultra-high-speed fiber optic cables that enable rapid communication between computers and hardware systems at speeds exceeding 800 GB per second. These cables facilitate swift, large-scale data transfers for AI-focused firms like Nvidia but also serve cloud computing and generalized data storage and management purposes. This segment of Fabrinet’s business currently generates about $500 million in revenue, with projections indicating a potential doubling of operational income in the coming years.\n\nShares surged recently, hitting a 22% gain since January and 150% over the past year. That momentum seems to be continuing, making it one of the best Russell 2000 stocks poised to capture steady-state AI sector growth.\n\nLattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a prominent semiconductor company focusing on various “big data” computing solutions, including edge and cloud computing. Its core products also span across consumer electronics like televisions and laptops, ensuring its market penetration and staying power. Recent financials indicate strength for this often-overlooked semiconductor company and cheap Russell 2000 stock.\n\nIn April’s earnings report, Lattice boosted its financial standing slightly, which “Came in as expected [reflecting] the near-term impact of cyclic industry headwinds,” according to CEO Jim Anderson. Revenue dropped by 20% year-over-year, and the company adapted to cost-cutting initiatives while roughly maintaining its gross margin. Net income dropped, too, though the company still posted an 11-cent EPS. Despite the ambivalent news, shares dipped by about 4%, which seems reasonable considering the headwinds Anderson referenced.\n\nOne reason is a slight slowdown in demand. Enthusiasm for general-purpose artificial intelligence seems to have peaked, and consumers are cutting spending. This indicates that firms with an AI advantage have enough computing power to sustain them for the foreseeable future.\n\nSimultaneously, slowing consumer sentiment means Lattice’s peripheral products, like televisions, are not selling as expected. However, apparent shifts in consumer sentiment could reverse this trend. Lattice’s strong financial position allows it to withstand periods of flat sales growth, while its expansive portfolio ensures longevity in a competitive industry.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUnlike many of today’s cheat Russell 2000 stocks, Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) thrives in any interest rate environment. Furthermore, the company’s management is at the forefront of emerging healthcare trends, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking flexibility and responsiveness alongside the wider real estate sector’s upside potential.\n\nIn response to senior living facilities’ challenges during the pandemic, management decisively sold most of its senior housing assets for about $4 billion in 2020 and 2021. The company then strategically reinvested the proceeds into life science and medical office portfolios, sectors with high-quality assets in leading markets and top-tier tenants, both marking today’s top emerging healthcare segments.\n\nHealthpeak’s strategic repositioning allows it to capitalize on potential regulatory changes in healthcare, especially cost-management initiatives targeting aging populations on fixed incomes. With its high-quality facilities in niche markets, Healthpeak is well-positioned to meet the rising demand from premier healthcare systems, anticipating that those who can afford it will demand a more concierge experience.\n\nFirstCash Holdings (FCFS) An image of a laptop with money flying out of the screen\n\nFirstCash Holdings (NASDAQ:FCFS) thrives in a shrinking economy by offering pawn services nationally and globally. To that end, the company’s stock posted a decent 9% gain year-to-date, widely in line with wider markets. Anticipate another increase as we enter the summer season and consumers sell unwanted spring cleaning items for quick cash. FirstCash stands out among typical pawn shops by also providing a range of fintech-style financing and payment options, positioning itself as a pioneer in a world increasingly moving away from cash transactions.\n\nDespite high investment outflows, FirstCash consistently generates substantial free cash flow, totaling $355 million over the past 12 months. Its growth trajectory is stable, averaging 25% annual revenue growth and 27% annual net income expansion over the past three years. Between 2021 and 2022, net income more than doubled, and that momentum hasn’t yet abated. While initial gains could be partly due to reduced pawn interactions during the pandemic, economic tightening likely contributed to the increase. If this trend continues, the cheap Russell 2000 stock is set for similar gains as we enter 2024’s second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Even amidst macroeconomic headwinds, the S&P 500 index has remained resilient. For the year-to-date, the index has trended higher by 10%. While it’s good to remain optimistic, preparing for the worst is equally important. I don’t intend to be a fearmonger and it’s unlikely that there will be a big crash. However, even a 10% to 15% correction in the index is significant. To remain prepared for any such scenario, this column intends to discuss some low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy and hold.\n\nIt’s first important to understand the reason for remaining cautious. GDP growth decelerated in Q1 2024, and this calls for rate cuts. However, with stubborn inflation, the Fed will likely be slow in pursuing expansionary policies. Fear of a hard landing will likely be the catalyst for a market correction.\n\nThe first-rate cut is likely before the Presidential elections. Therefore, any weakness in the market would be an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. For now, let’s discuss three low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn my view, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stock is a low-risk bet for two reasons. First, PCRFY stock has already been oversold and has mainly remained sideways in the last 12 months. Considering a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.5, I don’t see a downside from current levels for this 1.26% dividend yield stock.\n\nFurther, Panasonic Holdings is among the major players in the EV battery market. The company is high on innovation and has ambitious expansion plans through 2031. Once industry sentiments change, PCRFY stock is likely to deliver multibagger returns.\n\nIn terms of expansion plans, Panasonic is targeting to boost its EV battery manufacturing capacity to 200GWh by 2031. This will translate into steady revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nOn the innovation front, Panasonic has partnered with Sila Nanotechnologies to “purchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.” By 2031, Panasonic aims to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density. With all these positives, it’s a good time to buy PCRFY stock.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last few quarters have been mixed for technology stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has surged 215% in the previous 12 months. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has remained sideways during the same period. In my view, investors can consider some allocation to innovation driven ideas that have remained subdued. Apple is possibly among the best names to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn important point to note is that the application of AI is being talked about across sectors. AI is expected to contribute $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. I believe the markets are waiting for Apple’s big AI push. Once that’s clear, AAPL stock is likely to surge higher.\n\nApple ended Q2 2024 with $161 billion in cash and equivalents. This provides ample flexibility to invest in next-generation technology for its devices. Apple has already been making small acquisitions in the AI space. In another recent news, Apple is planning to sell its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset outside the United States. The wearable and services segment has ample scope for growth in the coming years.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong blue-chip commodity stocks, Vale (NYSE:VALE) is worth buying at current levels of $12.5. VALE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.2, indicatinghe extent of undervaluation. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 8.8%.\n\nRegarding potential returns, analysts have a median price target of $16 for the stock. This would imply an upside of 28% from current levels. Therefore, the total return from VALE stock is likely at 35% to 40% in the next 12 months, with valuations indicating limited downside risk.\n\nVale will benefit from relatively higher iron ore prices from a business perspective. A possible rate cut towards the end of the year can trigger a rally for industrial commodities. This will support revenue and adjust EBITDA upside.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for Q1 2024, Vale reported the highest quarterly iron ore production since 2019. Copper and nickel production also witnessed healthy growth. If this trend is sustained, the company will be positioned to deliver strong free cash flows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Long-Term Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "Certain companies and their stocks are well-regarded on Wall Street. Strong management teams, solid execution and growing profits and sales often lead to a stock being given the highest rating among analysts. This is typically a strong buy rating or its equivalent. It is reserved for best-in-class stocks that are outpacing their peers and that have reliable future growth prospects. These companies are typically considered good long-term stocks to buy.\n\nWhile analyst ratings are not foolproof, they provide investors with a sense of how a stock is being viewed by professionals on Wall Street. The ratings can be a good indicator of whether sentiment towards a stock is bullish (positive) or bearish (negative). Price targets can be helpful too as they indicate whether analysts see more growth ahead for a stock or a likely pullback in the share price.\n\nAnalyst ratings should form one part of the research investors do on a stock. For investors looking for long-term stocks to buy, these three companies are strong options.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow looks like a great time to buy shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The stock has a strong buy rating and median price target that is 8% higher than current levels. NVDA stock is currently drifting sideways before the company reports earnings on May 22. Analysts are pounding the table on the stock ahead of the upcoming print, which is likely to send the share price higher.\n\nAnalysts at Wells Fargo, for example, just raised their price target on NVDA stock to $1,150 a share from $970 previously. That new price target is 21% higher than where the company’s share price is currently sitting. Wells Fargo is urging investors to buy the stock before earnings, which have traditionally been a catalyst for Nvidia. While trading has been subdued lately, Nvidia’s share price is still up 96% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to continue benefitting from growing use of its microchips in artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) Delta (DAL) airlines plane mid take-off\n\nSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com\n\nDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) has earned a strong buy rating from 17 analysts following the carrier’s record first-quarter sales. The median price target on DAL stock is $59.74, which is 12% higher than the current share price. Delta is one of the few major U.S. carriers to have a strong buy rating. Analysts clearly like that Delta swung to a profit and announced record sales for Q1 of this year. The airline is benefitting from a surge in global travel demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nDelta announced Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents versus 36 cents that was expected among analysts who track the company. Revenue totaled $12.56 billion, slightly below Wall Street forecasts of $12.59 billion but a record for the first quarter of any year. Management at the carrier said they are seeing strong bookings for both leisure and business travel as Americans take to the skies again.\n\nDelta forecast Q2 earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share, which is ahead of analysts’ forecast of $2.23 a share. DAL stock is up 31% this year but remains below pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

The consensus price target on MSFT stock among 33 analysts is $489.89 per share, which implies nearly 16% upside. Like Nvidia, shares of Microsoft have drifted lately. Over the past month, the company’s stock is only up 2%. YTD, the share price has increased 14%, matching the performance of the Nasdaq index on which it trades.\n\nThere are still plenty of reasons to be bullish on Microsoft stock. The company remains a leader in AI due to its close relationship with privately held OpenAI. And Microsoft’s financial results remain extremely strong, fueled largely by growth in cloud computing. The company is reportedly planning to introduce new AI tools for use with its Windows operating system and its cloud-computing infrastructure at its Build conference next week.\n\nOver five years, MSFT stock has risen 230%, making it one of the great long-term stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "content": "With the market performing relatively well and many companies posting first-quarter earnings, investors are getting a clearer picture of stocks destined to take off this year. By picking the hottest stocks to buy now, investors can realize serious returns as the surging momentum continues.\n\nThese three stocks are the hottest picks for this May and offer some of the best growth potential through recent short-term advancements and long-term stability. You can be confident that you are making a safe and intelligent buy this month.\n\nLet’s learn more about the reasons behind these stocks’ recent performances. They are stirring up excitement and getting the ball rolling for a hot year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is one of the most exciting fintech companies of recent years. Formerly known as Square, Block has some of the most popular payment processing technology and operates the payment-sharing platform CashApp. While Block is under federal investigation for compliance issues, many expect the company to prevail.\n\nBlock established its goal of higher profit margins and “the rule of 40, ” confirming its position as a profitable company by 2026. To ensure this, Block laid off employees in January until profits rise.\n\nSo far this year, Block is off to a great start. Q1 saw a record quarterly net income of $472 million and gross profit of $2.09 billion. That represents a 22% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Cash App’s gross profit grew by 25% YOY and Square’s by 19%.\n\nClearly, Block is hot, coming from such a promising first quarter. And, it has exciting plans to sustain this momentum. One of Block’s most promising future projects is its continued investments in Bitcoin. Block has incorporated ways for users to buy and convert cash into Bitcoin and saw a gross profit of $80 million from Bitcoin in Q1.\n\nWith the company’s promising performance and continued dedication to improving its profitability and worthiness as a stock, investors should buy and hold with confidence as Block continues to rise in prominence.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the largest beverage companies, and many think of it as the only true rival to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). However, Pepsi has a substantial edge over Coca-Cola because its products and market reach are much more diversified. Pepsi not only has extremely popular beverages but also has a solid foothold in food.\n\nPepsi’s two leading food sellers, Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods, are at the head of its food business. These two companies made up over half of Pepsi’s sales over the last year leading into this quarter. Despite a recall that damaged sales of Quaker products, Pepsi managed a 2.3% net revenue increase and a 6% increase in EPS under GAAP in Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, this isn’t the first time Pepsi has proven its resilience and ability to overcome challenges while performing exceptionally. PEP maintained a healthy operating margin and has been a consistently growing stock for many years. It thrives with celebrity-endorsed campaigns and innovative product placement at unique events.\n\nTherefore, investors can get PEP while it’s hot and then rest easy as it generates consistent profits for years to come.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest companies and best-performing stocks ever, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rarely a bad time to buy. However, this month is another time that investors should consider buying the e-commerce giant.\n\nWith the heavy competition surrounding AI and cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) reigns as the top player, owning over 30% of the market. After collaborating on the proclaimed “super chip” GB2000 with tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AWS has announced an exciting partnership extension between these two behemoths to advance generative AI innovation.\n\nA deal will likely extend and widen AWS’s lead over major competitors like Microsoft and Google. In addition, Amazon continues to make massive investments in AI players like Anthropic, the largest competitor to generative AI giant ChatGPT.\r\nAnd, AMZN continues to dominate on the e-commerce side as well. Net sales increased 13% YOY in the first quarter, and net income increased to $10.4 billion. Operating cash flow jumped by 82% over the trailing twelve months, and Amazon has shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "JD.com, Inc. JD is slated to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 16.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $35.75 billion, indicating growth of 1.05% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pinned at 63 cents per share, suggesting an 8.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.\r\n\r\nJD.com surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 9.7% on average.\n\nJD.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise JD.com, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nJD.com, Inc. price-eps-surprise | JD.com, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe company’s JD Retail segment, comprising the e-commerce business, is expected to have been the key catalyst in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum with the JD Procurement and Sales Manager Livestreaming initiative is likely to have contributed well to the segment’s performance in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, the increasing number of flagship stores on JD’s platform, along with strengthening relationships with high-end brands, is likely to have benefited the segment.\r\n\r\nJD’s strong efforts in offering services at the best prices on the back of its scale and lower procurement costs from suppliers are expected to have benefited its first-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening of JD.com’s omnichannel offerings is also expected to get reflected in JD Retail’s revenue performance.\r\n\r\nApart from retail efforts, the impacts of the rising momentum of JD Health on the heels of 24/7 free online medical consultation and online pharmacy retail services are expected to get reflected in the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s results. Growing momentum across JD’s online medical center is likely to have been a positive.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum across JD Logistics on the back of the growing network of domestic and overseas warehouses, and transportation is expected to have contributed well.\r\n\r\nThe company’s expanding quick delivery services in the lower-tier cities are likely to have aided it in gaining traction in these cities in the first quarter. Further, the strengthening logistics network in the international regions is anticipated to have contributed to the quarter’s performance.\r\n\r\nHowever, its mounting fulfillment expenses, including procurement, warehousing, delivery, customer service and payment processing expenses, are likely to have weighed on its first-quarter performance.\r\n\r\nChallenging macroeconomic conditions in China are likely to have been concerning for JD.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for JD.com this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here, as you see below.\r\n\r\nJD.com has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

        "title": "The Next AI Bull Run Just Started: 3 Top Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend",
        "content": "Yes, I know the last year has been all AI every day, but this theme is still early days. Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology.\n\nJust this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s MSFT OpenAI, and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nAdditionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally.\n\nNew AI Product Releases\n\nOpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework.\n\nThe GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online.\n\nThen, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT.\n\nIn one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant.\n\nThe presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow.\n\nAgain, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.\n\nStock Picks\n\nFor this next bull run in AI stocks, my favorite player is Alphabet GOOGL. Many analysts and commentators have been very loud about how Google is playing catch up in AI, or that GPTs are going to disrupt Google's search engine.\n\nThey have forgotten just how deeply entrenched Alphabet’s products are in daily life. Alphabet has nine products with more than 1 billion users along with the epic amounts of data and engineers to implement the new technology.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet enjoys both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and a compelling technical trading setup.\n\nGOOGL stock just broke out from a bull flag and looks ready to make new YTD highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet also has also has a very reasonable valuation, trading at 22.5x forward earnings, which is in line with the market average and below its 10-year median of 26.2x. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMy next AI stock recommendation is not very original. Nvidia NVDA, has been and is the name to own for the trend in AI. The company is simply years ahead of other semiconductor producers, and its data center chips remain the key piece of infrastructure for technology being built with generative AI.\n\nNvidia also jumped back onto the Zacks Rank this morning with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates, with FY25 increasing by 7% in the last two months.\n\nAnd even with all the talk of Nvidia being wildly overpriced, the stock remains reasonably valued thanks to the massive growth of sales and earnings. Today, Nvidia is trading at 40x forward earnings, just below the industry average and its 10-year median.\n\nEPS are also forecast to grow at an incredible 30% annually over the next 3-5 years.\n\nNVDA stock, like GOOGL, also just broke out from a clean bull flag. As the leading name in AI, I would expect Nvidia to run to new highs in no time. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMy final AI stock pick for the next leg higher is Arista Networks ANET. Lesser known than the other two tech giants shared, Arista Networks is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions for large data centers. The company specializes in designing and delivering high-performance network switches and software-defined networking (SDN) solutions that offer scalability, reliability, and programmability.\n\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in providing the networking infrastructure necessary to support AI workloads and applications. As AI models become increasingly complex and data-intensive, they require robust and high-speed network connections to transfer data between servers, storage systems, and other components of the AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence boom has been and will continue to be a major boon to Arista’s core business.\n\nLike the others, ANET also has a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions.\n\nArista Networks stock has actually shown relative strength during the recent selloff, and over the last two and a half months it has gained more than both Nvidia and Alphabet. Because I am a fan of momentum, I consider this relative strength to be very bullish, especially in this AI context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nDon’t sleep on the AI boom, because we are still early days. Keen investors will continue to be given opportunities to profit from this new technology, so keep your ears to the ground, focus on stocks with top Zacks Ranks, and be a prudent risk manager.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 22, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +406.4%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $24.27 billion, up 237.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.93% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?\n\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.90%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $4.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.16, delivering a surprise of +13.41%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nNvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nMay 15 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley firm Cerebras Systems on Wednesday said it will supply a supercomputing system to Aleph Alpha, a German technology startup that will use it to develop artificial intelligence for the German Armed Forces.\n\nCerebras has created a computing system that aims to rival Nvidia for training AI systems with huge amounts of data. The company has previously won a deal to supply G42, the government-backed firm in the United Arab Emirates, with AI supercomputers, though those machines will be physically located in the United States.\n\nBy contrast, the deal with Aleph Alpha, a leading AI firm viewed as among Europe's rivals to U.S. firms such as OpenAI, will involve shipping Cerebras supercomputers to a secure data center in Germany, the first time that a Cerebras system has been installed in Europe.\n\n\"The German Armed Forces is a top-tier customer, and Aleph Alpha is one of the AI leaders,\" Cerebras Chief Executive Andrew Feldman told Reuters. \"The competition was fierce.\"\n\nThe two companies did not give a value for the deal but described it as a multi-year agreement in which Cerebras would help Aleph Alpha train generative AI models for the German Armed Forces.\n\n\"Like most companies, armed forces are looking for world class AI,\" Feldman said. \"They're looking to train models (for) language, vision (and) multi-data type models.\" (Reporting by Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Sam Holmes)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 Top Stocks to Tap Nasdaq's New All-Time High",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a robust 2023 and first quarter of 2024. The bull run has also continued into the second quarter despite growing concerns over inflation.\n\nOn May 14, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended 0.8% higher to close at a new record high of 16,511.18 points. The index has rallied 10% year to date after jumping 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2020.\n\nThis year, so far, has been great for Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&P 500 also notching record highs in February. The Nasdaq was a shade slow in catching up but finally hit an all-time high in February.\n\nThe index has since had a solid run and May particularly has been great. The rally comes despite growing concerns over inflation and rising uncertainty over rate cuts.\n\nFactors Driving the Nasdaq Rally\n\nThis year, the Nasdaq’s dream run has primarily been driven by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI.\n\nWhile the opinions of experts on the prospects of generative AI vary, significant enthusiasm surrounding the field has been noticed over the past year. Many believe that AI is still at a nascent stage and its full potential is yet to be realized.\n\nOnce this potential is unlocked, AI is expected to create significant business opportunities for technology companies to produce premium products and, in turn, boost their stocks.\n\nBesides, the development of smart devices is contributing to the growth of the AI space, as they require computing and learning capabilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition, and video analytics.\n\nThese functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, all of which create favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry’s growth.\n\nMoreover, while uncertainty over rate cuts raised concerns, the Federal Reserve said earlier this month that any further interest rate hike is unlikely. High-interest rates have a negative impact on growth assets such as technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve’s comments were cheered by investors.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI thathave a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 52.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 7.4% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare and others.\n\nAlphabet’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 30.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 11.8% over the past 60 days. GOOGL presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 85% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture. SMCI’s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI emphasizes superior product design and uncompromising quality control to produce industry-leading serverboards, chassis and server systems.\n\nSuper Micro Computer has an expected earnings growth rate of 99.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 8.3% over the last 60 days.

        "title": "Palo Alto (PANW) to Report Q3 Earnings: What to Expect?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks PANW is scheduled to report its third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 20.\n\nPalo Alto projects its fiscal third-quarter revenues in the range of $1.95-$1.98 billion, which suggests a year-over-year increase of 13-15%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.97 billion, which implies growth of 14.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.24-$1.26 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PANW’s non-GAAP earnings is pegged at $1.25 per share, which indicates an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.10.\n\nPalo Alto’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.8%.\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nPalo Alto’s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is expected to boost its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to contribute to the quarterly performance.\n\nThe growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 2% and 4% ($2.3-$2.35 billion) in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nMoreover, the increased use of the cloud and remote networks in a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks. This is leading to a rise in the demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.\n\nPalo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud and Xpanse, which encompasses the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal third quarter as well.\n\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto’s products by government organizations. The company’s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.\n\nThis FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector’s trust in PANW’s IoT security solutions. This is anticipated to have encouraged the adoption of its products during the period in discussion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigher software mix, normalization in the supply-chain environment and efficiencies in customer support are anticipated to have aided the gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, better cost management is expected to drive the third-quarter bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Palo Alto this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nThough PANW currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS and Agilent Technologies A have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.38%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 20.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s first-quarter earnings stands at $5.50 per share, which indicates a year-over-year improvement of 404.6%. It is estimated to report revenues of $24.19 billion, which suggests a jump of approximately 236.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%. The company is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 30. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 28.2%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zscaler’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents per share, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 35.4%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $535.6 million, which calls for a year-over-year rise of 27.9%.\n\nAgilent Technologies is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 29. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.42% at present. Agilent Technologies’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.19 per share, which suggests a decrease of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.27. Agilent Technologies’ quarterly revenues are estimated to decline 8% to $1.58 billion from $1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

OLLI.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the global leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Though Nvidia has been growing for years due to revenue streams from PC graphics and gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms, the company has experienced exploding, “hockey stick” like growth for its artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that support high-performance computing (HPC). Revenue from Nvidia’s complex and powerful chips has lifted NVDA to a more than $2 trillion market cap and has solidified the company as the undisputed leader in the AI space, far ahead of semiconductor competitors like Inteland Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nBlackwell Platform Is a Bullish Catalyst\n\nThough Nvidia is already the dominant player in the AI space, visionary CEO Jensen Huang is not sitting back and enjoying the success. Instead, NVDA recently announced the Blackwell platform, “enabling organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.”\n\nAs mega-cap tech companies race to AI dominance, large language models like Open AI and Microsoft’sChatGPT will require efficiency for two reasons. First, large language models like ChatGPT require GPUs to “train” their models. Presently, companies like OpenAI and Alphabetare engaged in an AI arms race. Furthermore, by 2030 the data center share of electricity will be the equivalent of the electricity consumption of one-third of U.S. homes (which explains the recent bull trends in utility stocks like Vistra.\n\nExplosive Growth Expected\n\nEarnings, which have already been growing like a weed, are expected to increase by a triple-digit clip over the next two quarters and juicy 84.72% next year.\n\nTechnical View\n\nPrice is the ultimate “tell” in investing because it represents real supply and demand. From this standpoint, Nvidia is bullish for two reasons:\n\nRelative Strength: While some AI-related stocks like Arm Holdingsand Super Micro Computerare well off their 52-week highs, NVDA is suffering a mild correction and is within 10% of its all-time high – a sign of relative strength.\n\nStory continues\n\nShakeout + Regain of 10-week MA: If investing were easy, everybody would be rich. Every so often stocks need to “shake the tree” and get rid of “weak hands” before resuming higher. NVDA plunged nearly 10% in mid-May before ripping back above the 10-week moving average (a level that has contained most of the stock’s multiyear move).\n\nValuation is Still Cheap\n\nAmateur investors often make the mistake of conflating an appreciating stock price with a company being “overvalued.” However, NVDA’s Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio is near a multiyear low and remains cheap.\n\nEarnings ESP + Zacks Rank #1\n\nOur extensive, in-house back test shows that stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #3 or better and have a positive Earnings Surprise Prediction (ESP) score tend to beat earnings and outperform. Furthermore, while Wall Street is bullish on the stock, NVDA has beaten consensus estimates in 18 of the past 20 quarters.\n\nCloud Demand\n\nData center demand is not only due to AI, but also to cloud growth. Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms and Baiduare all investing billions in expanding their cloud presence.\n\nEV Opportunities\n\nAs automakers strive for autonomous vehicles, Nvidia stands to benefit. The company is working with more than 320 automakers, suppliers, and automotive research institutions to develop AI systems for self-driving vehicles.\n\nBottom Line\n\nData center and AI growth, top-tier fundamentals, and new product offerings are just a few reasons to own Nvidia, the true market leader.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Peabody Energy is a preeminent coal producer engaged in the mining, processing, and the sale of coal through 17 operations, mainly in the United States and Australia. Peabody Energy mostly mines and processes thermal coal, which is utilized for power generation, and metallurgical coal, which is utilized in steel production.\n\nGlobal Coal Demand is Expected to Decline\n\nIn 2020, Coal stocks like BTU, Arch Resources and Warrior Met Coal were on the brink of collapse as demand plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and investor concerns about investors attempting to replace the entire industry with clean energy alternatives. Since then, several coal companies have gone bankrupt. Nevertheless, the ones that survived enjoyed recovering earnings and soaring stock prices.\n\nHowever, despite the impressive recovery in coal demand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees global coal demand leveling off and cooling over the next few years and into 2026. The late 2023 report marks the first time the IEA has predicted a drop in global coal consumption. The reasons for the lower expectations include:\n\nU.S. & EU Demand to Slow:\n\nThough demand in developing nations like India and China is growing in the single digits, slowing demand in the European Union and the United States will likely outweigh the demand.\n\nGlobal Demand Seen Slowing Regardless of Clean Energy Agenda\n\nThe IEA expects global demand to fall by 2.3% by 2026,“even in the absence of governments announcing and implementing stronger clean energy and climate policies. This decline is set to be driven by the major expansion of renewable energy capacity coming online in the three years to 2026.”\n\nChina Renewable Energy Growth\n\nChina is responsible for the most coal demand globally. However, the IEA sees demand falling as clean energy solutions are rolled out in the country.\n\nRelative Weakness\n\nBehind market direction, industry group health is the most critical driver of individual stocks. Currently, the Coal industry is ranked in the bottom 2% (245 out of 251) of all industries tracked by Zacks. Meanwhile, BTU is exhibiting concerning relative weakness compared to its peers. BTU is -8.4%, while the coal industry as a whole is -3% year-to-date.\n\nRevenue Growth is Slowing\n\nFundamentals must grow for coal stocks to maintain their momentum. Unfortunately, BTU is experiencing slowing revenue growth.\n\nInconsistent EPS Surprise History\n\nBTU has missed Zacks Consensus estimates in three out of the past four quarters – a signal that earnings are stabilizing.\n\nBottom Line\n\nSlowing demand, underperformance, and a weak industry group are reasons to avoid this coal producer.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nHow to Play Walmart (WMT) Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nWith a chunk of the earnings season behind us, the spotlight remains on the retail sector. While major retailers are lined up for their quarterly releases this month, the focus currently lies on the omnichannel behemoth, Walmart Inc., which is all set to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results before the opening bell on May 16.\n\nWe believe that it’s a good time for investors to assess both the potential advantages and risks linked to investing in this retail powerhouse. While Walmart shows promise due to its strong omnichannel strategy, diverse operations and significant market position, there are also inherent uncertainties that come with investing in this supermarket giant.\n\nAnalysts' expectations for WMT’s upcoming release paint quite a bright picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues stands at $159.2 billion, which suggests 4.5% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago period. The consensus estimate for earnings per share has remained unchanged at 52 cents over the past 30 days, which indicates a jump of 6.1% from the year-ago period earnings of 49 cents.\n\nIt is also worth noting that leading up to its upcoming release, Walmart has made headlines by announcing job cuts and requesting remote employees to transition back to office spaces, per a media report. This move aligns with the company's ongoing efforts to streamline operations, as it aims for approximately 65% of its stores to be automated by the end of fiscal 2026.\n\nAll said, the decision to invest in Walmart ahead of its quarterly earnings release demands a thoughtful evaluation of both potential rewards and inherent risks.\n\nWalmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc. Quote\n\nWeighing Prospects and Risks\n\nWalmart stands out for its strong position, benefiting from a highly diversified business across various segments, markets and channels. The company has been benefiting from an increase in both in-store and digital channel traffic, reflecting its adept navigation of the evolving retail landscape. Walmart's commitment to innovation and adaptability, particularly in the e-commerce space, has been a major driver. Gains from higher-margin ventures, such as advertising, are also noteworthy.\n\nThe focus on enhancing its physical store fleet has been instrumental, serving customers directly while also supporting a significant portion of e-commerce sales. Store remodeling initiatives have helped upgrade stores with advanced in-store and digital innovations. Concurrently, Walmart has strengthened its e-commerce operations through acquisitions, partnerships, and improved payment and delivery systems, exemplified by services like Express On-Demand Early Morning Delivery, the Spark Driver platform, investments in DroneUp and the Walmart+ membership program.\n\nHowever, challenges stemming from market saturation and increased competition from online retailers may temper Walmart's growth trajectory. The company's extensive presence across the United States has led to market saturation in many areas, particularly urban and densely populated regions. Additionally, stiff competition from e-commerce giant Amazon has intensified competition in the marketplace.\n\nValuation Picture & Zacks Model\n\nWalmart exhibits a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 25.07, which is above the Retail – Supermarkets industry's average of 23.22 but below its five-year high of 27.24. While the current valuation is above the industry average, the gap from its historical high indicates potential room for growth. Investors may view this as an opportunity, considering Walmart’s strong market position and excellent growth prospects.\n\nRecent market movements show Walmart’s shares rising by 7.1% in the last three months compared with the industry's growth of 8%. Currently trading at $60.41, the company is poised to potentially surpass its 52-week high of $61.66, as our proven model predicts that Walmart is likely to beat earnings estimates in the upcoming release.\n\nThe combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here. Walmart has an Earnings ESP of +1.65% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nBright Horizons Ahead\n\nA look at the road ahead for Walmart reveals a rather positive picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the current and next fiscal year stands at $672.6 billion and $699.6 billion, which suggests 3.8% and roughly 4% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $2.36 and $2.55 for the current and next fiscal years, which calls for an increase of 6.3% and 8.1%, respectively.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are two other companies worth considering, as our model shows that these also have the correct combination to beat on earnings this time:\n\nThe TJX Companies currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #2. TJX is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $12.5 billion, which indicates 5.8% growth from that reported in the prior-year quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TJX’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at 87 cents, which implies 14.5% growth from the year-ago quarter's actuals. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. TJX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.3%, on average.\n\nOllie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.08% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register top-and-bottom-line increases when it posts first-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ollie's Bargain’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $503.8 million, which calls for growth of 9.7% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ollie's Bargain’s quarterly earnings of 65 cents suggests a rise of 32.7% from the year-ago quarter’s levels. OLLI has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.3%, on average.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Wallet recovery firms buzz as locked-out crypto investors panic in bitcoin boom",
        "content": "By Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian\n\nMay 15 (Reuters) - The recent surge in bitcoin prices has the phones at crypto wallet recovery firms ringing off the hook, as retail investors locked out of their digital vaults make frantic calls to regain access to their accounts.\n\nCryptocurrencies exist on a decentralized digital ledger known as blockchain and investors may opt to access their holdings either through a locally stored software wallet or a hardware wallet, to avoid risks related to owning crypto with an exchange, as in the case of the former FTX.\n\nLosing access to a crypto wallet is a well-known problem. Investors forgetting their intricate passwords is a primary reason, but loss of access to two-factor authentication devices, unexpected shutdowns of cryptocurrency exchanges and cyberattacks are also common.\n\nWallet passwords are usually alphanumeric and the wallet provider also offers a set of randomized words, known as \"seed phrases\", for additional security - both these are known only to the user. If investors lose the passwords and phrases, access to their wallets is cut off.\n\nWith bitcoin prices regaining traction since last October and hitting a record high of $73,803.25 in March, investors seem to be suffering from a classic case of FOMO, or the fear of missing out.\n\nReuters spoke to nearly a dozen retail investors who had lost access to their crypto wallets. Six of them contacted a recovery services firm and managed to regain access to their holdings.\n\n\"What would be driving this trend is the fact that bitcoin prices are at $60,000, not $30,000... it's just pure economics,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"People who are missing their crypto for one reason or another, or those who don't have access to their crypto, are very much incentivized to get it back.\"\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency has surged 161% in the past two quarters, on hopes of a cut in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and optimism around the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nBOOM IN RECOVERY REQUESTS\n\nA Switzerland-based firm that uses Nvidia's graphic processing unit cards to run artificial intelligence models to access stranded wallets saw requests jump tenfold in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period.\n\n\"We have seen a spike (in requests to unlock wallets) every time the price changes dramatically,\" said a top executive at the firm who did not want to be named.\n\nReWallet, a Germany-based wallet recovery services provider, saw a 334% jump in requests in the previous quarter and logged a record-high number of requests in early March, when bitcoin prices touched an all-time peak.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm estimates that about 20% of the total 19 million bitcoins in circulation, as of March 13, are likely inactive and now worth around $237 billion.\n\nU.S.-based Wallet Recovery Services saw a 30% bump in requests this year as of mid-April.\n\nRecovery services provided by firms do not come cheap. ReWallet and WRS charge a 20% fee on the wallets' contents, with the caveat being they get paid only upon retrieval.\n\nINVESTORS' WALLET RECOVERY ATTEMPTS\n\n\"I was simply worried that I would no longer have access (to my wallet) and thus lose my bitcoins forever,\" said an investor living in Germany, who declined to be named. \"Of course, the high bitcoin price was an incentive to finally tackle this.\"\n\nAnother Switzerland-based investor, who also requested anonymity, said, \"I had secured the wallet with passphrases and couldn't remember it. I tried again and again and created various lists with possible alternatives, but unfortunately without success.\"\n\nRecounting ReWallet's retrieval of his bitcoin holdings, now worth over $300,000, he said, \"It was an indescribably great feeling. I'm retiring in one-and-a-half years and I now feel financially well positioned.\"\n\nSpeaking about investors' struggles, Ralf Wintergerst, chief executive of German security technology firm Giesecke+Devrient said, \"Looking ahead, there is a growing trend towards solutions that mitigate the key management problem inherent in self-custody.\"\n\n\"This could entail the use of multi-signature wallets, or other decentralized recovery mechanisms to distribute responsibility and enhance security.\" (Reporting by Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI Battle Ahead: Why Palantir Stock Faces a Tough Road in 2025",
        "content": "PalantirTechnologies (NYSE:PLTR) first-quarter results show that the company’s revenue and customer base are growing rapidly. Still, PLTR’s profits remain quite low considering the company’s high-flying stock. And the company continues to face multiple, strong, worrisome threats. Moreover, the Street appears to have lost its love for Palantir stock. In light of these points, I continue to urge investors to unload the company’s shares.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth Paired With Continued, Relatively Low Profits\n\nIn the first quarter, the company’s revenue climbed 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its customer count jumped an impressive 42% year-over-year (YOY). And the increase of both of those metrics also accelerated compared to Q4, when its top line and customer base rose by 19.6% YOY and 32% YOY, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, Palantir’s sales from U.S. companies increased 40% YOY, down from the 70% YOY increase in that area in Q4. I’ll have more to say about that in a minute.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the profit side, the company’s Q1 operating income (OI) came in at $81 million. That represents a large increase, in percentage terms, compared with the $4.1 million of OI that the firm generated in Q1 of 2023.\n\nBut it’s worth noting that the $81 million of OI equates to $324 million on an annualized basis. And since the market capitalization of Palantir stock is $46.5 billion, the name is changing hands at a huge, annualized OI-to-price ratio of 143.5 times.\n\nPalantir Is Facing Multiple Tough Threats\n\nPalantir’s claim to fame and biggest growth engine is the company’s software that helps firms and government agencies easily deploy and manage AI tools. But as I’ve pointed out in past columns, numerous companies, including IBM (NYSE:IBM), C3.ai (NYSE:AI), and Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) have developed similar software. And three powerhouses — Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) — are working together to help firms deploy AI systems.\n\nSo Palantir has a huge amount of competition with which to contend on the AI front. That increasing competition is probably one major factor that caused the YOY increase in its overall revenue from the U.S. private sector to fall to 40% last quarter from 70% in Q4 of 2023.\n\nAnother threat facing Palantir is cost-cutting by the U.S. federal government. Whether President Trump or President Biden wins a second term, Washington is going to have to get serious about cutting costs starting next year. That’s because interest on the federal debt alone now equals 40% of personal income taxes collected. And with interest rates high and debt rising, that situation will only become more catastrophic as the years go by.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, either Trump and Biden will be lame ducks who cannot run for another term. That makes this a good opportunity for the political parties to finally reduce federal spending. I expect Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement that will rely primarily on reducing Social Security and Medicare spending for future beneficiaries to cut the deficit. I think they will have to make some cuts in other areas to say groups besides future middle-class retirees are sacrificing. As a result, Congress could meaningfully cut federal agencies’ IT budgets. S uch a decision could significantly hurt Palantir, which gets a large chunk of its revenue from Washington.\n\nThe Street Is Becoming Less Enamored With Palantir Stock\n\nBarron’s noted that, although the Street analysts were “generally positive” about Q1 results, most think that the valuation of Palantir stock is “demanding.” Also, two major banks — Citi and Japan’s Mizuho — kept “neutral” ratings on the shares, while investment bank William Blair maintained an “underperform” rating on the name.\n\nIn another indication that the Street is less thrilled with Palantir than it once was, the name sank 21% between May 6, the day that it reported its Q1 results, and the market close on May 13.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer’s wife held a long position in NOW. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "3 Unbeatable Stocks to Ride the AI Wave Long-Term",
        "content": "Even as the heat around artificial intelligence cools slightly, it’s clear that advanced computing and AI-centric solutions will continue to propel innovation and market growth for years to come. However, while prominent AI stocks to buy like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) capture most of the media and market spotlight, several overlooked AI stocks are methodically laying the groundwork for significant future expansion.\n\nIdentifying these hidden gems can be challenging. These companies don’t typically prioritize AI as their primary selling point, meaning they don’t heavily advertise AI capabilities across their product lines — a stark contrast to companies that may overuse AI terminology, slapping the label onto any basic automation function whether it applies or not.\n\nThe three AI stocks to buy outlined here exemplify this market segment, quietly innovating without fanfare.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG) may be volatile, but it’s making waves in a particularly promising sector: education and EdTech. Traditional educational institutions, even prestigious ones, face increased scrutiny and skepticism. I believe that AI and emerging remote work and learning technologies will drive the next major social revolutions. Chegg is at the forefront of integrating AI into various learning applications with its new AI-powered personalized learning assistant, built on OpenAI’s GPT API. This tool is one of the few successful AI applications in the EdTech sector.\n\nHowever, pioneering new and next-gen tools can be expensive and yield unpredictable results early in their development. Chegg’s shares have fallen over 30% since the start of 2024, following an earnings report that fell short of expectations with a conservative outlook.\n\nNevertheless, Chegg’s management remains committed to its AI EdTech initiatives, describing the development as “ongoing and iterative.” They caution that it’s too early to forecast when revenue and margin growth will resume due to R&D costs. Despite these challenges, Chegg’s current price and valuation make it an attractive AI stock to buy for investors looking to leverage EdTech’s AI-centric future.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit (RDDT) website displayed on smartphone hidden in jeans pocket\n\nThough inarguably overvalued, Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) has significant untapped potential driving its status among AI stocks to buy: a vast repository of user-generated content, which includes long-form writing, questions and debates. This makes Reddit an invaluable resource for third-party AI companies looking to train their models on rich, diverse data. It also lets Reddit remain agnostic as to which AI company or companies dominate the landscape — they’re selling upstream materials to those firms, much as a lithium supplier cares little about which electric vehicle company dominates the field.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis strategy has a basis in past actions. As early as 2019, certain Reddit communities (subreddits) were involved in testing early versions of GPT models, where bots trained on this technology interacted within the platform to refine the AI’s capabilities. These bots engaged in simulated conversations that mimicked real user interactions, although the quality of their responses was rudimentary compared to today’s more sophisticated AI interactions.\n\nIs data the new oil? We’ve heard that phrase repeated constantly over the past decade. Still, it’s more apt today than before as AI technology progresses and the demand for high-quality training data increases. With their extensive and varied content, platforms like Reddit are well-positioned to benefit from this long-term trend, turning their user-generated content into a strategic asset for the burgeoning AI industry.\n\nGetty Images (GETY) Image of Getty Image logo on gray background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/360b\n\nGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is an overlooked stock — period. The visual media company offers a wide range of stock photos and journalism photography targeting creatives, media companies and corporate marketing, design and communications. But the stock’s unique potential lies in its partnership with Nvidia, making it one of today’s overlooked AI stocks to buy.\n\nReleased in January, Getty’s Nvidia-powered generative AI image creator helps professionals and amateurs alike create customized and unique images in a simpler interface than, say, Midjourney’s Discord-centered platform. Most importantly, for the professional class, images licensed from the platform come with significant legal coverage. This helps shield users from copyright or similar lawsuits, particularly salient as OpenAIbattles accusations of illegal data and info harvesting. Large-scale and corporate clients will likely want as many protections moving forward as possible, and few (if any) offer the same coverage as Getty Images.\n\nGetty’s recent earnings report showed a small drag on both sales and income. Still, subscription rates increased by about 5% to 55.4% of the company’s net revenue — and its AI offerings will likely contribute to that stat accelerating further.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has wowed investors over the past few years with its triple-digit earnings growth and explosive share-price performance. And that's helped the company reach $2.26 trillion in market value. The reason behind all of the excitement? Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven their ability to power the most crucial of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks -- such as the training of large language models (LLMs) -- and the company now holds about 80% of the AI chip market.\n\nThis chip giant still has plenty of great days ahead, but two other AI stocks could join it in the $2 trillion club and even go on to surpass Nvidia's market value. These players have solid moats protecting their main businesses and have delivered strong earnings over time. Now their focus on AI could launch a whole new era of growth.\n\nWhile AI offers these players a boost in the coming years, increasing competition in the AI chip market may make it more difficult for Nvidia to grow as quickly as in recent times. Analysts expect annual growth of about 35% from Nvidia over the coming five years -- down from annual growth of more than 50% over the past five years.\n\nMy prediction is the following two AI growth stocks may be worth more than the chip giant in five years... Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in the two high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, with a solid moat thanks to its brand strength. And these businesses have helped the company generate billions of dollars in earnings annually.\n\nThough Amazon reported an annual loss in 2022 -- the first in nearly a decade as it struggled with rising inflation -- it quickly revamped its cost structure and delivered earnings growth a year later. Its efforts made Amazon more efficient and set the company on the right track for more growth down the road too.\n\nAmazon also should benefit from its investments in AI, particularly through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. AWS is the world's leading cloud-computing provider, putting it in the position to win as more and more companies launch AI projects. Everyone's talking about AI these days, but it's important to remember we're at the beginning of this story, so much of the growth is yet to come.\n\nAWS has prepared by offering customers all of the tools they need for their projects, from a wide range of chips for every budget to a fully managed service offering access to top LLMs.\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his recent letter to shareholders. AWS, historically Amazon's biggest profit driver, recently reached a $100 billion annual revenue-run rate and reported double-digit growth in sales and operating income in the recent quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Amazon's market value totals $1.94 trillion, but it could easily increase 16% to reach Nvidia's market capitalization -- and even surpass it -- as demand for AI projects gain momentum.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nYou may use Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) every day without even thinking about it. Meta is the owner of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these apps daily. One reason Meta's moat is so strong is users know that if they leave Meta's social media for a rival platform, their contacts may not follow.\n\nAdvertisers understand this, so they flock to Meta with their marketing dollars, and this has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue annually for the technology company.\n\nIn recent times, Meta has put the focus on AI and has even said that its biggest investment area this year is in this high-growth technology. The company aims to launch AI across its apps, for example, by making an AI assistant available for every sort of use, from leisure to professional. Meta recently got the ball rolling by launching Meta AI, a conversational assistant in several English-speaking markets.\n\nThis should translate into revenue growth as users spend more time on Meta's apps, prompting advertisers to keep coming back and even increase their spending.\n\nMeta hasn't yet monetized its investment in AI, but the positive point here, as I mentioned above regarding Amazon, is that AI growth truly is in the early stages. That means AI could offer Meta a significant growth driver down the road.\n\nMeta today is worth $1.18 trillion, so it would have to gain about 90% to reach Nvidia's market value. That might seem like a lot, but Meta may have what it takes to make the leap. After all, over the past five years, the company's revenue and market value climbed 90% and 100%, respectively. So as the AI investment starts to bear fruit and boost earnings, Meta could replicate that performance -- and surpass Nvidia in the years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Bought 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks, and 1 Is Absolutely Soaring",
        "content": "In the space of just 18 months, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) market capitalization has grown from $360 billion to over $2.2 trillion, making it the third largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for the majority of that value creation. Nvidia designs the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their AI models.\n\nThose chips sent Nvidia's data center revenue soaring 217% during fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), and that momentum should continue in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe AI opportunity is rapidly expanding, and Nvidia is using some of its wealth to invest in other companies in the industry. Nvidia's headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia bought a handful of AI stocks at the end of 2023\n\nNvidia filed a 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14 revealing new holdings in five different stocks:\n\nArm Holdings, which designs processors for the world's largest chip companies. Nvidia invested approximately $147 million in this stock, which was more than it invested in the other four combined. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which uses AI to accelerate the drug discovery process. Nano-X Imaging, which uses the technology to enhance medical imaging to improve patient outcomes. TuSimple Holdings, a developer of autonomous driving technologies for the trucking industry. SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), a specialist in conversational AI technologies.\n\nDespite Arm being Nvidia's largest position, SoundHound AI takes the cake for best performer. It's up 160% in 2024 so far, which means Nvidia has more than doubled its money since buying it in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nAt SoundHound's current stock price of $5.50, Nvidia's position is worth around $9 million. While that doesn't sound like a big number, SoundHound is only a $1.8 billion company. But it's packed with potential, so should investors follow Nvidia's lead?\n\nA conversational AI specialist\n\nAI went mainstream in 2023 with applications like ChatGPT, which allowed users to enter text-based prompts to instantly generate text, images, videos, and computer code. SoundHound specializes in conversational AI, which uses voice recognition to create a number of useful business applications.\n\nRestaurant chains like Applebee's, Chipotle, and Krispy Kreme use its technology to take customer orders in-store, over the phone, and in the drive-thru at a growing number of their locations, which reduces the workload on employees.\n\nAnd SoundHound's Employee Assist tool allows workers to hold conversations with an AI virtual assistant, which is available to answer questions at a moment's notice whether it relates to in-store policies or instructions for making menu items.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's technology is also powering the voice assistants in a growing number of new cars, from manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Stellantis (which owns Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge). The Vehicle Intelligence application can walk drivers through their car's features, and the Chat AI application can answer general questions about the weather, sports scores, and nearby attractions.\n\nSoundHound also has a deal with Nvidia Drive, which is an end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform for car manufacturers. Nvidia is using SoundHound to create a powerful voice assistant that doesn't require internet connectivity, making it far more private because data isn't exposed externally.\n\nSoundHound generates little revenue, but it's growing quickly\n\nSoundHound AI generated $11.6 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), and while that's a relatively small number, it was a 73% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nThe company also issued a modest increase to its forecast for the full year, and it now expects to deliver a record-high $71 million in total revenue. That would represent year-over-year growth of 55%, an acceleration from the 47% growth it delivered in 2023.\n\nIt also shored up its long-term revenue-earning potential, with an order backlog worth $682 million at the end of the first quarter -- an 80% increase from the year-ago period. This backlog is expected to convert into revenue over a period of seven years, on average, and in as little as four years for some subscription-based customers.\n\nHowever, Chief Financial Officer Nitesh Sharan says the backlog figure only factors in deals that have a reasonable chance to convert into revenue based on the facts at hand today, and not the potential opportunities in the pipeline. For example, he recently told investors the company has over 100,000 store locations in its sales pipeline, which aren't in the backlog data.\n\nWhile this growth is impressive, the company is in the scale-up phase, which requires significant capital investment. As a result, it lost over $33 million at the bottom line in the first quarter. That was 20% larger than its loss from the same quarter last year, despite generating significantly more revenue now.\n\nDespite Nvidia's presence, SoundHound stock is a speculative bet\n\nSoundHound only had $226 million in cash on hand at the end of the quarter, so it can't sustain its growing losses indefinitely. It entered a new at-the-market facility during that period, which will allow management to sell new shares to investors to raise money when appropriate. But only time will tell whether that will be enough to see the company through to profitability.\n\nOn a positive note, management believes it could generate a profit during 2025 on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). However, that is far from a sure thing, and in my opinion, investors are paying a hefty price relative to the risk at hand.\n\nBased on the company's $50.8 million in trailing 12-month revenue and its market cap of $1.8 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 35. By comparison, Nvidia trades at a P/S of 36, but it's growing its revenue even more quickly than SoundHound, and the company is highly profitable. Microsoft, which is a leader in AI software, trades at a P/S of just 13.6.\n\nSo, should investors buy SoundHoundAI just because Nvidia did? At the current price, it's a tough recommendation. Besides, Nvidia's stake is only worth $9 million -- if it went to zero, the $2.2 trillion chip giant wouldn't even flinch.\n\nTherefore, buying the stock should be reserved for investors with a very high risk tolerance. Otherwise, it might be best to wait on the sidelines for a better price, or until the company proves it can turn a profit.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are firmly in control on Wall Street. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 19%, 36%, and 56%, as well as hit fresh all-time highs.\n\nWhile certain sectors and industries have played a role in pushing the broader market higher, the \"Magnificent Seven\" are attributed with putting the weight of Wall Street on their proverbial backs and lifting the stock market to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's view of the Magnificent Seven stocks is mixed\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from each of these businesses handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, they provide well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright moats within their respective industries.\n\nFor example, Alphabet's Google accounts for nearly 91% of worldwide internet search share, while Amazon's e-commerce marketplace oversaw close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also the respective No.'s 1, 2, and 3 in cloud infrastructure service market share by enterprise spend.\n\nDespite the clear-cut catalysts the Magnificent Seven stocks bring to the table, not all Wall Street analysts share an optimistic view for their future. Based on bottom of the barrel price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three Magnificent Seven components could plunge by up to 86%.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied downside of 24%\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven constituent that at least one analyst believes could meaningfully decline in the not-too-distant future is social media colossus Meta Platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski, who often takes a contrarian view on some of Wall Street's leading businesses, set a price target of just $360 on shares of Meta. This suggests 24% downside to come, based on the $476.20-per-share closing price, as of May 10.\n\nAccording to Slowinski, Meta lacks new revenue streams, when compared to the other companies spending big on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This lack of new revenue channels, coupled with the company's forecast of higher capital expenditures tied to AI, have Slowinski believing Meta could underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Meta is the undisputed leader among social media platforms. It owns the top social media \"real estate\" globally, including the most-visited social site (Facebook), and lured 3.24 billion users to its family of apps on a daily basis during the quarter ended in March. Businesses understand they're not going to reach a broader set of eyeballs on any other social media platform, which tends to afford Meta exceptionally strong ad pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms also benefits from lengthy periods of economic expansion. Since it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, the company would be vulnerable to a recession. At the moment, a few key indicators, including a historic drop in U.S. M2 money supply, do suggest an economic downturn is probable.\n\nHowever, recessions are short-lived. All 12 U.S. recessions since 1945 have endured between two and 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth last for multiple years, and occasionally even stick around for a decade. Ad-driven businesses thrive during these long-winded expansions.\n\nA final reason Slowinski may be forced to eat his words is Meta's balance sheet. The company closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated north of $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations through the first three months of 2024. In other words, it has the capital to take risks and aggressively invest in its future -- even if the payoff from those investments are a few years away from being truly material to its top and bottom line. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 31%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that one Wall Street analyst views as anything but \"magnificent\" is semiconductor behemoth Nvidia.\n\nBased on a February note issued by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, there's concern about demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) peaking in the current year. With the prospect of slower growth on the horizon, Luria's low-water price target of $620 implies a decline of 31% for Nvidia's stock over the coming year.\n\nOn the bright side, Nvidia's GPUs have come to dominate AI-accelerated data centers. With demand handily outpacing supply, strong pricing power helped to more than triple Data Center segment sales in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28).\n\nBut Luria hit the nail on the head when it comes to competition. While most folks might be focused on external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are both rolling out AI-accelerators for enterprise data centers, it's internal competition from Nvidia's top customers that's the far bigger concern.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four-largest customers and comprise in the neighborhood of 40% of its net sales. But these four giants are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if this is purely for complementary purposes, demand for Nvidia's high-powered chips would likely wane after the current fiscal year.\n\nWhat's more, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation over the last three decades that didn't navigate its way through a bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors overestimate the uptake or adoption of new technologies. Since no company has benefited more from the rise of AI, Nvidia would, in theory, be hit the hardest if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nLuria's price target on Nvidia is likely to be reached.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nBut the disaster du jour among Magnificent Seven stocks, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street pundit, is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. Gordon Johnson, the CEO and founder of GLJ Research and longtime Tesla bear, believes shares will reach $23.53.\n\nThis weirdly specific price target was arrived at by applying a multiple of 15 times Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 and working backwards using a 9% discount rate. Keep in mind this price target was issued earlier this year, and Tesla's consensus EPS for 2025 has declined since then. If Johnson's price target were to prove accurate, shares of Tesla would implode by 86% from where they closed on May 10.\n\nTesla has made a habit of proving skeptics wrong. For instance, it's the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit. Tesla recently introduced its fifth mass-production model (Cybertruck) and has the capacity to roll out more than 2 million EVs annually.\n\nHowever, headwinds are most definitely mounting for North America's leading EV company.\n\nAs an example, increasing EV and hybrid competition has coerced Tesla to slash the sales price of its primary production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. CEO Elon Musk has been clear that his company's price strategy is entirely based on demand. But even with these aggressive cuts, Tesla's inventory levels have soared and its operating margins are tumbling.\n\nTesla's efforts to transform into more than just a car company haven't gone swimmingly, either. Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has slowed dramatically, while Services segment gross margin is consistently in the low-to-mid single digits. Meanwhile, more than half of the company's pre-tax income during the March-ended quarter came from unsustainable sources (e.g., interest income and the sale of regulatory tax credits).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Musk has proved to be a tangible liability for the company. Many of Musk's promises, such as Level 5 autonomy and robotaxis, which are already baked into Tesla's valuation, have failed to come to fruition. The longer these claims go unfulfilled, the likelier it is that Tesla's massive valuation premium to other auto stocks will deflate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Both developments might benefit the sector, so it’s important to keep an eye on these top EV stocks to watch.\n\nAround 17 million electric cars are expected to be sold worldwide in 2024; China will lead with 45% of auto sales. What’s more, EVs are also expected to make up one in nine cars sold in the U.S. and one in four cars sold in Europe; in Q1 2024 Americans alone purchased 268,909 new electric vehicles.\n\nAs a further matter, policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will keep powering the sector, expected to grow by 9.82% between 2024 and 2028, reaching $906.7 billion in 2028. Expect both parties to provide further policy recommendations as the 2024 election approaches.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith secular tailwinds powering the sector, the first pick among these quality EV stocks to watch is the first profitable EV startup from China. Next up is a company with backing from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking to produce 57,000 cars this year. Lastly, we’ll discuss an iconic American automaker aiming to make 2 million EVs by 2026.\n\nLi Auto (LI) The steering wheel and dashboard inside Li Auto electric car. Interior of Li Auto EV. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI), known as China’s first profitable EV maker, shipped 28,984 cars in March, 39% more than the year-ago period, complimenting the launch of its first totally electric model, the Li MEGA, in a Spring 2024 launch event.\n\n​This electric MPV debuted in China with much enthusiasm. The MEGA, built on an 800-volt battery-electric platform, costs $77,782 and has multiple engines, a big battery pack for speedy charging and luxury interior choices, including reclining seats and a back entertainment system.\n\nWhat’s more, Li Auto also plans to spend almost $1 billion to build more than 5,000 high-speed EV charge points across China, the country accounts for roughly 60% of EV sales globally.\n\nInvestors will also be excited about Li Auto’s partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which aims to improve technologies for self-driving cars; this market could potentially be worth $62 billion by 2026.\n\nFinally, Li Auto is slashing the prices of all of its models except for the newly released Li L6, heating up the competition in China, especially for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA); no surprise analysts rate the stock a “Strong Buy,” with an 83% upside.\n\nThe Li L7, L8, L9 and the Li Mega MPV all have their prices cut between 18,000 and 30,000 yuan. The Li Mega type has the biggest price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nMuch like Li Auto, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is coming off a great Q1 2024, producing 13,980 vehicles and delivering 13,588 of them. As a result of these numbers, Rivian reiterated plans to make 57,000 cars this year.\n\nThe 57,000-car target is doable, considering the company celebrated the production of its 100,000th electric car in April, thanks to the addition of 623,000 square feet to its main factory site in Normal, Illinois.\n\nFurthermore, Rivian’s smaller and less expensive R2 and R3X models will attract customers looking for competitive prices, as affordability remains the biggest concern in greater EV adoption.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, Rivian’s stock is down 48% in 2024 owing to losing money on each vehicle in the previous several quarters. By 2024, it intends to improve cost management and production efficiency. Rivian’s finances are still robust, with $7.86 billion in cash to fund its present and future expansion, but $16.8 billion in losses within three years makes investors wary.\n\nStill, Rivian is doing all it can to allay these fears; pausing work on a new $5 billion factory in Georgia to save over $2.25 billion. When fully operational, the factory, built on a 2,000-acre plot of land east of Atlanta, could help make up to 400,000 cars each year.\n\nFord (F) Ford (F) trucks lined up on the lot of a Ford dealership.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Ford (NYSE:F) sold 20,233 EVs, up 86%, thanks to healthy sales growth for the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E.\n\nDespite the division’s deficit, Ford is aiming to produce 2 million EVs by 2026 by reducing capital expenses and shifting funds to this area. On top of this, Ford to establish a low-cost EV platform to make cheaper vehicles with larger profits.\n\nFord wants to produce 600,000 electrified vehicles by 2024, therefore its North American assembly sites are being upgraded, including Oakville in Ontario. By 2026, Ford plans to export automobiles from BlueOval City, its advanced automotive manufacturing hub in Tennessee.\n\nMoreover, Ford’s brand-new three-row electric cars, expected to launch in 2027, will help take advantage of new battery technologies.\n\nOverall, Ford’s sales, earnings and cash flow all went up in the first quarter of 2024. Even though the economy is volatile due to sticky inflation and waning EV demand, the Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro divisions will keep its finances stable and help it grow; a 20% upside and “Moderate Buy” rating accentuates Ford’s robustness.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Investing in dividend stocks gives individuals the best of both worlds. You can get stock appreciation and receive steady cash flow. Some corporations offer lower yields but can generate higher total returns than firms with high yields but limited growth opportunities.\n\nWall Street analysts usually gravitate toward companies that are still growing. While analysts aren’t always correct, they do more research than the average investor to draw their conclusions. These are some of the top dividend stocks to buy that are winning positive praise from Wall Street.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is rated as a Strong Buy and has a projected 13% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $340 per share suggests the stock could rally by an additional 22%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fintech firm has a straightforward business model. It makes a percentage of each Visa credit or debit card transaction. People will continue to use their credit and debit cards in any economic cycle, but they will ramp up their spending during strong economies.\n\nVisa’s Q2 FY24 print demonstrated that consumer spending is still strong. Revenue and GAAP net income both increased by 10% year-over-year (YoY). Those growth rates helped the firm achieve an astounding 53.4% net profit margin.\n\nVisa is up 7% year-to-date and has rallied 69% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 30.9 P/E ratio and offers a 0.74% yield. Visa has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 18.05% over the past decade.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is rated as a Strong Buy among 27 analysts and is estimated to have a 9% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $75.99 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 26%.\n\nThe retailer has a vast global presence, including over 10,500 stores in 19 countries. Walmart also has several e-commerce websites, which have strengthened its financials. Global e-commerce sales grew by 23% YoY in Q4 FY24. Overall revenue was up by 5.7% YoY. Walmart’s advertising segment notably grew by 33% YoY in Q4 FY24 but remains a small portion of total revenue.\n\nWalmart offers a 1.37% yield. While the corporation normally hasn’t raised its dividend by any meaningful amount in recent years, Walmart broke that tradition with a 9% dividend hike. It’s the highest dividend hike in more than a decade and marks Walmart’s 51st consecutive year of dividend increases.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a consensus Strong Buy rating from 24 analysts and a projected 9% return based on the average price target. Some analysts are more optimistic and believe the stock can get as high as $1,720 per share. This price target indicates that a 29% gain is possible.\n\nThe semiconductor firm has been delivering exceptional returns for several years. The stock is up 22% year-to-date as it continues to capitalize on AI tailwinds. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the leading AI chipmaker, Broadcom has been gaining traction as well. The stock is up by 381% over the past five years.\n\nThose gains should continue based on the company’s 34% YoY revenue growth in Q1 2024. The VMware acquisition has been fueling Broadcom’s software division and helped the company offer guidance for $50 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue. This figure represents a 40% YoY increase.\n\nBroadcom spent $8.29 billion on stock buybacks in the quarter and issued a quarterly dividend of $5.25 per share. The dividend stock has a 1.57% yield and has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 17.49% over the past five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AVGO.

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet on Tuesday unveiled a product called Trillium in its artificial intelligence data center chip family that it says is nearly five times as fast as its prior version.\n\n\"Industry demand for (machine learning) computer has grown by a factor of 1 million in the last six years, roughly increasing 10-fold every year,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a briefing call with reporters. \"I think Google was built for this moment, we've been pioneering (AI chips) for more than a decade.\"\n\nAlphabet's effort to build custom chips for AI data centers represents one of the few viable alternatives to Nvidia's top-of-the-line processors that dominate the market. Together with the software that is closely tied to Google's tensor processing units (TPUs), the chips have allowed the company to take a significant share of the market.\n\nNvidia commands roughly 80% of the AI data center chip market, and the vast majority of the remaining 20% is various versions of Google's TPUs. The company doesn't sell the chip itself, but rents access through its cloud computing platform.\n\nThe sixth-generation Trillium chip will achieve 4.7 times better computing performance compared with the TPU v5e, according to Google, a chip designed to power the tech that generates text and other media from large models. The Trillium processor is 67% more energy efficient than the v5e.\n\nThe new chip will be available to its cloud customers in \"late 2024,\" the company said.\n\nGoogle's engineers achieved additional performance gains by increasing the amount of high-bandwidth memory capacity and overall bandwidth. AI models require enormous amounts of advanced memory, which has been a bottleneck to further boosting performance.\n\nThe company designed the chips to be deployed in pods of 256 chips that can be scaled to hundreds of pods.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 16.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal second quarter, AMAT expects net sales of $6.50 billion (+/-$400 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.51 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reading.\r\n\r\nApplied Materials projects non-GAAP earnings of $1.79-$2.15 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.96 per share, indicating a decline of 2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The figure has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nAMAT’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 9.43%.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Applied Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Applied Materials, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nStrength in the Applied Global Services (“AGS”) segment is likely to have contributed well to top-line growth of the company in the to-be-reported quarter. AMAT’s growing 200-millimeter business and solid momentum in the subscription business are likely to have driven segmental sales in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter fiscal 2024, Applied Materials’ projection for AGS sales is pegged at $1.50 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pinned at $1.502 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.2%.\r\n\r\nStrengthening of the IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors (“ICAPS”) portfolio is expected to have benefited the company’s Semiconductor Systems segment in the quarter under review. Growth opportunities across specialty nodes and new nodes ramping across foundry, logic, NAND and DRAM are likely to have been positives.\r\n\r\nHowever, a challenging geopolitical scenario due to escalating tensions between the United States and China is expected to have been a major concern for the company. The adverse impacts of restrictions imposed on China tech exports are anticipated to get reflected in the segment’s fiscal second-quarter results.\r\n\r\nFor second-quarter fiscal 2024, the company’s sales projection for Semiconductor Systems is pegged at $4.80 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pinned at $4.802 billion, indicating a decline of 3.5% from the year-ago quarter’s actual.\r\n\r\nComing to the Display and Adjacent Markets segment, AMAT’s projection for this segment’s second-quarter fiscal 2024 sales is pegged at $150 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is also pegged at the same level, indicating a fall of 10.7% from the year-ago quarter’s actual.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Applied Materials this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nApplied Materials has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00% at present.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Google recently partnered with Hewlett Packard HPE to commercialize its 3D video conferencing technology, Project Starline, in 2025.\r\n\r\nWith the HP collaboration, Google plans to integrate this video technology into popular workplace video conferencing services like Google Meet and Zoom by leveraging HP’s expertise in computing.\r\n\r\nThe Starline technology uses advanced computer vision, machine learning and real-time compression to create a “magic window,” allowing life-size participants to make eye contact and perceive depth.\r\n\r\nThis Starline integration into the workplace will foster authentic in-person interactions in hybrid environments, enabling better visual attentiveness, memory recall and an overall sense of presence.\r\n\r\nGoogle is expected to gain solid traction across various enterprises working in a remote or hybrid setting on the back of its latest announcement.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nThe partnership will enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global video conferencing space. Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global video conferencing market is expected to hit $33.04 billion in 2024 and reach $60.2 billion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 7.8% between 2024 and 2032.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Starline integration will bolster Alphabet’s Google Meet capabilities, adding strength to the Google Workspace environment. This, in turn, will boost the Google Cloud segment, which remains a key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have rallied 21.1% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 12.4%.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenues rose 28.4% year over year to $9.6 billion, accounting for 11.9% of the quarter’s total revenues.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Cloud segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.12 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.1%. The consensus estimate for 2025 total revenues is pegged at $329.03 billion, indicating an 11.5% rise year over year.\n\nStiff Competition\n\nThe latest move will also aid this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company to compete well with some notable industry players like Microsoft MSFT and NVIDIA NVDA, which are also making concerted efforts to strengthen their positions in the 3D video conferencing space.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nRecently, Microsoft launched Mesh virtual meeting spaces, allowing workers to interact in three-dimensional environments using a virtual reality headset. These spaces can be accessed via a regular PC, with users controlling a personalized avatar.\r\n\r\nMesh provides a co-presence experience for employees, allowing them to customize 3D environments with a no-code editor and a Unity-based toolkit, enhancing hybrid working arrangements by addressing limitations.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA, on the other hand, strengthened its foothold in the video conferencing space with NVIDIA Maxine. The Maxine AI Developer Platform enhances real-time video conferencing applications with AI-driven features, enhancing user flexibility, engagement and efficiency, available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA also announced upcoming feature updates to the Maxine platform with the introduction of Maxine 3D, a cloud micro-service that enhances 3D video conferencing engagement with real-time NeRF technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Cheap Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is rapidly gaining traction, and investors are scrambling to get in on the action with cheap metaverse stocks. As technology continues to advance, the concept of a fully immersive, interconnected virtual world is becoming increasingly tangible. These cheap metaverse stocks should be on every investors’ radar.\n\nAlthough the technology so far has not met many investors’ expectations, I feel that we are just beginning to tap into the potential of the industry. We are using ‘metaverse-like’ technologies increasingly in our everyday lives: from cryptocurrencies to NFTs to VR/AR and much more. It could be a matter of time before these brands lift off to new heights, thus making them comparably undervalued.\n\nSo for this article, here are seven cheap metaverse stocks for investors to buy for May. I believe that these brands will be strong performers in the future, and therefore won’t stay cheap for much longer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) operates a platform where users can create and play games. It has a vast user base and continues to focus on monetization strategies and partnerships, such as those with high-profile brands for advertising.\n\nThis year, RBLX has set a financial guidance with expected bookings of approximately $4.03 billion, up from analysts’ expectations of $3.98 billion, and aims for an adjusted EBITDA of around $490 million. The company plans to cap its capital expenditures related to infrastructure at about $100 million and anticipates a share dilution between 3% and 4%.\n\nAdditionally, RBLX is targeting a yearly growth in bookings of over 20% from 2025 to 2027, with an improvement in margins of 100 to 300 basis points annually over the same period​.\n\nLooking back at 2023, RBLX reported significant financial metrics including a 38% year-over-year increase in revenue for the third quarter, reaching $713.2 million. Despite these gains, the company reported a net loss of $277.2 million for the quarter.\n\nTrading at just 6.7 times sales, RBLX could be one of those undervalued metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Unity basically provides some of the “picks and shovels” that allow the metaverse to come to life.\n\nThis year,  the company aims to support creators across the entire game development cycle with new AI features and a first look at Unity 6. They are also launching Unity Cloud, a platform aimed at broadening the usability of Unity’s tools in cloud environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also provided a financial outlook for 2024, projecting revenues between $1.76 billion to $1.80 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $425 million.\n\nUnity reported strong revenue growth, with a 38% increase year-over-year, and continued to invest in technology that advances its capabilities in real-time 3D content creation.\n\nStocks like U that provide the 3D engines for the metaverse to thrive may become in hot demand in later years, and of course it also benefits from the growth headwinds of the expanding gaming market as well.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its advanced graphics processing units that are essential for gaming and professional markets, including applications in the metaverse.\n\nNVDA is still my best pick for one of those undervalued metaverse stocks despite its high multiples for both sales and earnings.\n\nFinancially, NVDA has shown robust performance and has projected even stronger outcomes for the upcoming fiscal year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, NVDA expects revenue to be around $24 billion. This guidance exceeds Wall Street expectations.\n\nNVDA trades at 75 times earnings and 36 times sales. However, the expected growth rates for these metrics make them lower on their forward measures, at 39 times earnings and 22 times sales, respectively. This means that although these metrics may be high today, analysts are confident that NVDA’s fundamentals will improve in the future.\n\nThere’s also some potential for NVDA to do a stock split in the coming years, with it trading for nearly $900 per share at the time of writing, which could incur some indirect benefits to investors.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) provides an e-commerce platform that is expanding into the metaverse by enabling new forms of digital commerce and integration of NFTs.\n\nShopify’s metaverse strategy includes enhancing digital fashion, which represents a significant market opportunity projected to reach $50 billion by 2030. Digital fashion on Shopify allows for the creation of 3D clothing and accessories that are more sustainable and cost-effective.\n\nFinally, Shopify’s President has expressed optimism about the future of retail in the metaverse, emphasizing the importance of integrating commerce features into online platforms.\n\nAs one of the most popular web store builders, SHOP is positioning itself well to take advantage of the rising tide of metaverse products for store owners to tap into, potentially selling them on sites such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nAnalysts are very optimistic about SHOP’s near-term financial performance for FY2024, anticipating that its EPS will rise 944.33% to 1.04 this year. This then makes SHOP one of those undervalued metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) An image of a person wearing a VR headset looking up, a nebulous digital cloud in the upper corner\n\nSource: Vit-Mar/Shutterstock\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:VERS) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in companies heavily involved in the metaverse sector.\n\nThe financial data for VERS reveals an asset total of $5.74M, with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.58%, and a P/E ratio of 25.42. The fund distributes a dividend yield of 0.69% with an annual dividend of $0.28 per share and maintains a conservative payout ratio of 17.44%. It has shown strong performance with a 1-year return of 24.81%.\n\nKey stock holdings of the fund include leading tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) 4.97%, Nvidia 4.60%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 4.55%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 4.55%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 4.38%.\n\nI think that VERS could be one of those undervalued picks for investors to consider if they’d like to invest in a broad-basket of metaverse stocks. It may go well with people who are particularly bullish on the sector, and its intersectionality with AI and robotics could further the bull case.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastly (NYSE:FSLY) operates an edge cloud platform, which is crucial for delivering content with reduced latency. In addition to U, it’s one of those companies that provided the crucial infrastructure to make the metaverse a possibility.\n\nFSLY has issued guidance for 2024, forecasting total revenue to range between $555 million and $565 million. This represents a slight decrease from earlier projections of up to $585 million due to pricing pressures.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Fastly reported a positive operating cash flow of $11.1 million and continues to focus on optimizing operations despite a non-GAAP operating loss.\n\nI still believe that FSLY is an undervalued option for investors. For one, analysts have given the stock a 69.29% predicted upside from its current level. Its EPS also set to surge in the triple digits from FY2026 to FY2027, thus making it comparatively undervalued on an EPS basis.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) A concept image of the metaverse with two young adults wearing virtual reality headsets. undervalued metaverse stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it’s becoming increasingly involved in the metaverse through its NFT marketplace.\n\nThis platform supports NFTs on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain and aims to introduce more blockchains in the future.\n\nCoinbase has also introduced a mobile DApp browser and a DeFi wallet, enhancing user interaction with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading. This includes a co-custodial hot wallet setup.\n\nHowever, in its first quarter of 2024, Coinbase experienced some challenges, notably a consensus revenue estimate reduction of 14%.\n\nStill, I am firmly bullish on COIN’s long-term prospects, and I also think that this year will be the one where cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shine, especially since many FAANG stocks could be seen as too overvalued for most investors’ tastes.\n\nCOIN could then be one of those undervalued metaverse stocks for investors to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups. He then started writing about Australian and U.S. equities for various publications. His work has appeared in MarketBeat, FXStreet, Cryptoslate, Seeking Alpha, and the New Scientist magazine, among others.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks to sell might seem odd, especially in a year with rising corporate earnings, a U.S. presidential election and possibly three rate cuts. However, stock investors must stay watchful, especially with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average up 10% and 4.7%, respectively, far from a bull run.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts expect poor global growth, inflation and geopolitical concerns to hurt the stock market this year. Analysts think a worldwide recession is possible, but high interest rates and geopolitical upheavals make them skeptical of riskier ventures.\n\nElections in 2024 make things even less assured. This year started better than most election years, which could imply better things throughout the year, but you will never know which way the stock markets will react to the election, which is why looking for blue-chip stocks to sell is important.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is up against tough competition in the tech industry, especially when it comes to cloud services and AI systems. Sales went up just 1.47% in Q1 2024, less than the average 10% growth managed by competitors.\n\nEven though the company is trying to change its business plan, its legacy IT services segment is still hurting its overall performance, leading to sluggish capital appreciation of around 30%. For context, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed Friday at around $898, a 210% one-year gain.\n\nTo streamline its business operations, IBM laid off many people in its marketing and communications departments earlier this year, saving the company $3 billion a year by the end of 2024.\n\nArvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, is now focusing on upskilling workers with the latest AI-focused skills. IBM will replace over 8,000 roles as it starts to scale operations through automation and digital intelligence.\n\nKrishna is notable for acknowledging the fact that IBM, though entering the AI race early lost its way a bit. In an interview with CNBC, he said, “I think that’s a fair criticism, that we were slow to monetize and slow to make really consumable the learnings from Watson winning Jeopardy.”\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) xom insider buying\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil‘s (NYSE:XOM) earnings fell across all of its business groups in the first quarter of 2024 due to lower industry refining margins and unfavorable timing effects, especially from derivative mark-to-market impacts, which contributed to this decline.\n\nAnother recent issue is Exxon’s dropping its lawsuit against Santa Barbara County for not obtaining permission to carry oil from offshore installations. According to environmental groups, moving crude oil through sensitive areas could cause oil spills and traffic accidents. Apart from the ecological damage, substantial legal losses can also occur.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother concern is that ExxonMobil intends to search for oil and gas in Guyana and Venezuela’s claimed South American shoreline. Because both countries claim the land, the proposal has raised geopolitical and natural concerns.\n\nFinally, ExxonMobil and other oil firms are also criticized for global carbon emissions. Countries like Guyana, where ExxonMobil is active, use their forests to balance out their emissions while still making oil. As the younger generation becomes more ESG-conscious, such issues can lead to issues for XOM stock in the future.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Landscape Night View of Walgreen's Pharmacy Building Exterior. WBA stock. Blue-chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Mahmoud Suhail / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is down over 35% this year, thanks to narrowing its fiscal year 2024 and slashing its dividend 48%, amid a tough retail environment.\n\nWBA reported a net loss of $67 million in the first quarter, less than the $3.7 billion loss in the same quarter the previous year, but this gain was due to the fact that there wasn’t a big pre-tax charge for opioid-related lawsuits and claims that had changed the numbers from the previous year.\n\nBoots’ retail sales in the UK did really well. Compared to the same quarter last year, pharmacy sales went up 0.8% and retail sales went up 9.8%. Boots.com’s sales went up by 17.5%, which made it stand out. These sales now make up more than 19% of all sales at Boots.\n\nBut in the U.S., the healthcare segment made $1.9 billion in sales, with the VillageMD purchase of Summit Health being the driving factor. In the end, the segment reported an operating loss, which is bad news for Walgreens in a key segment.\n\nThe results come shortly after S&P Global Ratings downgraded Walgreens, saying that recent changes in management, such as the CEO and CFO, put the company’s healthcare business at risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Let's address the elephant in the room: When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), no one's going to forgetNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). I know I certainly won't. The company is the standard bearer for the accelerating adoption of AI thanks to its gold standard AI chips and has thus far been the one undisputed beneficiary of the AI revolution. The stock price has gained more than 200% over the past year alone, led by triple-digit revenue and profit growth in each of the preceding four quarters -- which is memorable, to say the least.\n\nThat said, some investors are already looking to the next wave of AI adoption as the potential windfall expands beyond Nvidia, as it no doubt will. In fact, analysts are particularly bullish on two semiconductor stocks that provide compelling alternatives for investors looking to expand their exposure beyond Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper semiconductor buy No. 1: Arm Holdings\n\nWhile Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) is best known for providing the central processing units (CPUs) that underpin 99% of the world's smartphones, the company's portfolio is much more expansive. Its semiconductors are also staples in personal computers, tablets, smartwatches, networking equipment, and data centers.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI represents the next big opportunity for both Arm and investors, as many of the world's high-end AI processors incorporate Arm's latest technology. Nvidia's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which integrates accelerated CPU and graphics processing unit (GPU) technology to better handle the rigors of AI processing, uses 144 of Arm's version 9 (V9) CPU cores, while Microsoft's data-center chips use more than 100. Furthermore, Arm's customer list includes other well-known players in the AI space, including Advanced Micro Devices and Alphabet's Google, among others.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended March 31), Arm delivered record results. Revenue jumped 47% year over year to $928 million, driven by licensing revenue for its AI chips, while its net income of $224 million jumped 74-fold. Evidence suggests its growth spurt will continue as Arm's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- made up of contractually obligated sales that haven't yet been booked as revenue -- rose 45%. Management also boosted its forecast and is now expecting fiscal 2025 Q1 revenue of $900 million at the midpoint of its guidance, though that well may be conservative.\n\nOf the 29 analysts who issued an opinion on Arm stock in April, 16 rate it a buy or strong buy, and only one recommends selling, citing short-term valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvercore ISI Group analyst Mark Lipacis is the most bullish among his Wall Street colleagues. He has an outperform (buy) rating and a $145 price target on Arm stock, which suggests 33% upside compared to Friday's closing price. The analyst cites the shift to AI, ongoing data-center upgrades, and management's \"beat and raise quarter\" as fueling his enthusiasm.\n\nIf the analyst is right -- and I believe he is -- Arm Holdings gives investors another way to profit from the ongoing adoption of AI.\n\nSuper semiconductor buy No. 2: Micron Technologies\n\nAnother company poised to ride the wave of AI higher is Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU). The company is a leading supplier of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which are indispensable for AI processing and data-center operations.\n\nMicron's customer list is a Who's Who of the industry's largest chipmakers, including Nvidia, AMD, IBM, and Intel, among many others.\n\nThe strength of its recent results caught many investors by surprise. For Micron's fiscal 2024 Q2 (ended Feb. 29), the company generated revenue of $5.82 billion, up 58% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter. Furthermore, robust demand drove strong price increases. That demand is expected to accelerate as the year goes on and as management is guiding for revenue of $6.6 billion in Q3, which would represent year-over-year growth of 76%.\n\nMicron also noted that its HBM3E high-bandwidth memory supply, which has been adopted by Nvidia for its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, is completely sold out for this year, while much of the 2025 supply is spoken for as well. This helps illustrate the strong and growing demand for AI processors and why Micron is a compelling opportunity.\n\nOf the 36 analysts who issued an opinion on Micron stock in April, 30 rate it a buy or strong buy, and not one recommends selling.\n\nBaird analyst Tristan Gerra recently raised his rating to outperform (buy) while assigning a $150 price target on Micron stock, which suggests 24% upside compared to Friday's closing price. The analyst says he sees \"meaningful upside opportunities,\" citing robust pricing power and strong demand from hyperscale cloud operators as driving \"unprecedented outlook\" over the coming 12 to 18 months.\n\nThis gives investors another compelling opportunity to ride the secular tailwinds of AI that aren't named Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before May 22 (and 1 Reason to Sell)",
        "content": "If you're an Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or any type of artificial intelligence (AI) investor, then May 22 is a day you must have circled on your calendar. That's when Nvidia reports Q1 FY 2025 results, which will give investors some clues as to how strong the market is for Nvidia's class-leading GPUs (graphics processing units).\n\nWith how big of a move Nvidia's stock has made after previous earnings releases, it may be wise to consider buying (or selling) some shares before then. I've analyzed Nvidia and come up with three reasons to buy and one to sell. So what should you do before May 22?\n\n1. Reason to buy: Other companies are still talking about AI infrastructure demand\n\nNvidia's primary product, the GPU, is vital for AI model development and training. GPUs allow parallel processing, giving them the ability to do multiple tasks at the same time. This is crucial for training AI models, as multiple iterations must occur before an AI model is usable.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are the best on the market for AI training, and its customers are buying thousands of them at a time to outfit their servers with the best technology possible.\n\nThis caused Nvidia's initial boom last year, but some investors (including myself) were worried that there would be little demand for more capacity once initial demand is satisfied. However, that isn't the case.\n\nMeta Platforms raised its long-term capital expenditure guidance to build more computing power to capture the massive AI opportunity it sees. On its conference call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that they have about 35,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs active, with another 85,000 slated to be up and running by the end of this year.\n\nThe demand for Nvidia's products is still there, which should bode well for it this quarter.\n\n2. Reason to buy: The stock isn't as expensive as investors might think\n\nOne gripe about Nvidia's stock has been how expensive it is. That's true if you look at the trailing-price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. At 76 times earnings, it could be considered outrageously expensive. But that doesn't do the stock justice. Nvidia is undergoing a massive transformation and is expected to post another massive quarter of growth (Wall Street projects 250% growth in Q1).\n\nAs a result, looking at trailing earnings does investors no good. Instead,they should utilize the forward P/E to value Nvidia. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 36 times forward earnings estimates, Nvidia is far from cheap. However, it's undergoing a massive shift, and this figure could be incredibly off the mark if Nvidia's growth continues. Furthermore, it's not far off from Microsoft, which trades at 35 times forward earnings despite growing much slower.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf valuation is a top reason to avoid Nvidia's stock, you may need to rethink that, as many other stocks trade in a similar range as Nvidia despite not having the growth.\n\n3. Reason to buy: New product launches could drive another demand wave\n\nAlthough Nvidia may have some of the best products on the market, it isn't resting on its laurels. Nvidia has launched a few new upgraded GPUs, like the Blackwell GPU. But what investors (and many companies) are waiting for is the H200.\n\nThis system is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2024 and is a massive upgrade over the already popular H100. Some companies may be holding out until the H200 is launched to future-proof their servers, as they don't want to upgrade in a couple of years when the H100s become obsolete.\n\nAlthough that's speculation, the H200 will undoubtedly drive new demand, especially from companies willing to pay top dollar to have the best products available.\n\nThese are great reasons to buy Nvidia's stock before its Q1 earnings date, but there's also a reason to sell.\n\nReason to sell: Anything short of perfection could ignite a sell-off\n\nWhile I mentioned that Nvidia's stock isn't as expensive as many think, it's still priced for perfection. If Nvidia misses the mark in any way this quarter, there will likely be a heavy sell-off.\n\nI think that's unlikely because the heavy demand for Nvidia's GPUs is still present. However, the company's execution is unknown until investors see the financials.\n\nShould Nvidia report a less-than-perfect quarter, investors must examine the situation more closely to determine whether the sell-off is warranted or a buying opportunity.\n\nAlthough the odds of this happening are pretty low, something as simple as a slip-up or a tone on a conference call can make or break a stock.\n\nWith how the industry currently looks, I see no problem with buying Nvidia's stock before Q1 results, as it's slated to be another quarter of incredibly strong growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Biotechnology is an interesting place to look if you’re looking for growth and are not put off by severe levels of volatility. Undoubtedly, there’s a bit of speculative zest regarding some of the smaller biotech stocks out there, many of whom depend on just a handful of pipeline candidates.\n\nAs pipeline hopefuls progress through clinical trials, there’s bound to be needle-moving news. When it comes to the most-watched drugs and treatments, a biotech stock can easily pop or plunge based on progress, setbacks, or anything in between.\n\nWhile the level of growth is more sizeable with small- and mid-cap biotech stocks, I’d much rather be a buyer of the behemoths. They tend to be on stabler footing, with large pipelines and the means to make money (something not all junior biotech companies can do in the early days).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough I’m not against diversifying into biotech exchange-traded funds (ETFs), I do think it’s more exciting to explore the potential behind industry heavyweights that have the talent and money to spend researching next-generation treatments for diseases plaguing the world. Here are three biotech giants on my radar right now:\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock has gone parabolic in recent quarters. With shares now up more than 550% in the past five years, questions linger as to what can help Lilly keep the recent share price momentum going strong.\n\nI’m not one for chasing stocks after they’ve doubled in just over a year’s time. That said, I do find Lilly has many drivers that could help it grow well after GLP-1 drugs lose their initial luster. There’s still plenty of demand for such obesity drugs, but as more rivals go on the market, Lilly needs to keep pulling remarkable innovations of its pipeline to retain and add to recent gains.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason to stick with Lilly for the long run lies in AI-fuelled innovation. It has the talent; now it’s poised to augment such talent with powerful AI models.\n\nLast year, the company struck a $250 million deal with XtalPi to work on AI—and robotics-assisted drug discovery. This exciting collaboration may offer a glimmer of what the future holds for Lilly and the top innovators in the biotech industry.\n\nIn many ways, I find the elevated multiple on LLY stock is warranted, given what the next 10 years could hold. Call it the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) of biotech, if you will.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the European biotech firm behind Ozempic, perhaps the weight-loss drug that started it all. Like shares of LLY, NVO stock has been red-hot in recent quarters. That is until it reported its first-quarter earnings, which, while solid, caused shares to dip before recovering ground in the following sessions. Now off 5.5% from its all-time high, the stock chart suggests now may be a good time to take some of that fat profit off the table.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 44.75 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), though, I still don’t consider Novo to be an absurdly expensive stock given its laser focus on “one-upping” itself. Even if whatever comes next cannibalizes Ozempic and Wegovy sales, I’d argue that, like GPUs (graphics processing units), Novo needs to keep investing in innovation to stay ahead of the pack, especially not that more than a handful of firms are targeting the massive obesity market.\n\nLast week, Novo shed light on a research project and collaboration with Metaphore Pharmaceuticals that seeks to put two more obesity products in its pipeline. That’s big news, and if all goes well, perhaps there will be no catching the biotech behemoth.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom red-hot momentum plays to a major biopharma laggard and potential deep-value play, we have Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), a firm that’s battling through quite a few headwinds of late. From Seagen acquisition uncertainties to a patent cliff to the fall of the COVID-19 business, it’s clear PFE stock will not be for everyone to catch on the way down.\n\nThe stock has shed more than 53% of its value from its peak levels. And though there are headwinds, there’s still hope for the firm as it seeks to outgrow pressures that could weigh down future quarters.\n\nDuring its latest round of earnings, Pfizer posted a good earnings result alongside a slight hike to its 2024 earnings guidance. It wasn’t a massive guidance hike, but nonetheless, given how battered PFE stock has been of late, it seemed like any bit of positives were to be given a thumbs up by investors.\n\nDismiss Pfizer as a value trap, if you will, but it has a great cancer franchise and a stacked, diversified pipeline that could help power a rebound at some point down the line.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Many investors look at Nvidia’s earnings to gauge how well the artificial intelligence industry is doing as a whole.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors had plenty to cheer about when Nvidia reported Q4 FY24 earnings. Revenue increased by 265% year-over-year while net income surged by 769% year-over-year. Nvidia’s guidance suggests that it will report $24.0 billion in Q1 FY25 revenue. That’s a big jump from the $7.19 billion in revenue from Q1 FY24.\n\nStrong demand for AI chips and technology suggests that Nvidia’s growth can continue. Data center revenue is Nvidia’s main segment, but it also benefits from other vibrant segments like gaming and professional visualization. Nvidia’s automotive segment is the only one that has been down year-over-year.\n\nNvidia stock has gained 87% year-to-date and is up by roughly 2,200% over the past five years.

Google has a search engine market share that exceeds 90%.\n\nAlphabet’s Gemini blunders painted the perception of the tech giant being behind in the AI race. While Microsoft has been creating more AI products, Alphabet’s Gemini era is starting to move along nicely. Alphabet’s revenue increased by 15% year-over-year in Q1 2024. Advertising and cloud computing were the key drivers.\n\nGoogle Cloud continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry. Alphabet’s cloud segment had a higher growth rate than Microsoft’s cloud division in the most recent quarter. It’s been that way for the past few quarters as more businesses turn to Google Cloud for storage, cybersecurity, and AI capabilities.\n\nThe stock is up by 22% year-to-date and has gained 193% over the past five years. Analysts believe the stock has more room to run and rated it as a “Strong Buy.”\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has established itself as a leading cybersecurity firm. Many businesses use the Falcon Platform, resulting in $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue. Investors have been rushing to accumulate shares as the stock is up by 30% year-to-date. Furthermore, it’s gained 400% over the past five years.\n\nArtificial intelligence has enhanced productivity and continues to create new possibilities. However, this technology is also available to unethical hackers who can now initiate more attacks. Crowdstrike has adjusted its platform in response to the rising threat of artificial intelligence.\n\nCybersecurity is increasingly becoming a battle of AI versus AI. Crowdstrike is investing heavily in artificial intelligence features that help businesses detect threats and respond to them sooner. Those initiatives have attracted more business. Revenue increased by 33% year-over-year in Q4 FY24 while GAAP net income came in positive at $53.7 million. It’s a welcome development for a firm that reported a $47.5 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a big data analytics company that offers innovative AI solutions for businesses and governments. The stock has been on a tear recently. It’s up by 24% year-to-date and has more than doubled over the past year. The stock trades at a lofty 172 P/E ratio but also has a 65-forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe forward P/E ratio is more palatable, but it’s still a lofty valuation. Some analysts are encouraging investors to buy the stock anyway. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) assigned a $28 price target which suggests a 36% upside. Wedbush has a more aggressive $35 price target that implies a 70% upside.\n\nPalantir reported 21% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024 and achieved GAAP profitability for the 6th consecutive quarter. Rising profits will help the valuation look more attractive for long-term investors. Commercial revenue increased by 27% year-over-year while government revenue was up by 16% year-over-year.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) produces the hardware that enables many cloud computing platforms. Many data centers use the company’s technology, and the computing power of AI has increased the demand for Arista’s solutions.\n\nThe company has been thriving long before the AI boom became mainstream in 2023. The stock is up by 36% year-to-date and has soared by 402% over the past five years. Investors got a bit jittery after concerns about Nvidia gobbling Arista Networks’ market share, but the firm put these concerns to rest with its recent earnings report.\n\nArista Networks reported 16.3% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024. GAAP net income came to $637.7 million compared to $436.5 million in GAAP net income during the same period last year. It marks a 46.1% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe tech firm has been winning higher price targets since its latest earnings report. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) believes the stock can reach $340 per share which suggests an 8%upside. KeyBanc (NYSE:KEY) is more optimistic and has set a $349 price target which implies an 11% upside.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a reasonably valued chipmaker that trades at a 24.5 P/E ratio. It also offers a 1.87% yield and has maintained a compounded annual dividend growth rate of 8.62% over the past decade. The company has hiked its dividend for 19 consecutive years. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years and is up by 30% year-to-date.\n\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon chip is the go-to choice for many smartphones. AI enhancements to the chip have resulted in pro-level photos and videos. As smartphone makers rush to incorporate artificial intelligence in their technology, they will need more advanced AI chips, and Qualcomm is ready to deliver.\n\nThe company endured a slow start in 2023 as other AI stocks rallied, but the company has caught its stride. Revenue increased by 1% year-over-year in Q2 FY24. That’s not much, but it’s better than the revenue declines from last year. Meanwhile, net income increased by 37% year-over-year to reach $2.3 billion for the quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, MSFT, GOOG, and ANET.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Piling Into 2 Rapidly Growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "With few exceptions over the last three decades, investors have always had a next-big-thing investment trend or innovation to look forward to. But since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, other next-big-thing trends have consistently come up short. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) aims to change that.\n\nIn its simplest form, AI relies on software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally oversee. What gives AI its undeniably lofty ceiling is the ability for these systems to learn and evolve without human intervention over time. Being able to infiltrate almost every sector and industry of the global economy can lead to trillions of dollars in added consumption-side benefits and productivity gains by the end of the decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the most direct beneficiary of the artificial intelligence revolution, it hasn't necessarily been a favorite of Wall Street's brightest and most-successful investors. Based on Form 13Fs filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that cover trades made during the fourth quarter, billionaire investors were sellers of Nvidia and chose to pile into two fast-growing AI stocks instead.\n\nMore than a half-dozen billionaires gave Nvidia the heave-ho\n\nBased solely on Nvidia's headline growth figures, investors would struggle to find any flaws with the company. Sales more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), with Data Center segment revenue skyrocketing by 217%.\n\nInitial demand for Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) has been otherworldly, which has resulted in exceptional pricing power for these chips. It's been estimated that Nvidia's GPUs, which are the preferred choice for running generative AI solutions and training large language models, control around a 90% share in high-compute data centers.\n\nHowever, this didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire asset managers from paring down their fund's respective stakes in Nvidia during the December-ended quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nFollowing an almost parabolic run higher by Nvidia's stock, these eight prominent billionaires may be counting on history rhyming, once more. Every next-big-thing investment trend or innovation since the mid-1990s has undergone a bubble-bursting event in its early stages of adoption. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technology. It's unlikely that AI breaks this streak, which would leave Nvidia's stock highly vulnerable to downside.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also hard to ignore the competitive pressures the company is liable to face in the coming months. Aside from direct external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia has to cope with the fact that most of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are developing in-house GPUs for their data centers. That's a problem when 40% of Nvidia's net sales come from four members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nRegulators have put a glass ceiling above Nvidia, as well. Despite its attempts to develop toned-down AI-GPUs for China, U.S. regulators have blocked exports of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs to the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product on two separate occasions.\n\nWhile billionaires were busy showing Nvidia to the door, they were piling into two other rapidly growing AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIntuitive Surgical\n\nThe first high-growth artificial intelligence stock that billionaires couldn't stop buying as they were sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is robotic-assisted surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG). During the fourth quarter, a half-dozen billionaires took the plunge, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (516,054 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (327,505 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (301,908 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (290,501 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (90,072 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (82,975 shares)\n\nIntuitive Surgical is best-known for its multiple generations of da Vinci surgical systems, which assist surgeons with a variety of soft tissue procedures. The company's systems are designed to reduce hospital recovery times and minimize the likelihood of post-procedure complications. The incorporation of AI and machine learning should improve patient care and lead to more informed decision-making.\n\nThis is a company that's undeniably enjoying first-mover competitive advantages. Through the end of March, it had nearly 8,900 of its da Vinci systems installed worldwide, which is far more robotic-assisted surgical systems than any of its competitors. Since these systems are pricey, and it takes quite a bit of time to train surgeons to use them, the company tends to keep its customers for a long time.\n\nAnother reason Intuitive Surgical has been such a phenomenal investment for so long is its razor-and-blades operating model. Although its da Vinci systems are pricey (often $0.5 million to $2.5 million), they're intricate and costly to build. Where the company generates its juiciest margins is from selling instruments with each procedure, as well as servicing these systems. These higher-margin categories have grown into a larger percentage of total sales over time, allowing earnings per share (EPS) to increase at a faster pace than its sales.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that the company's robotic-assisted surgical systems are still just scratching the surface with regard to their potential. While there are a few soft tissue indications where the da Vinci system dominates, there's a long runway to gain share in general soft tissue and thoracic procedures.\n\nPinterest\n\nThe second rapidly growing artificial intelligence stock billionaires have been piling into as they sell shares of semiconductor titan Nvidia is social media maven Pinterest(NYSE: PINS). Four top-tier billionaire money managers were buyers of Pinterest stock during the fourth quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (6,823,828 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (317,658 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (98,282 shares)\n\nPinterest has been leaning on AI and machine learning tools for years to improve the search functionality on its site and ensure that users are being shown content that's going to keep them engaged. In theory, further investment in AI should help Pinterest funnel users directly to merchants that carry well-liked/in-demand items.\n\nFor the March-ended quarter, Pinterest's stand-out number was its monthly active user (MAU) growth. While user growth isn't everything, it marked the first time Pinterest surpassed the half-billion MAU mark. This suggests the platform is resonating with a growing percentage of the global population.\n\nHaving 518 million MAUs has its perks on the advertising side, too. Merchants are realizing that Pinterest's MAUs tend to be motivated shoppers. More importantly, there aren't too many social media platforms that can reach 518 million sets of eyeballs. As Pinterest's social media clout grows, so does its ability to command stronger ad-pricing power.\n\nPinterest's straightforward operating model also provides a competitive advantage relative to most social media platforms. Whereas most social sites rely heavily on likes and data-tracking tools to help advertisers target users with their message(s), Pinterest's entire operating model hinges on its MAUs willingly and freely sharing the things, places, and services that interest them. Even if app developers continue to clamp down on data-tracking tools, this won't be much of a hinderance to Pinterest's platform.\n\nWith Pinterest's growth rate reaccelerating, it's easy to see why select billionaires can't get enough of this stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Nvidia Partners With Explosive Growth Potential to Buy Now",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) embodies artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiasm unlike any other growth stock. But what if you already own enough Nvidia, or are simply looking for other opportunities?\n\nA good place to start is by looking at the companies that Nvidia partners with that indirectly benefit from its success.\n\nThree that stick out are Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU), Vertiv Holdings(NYSE: VRT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). Here's what makes each stock a great buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicron is providing a key ingredient in Nvidia's new GPU\n\nScott Levine (Micron Technology): Of the many Nvidia partners that have the potential to prosper from a relationship with the AI juggernaut, Micron is a company that should certainly be on growth investors' radars.\n\nA leader in memory and storage solutions, Micron benefited from the AI industry's rapid growth in 2023. Its new partnership with Nvidia suggests that the company is extremely well positioned for future growth as the AI market continues to soar.\n\nIn February, Micron announced that it had commenced large-scale production of its high capacity memory solution, the High Bandwidth Memory 3E (HBM3E), and it began deliveries of the product in the second quarter. Micron asserts that the HBM3E will help enable \"lightning-fast data access for AI accelerators, supercomputers, and data centers.\" Nvidia will use the HBM3E in its graphics processing card (GPU), the H200 Tensor Core GPU. It's not only an increase in performance that makes the HBM3E attractive -- it's also appealing from an economics perspective. Micron lauds the HBM3E as a more cost-effective option, as it uses 30% less power than similar products.\n\nAccording to Nvidia, the H200 Tensor Core GPU doubles the memory capacity of its previous product, the H100 Tensor Core GPU, and has 1.4 times the bandwidth. With this upgrade in performance, Nvidia is confident that the H200 Tensor Core GPU will further facilitate the development of generative AI and large language models.\n\nThe relationship between Micron and Nvidia transcends the recently announced collaboration. In fiscal 2019, for example, Nvidia launched the GeForce RTX graphics card for the gaming market, which relied on Micron's memory chips.\n\nVertiv stock still has upside potential\n\nLee Samaha(Vertiv Holdings): The data center equipment provider's stock is on an incredible run. Up 549% over the last year and 103% in 2024 alone, investors must be wondering just how much longer the stock has to run, not least because it trades at 41 times estimated 2024 earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nYes, the valuation looks heady, but not if we are only in the very early innings of a multi-year investment cycle in data centers driven by AI-related investment. Vertiv's digital infrastructure technology (power management, thermal management, rack systems, etc.) is critical to the functioning of data centers, and it's a solution advisor or consultant partner in the Nvidia partner network.\n\nAs such, it's a vital beneficiary of the boom in spending on AI, and the company's recent first-quarter earnings demonstrated the strength of the momentum in the trend. Its orders growth was up 60% from the first quarter of 2023, and its book-to-bill ratio was 1.5 times, implying significant revenue growth to come as the company executes on its $6.3 billion backlog.\n\nWall Street has Vertiv's free cash flow growing at 22% and 25% in the years after 2024, and if AI spending trends continue, Vertiv should be able to grow into its valuation. If you are bullish on Nvidia, it makes sense to look at Vertiv, too.\n\nThe linchpin of chip manufacturing\n\nDaniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor):  Taiwan Semi is a bet on sustained demand for chips for consumer electronics, the automotive industry, AI accelerators, and more. In 2023, the chip-making company commanded 61% of global chip-foundry activity.\n\nNvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and others rely on Taiwan Semi to take their proprietary designs and manufacture to extremely precise specifications. Not to put down construction or engineering contractors, but what Taiwan Semi is doing is some of the most complicated manufacturing in the world. Taiwan Semi's ability to fulfill complex orders is why companies around the world outsource their chip manufacturing to Taiwan.\n\nInvestors may want to consider Taiwan Semi as a catch-all way to bet on the rising tides of AI, electrification, data centers, and the general need for more computing power. Taiwan Semi should benefit as long as overall demand is growing. It doesn't particularly care if AMD is taking market share from Nvidia or vice versa.\n\nDespite its advantages, Taiwan Semi does have some risks -- namely competition and the need to simplify supply chains and localize chip manufacturing to reduce geopolitical risk. The CHIPS Act in the U.S., for example, is keen on allocating billions to increase domestic chip production. Taiwan Semi has fabs in the U.S., but it is still primarily manufacturing chips in Asia.\n\nThe tailwinds of AI are strong, but that doesn't mean that growth in the semiconductor industry is a straight line up. Apple, for example, is undergoing a slowdown driven by weak iPhone demand. Taiwan Semi's sales and earnings have flatlined recently as some of its core markets fall under pressure. TSM Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nThe good news is that analysts expect earnings to recover, with consensus estimates calling for $6.26 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and 2025 consensus estimates of $7.86. As a result, Taiwan Semi's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 22.7 compared to its current P/E of 27.2.\n\nDespite being down just 10% from its all-time high, Taiwan Semi is a great value and a balanced buy for investors with the patience to endure the industry's cyclicality. It also sports a 1.4% dividend yield as a cherry on top of the strong underlying investment thesis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Long-term investing is one of the keys to sustainable returns in the stock market. This strategy overlooks near-term volatility, giving time for a company's fundamental qualities to shine through.\n\nWith shares up by almost 20,000% over the previous decade, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an excellent example of these principles. Let's see if the chipmaker has what it takes to continue beating the market over the next three years.\n\nThe best artificial intelligence (AI) stock\n\nIt's hard to imagine a better AI company than Nvidia, the top producer of the graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to train and run these complex algorithms. Business is booming, with fourth-quarter revenue up 265% to $22.1 billion, and profits up 769% to $12.3 billion.\n\nWhile rivals can sometimes replicate Nvidia's products in raw performance, it protects its position through CUDA, a programming platform and software solution optimized for Nvidia hardware.\n\nDespite these strong fundamentals, the stock trades for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 37. This valuation is moderately higher than the Nasdaq 100 average of 29 but much cheaper than comparable chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, which has a P/E of 43 despite growing revenue by only 2% to 5.47 billion in its most recent quarter. Make no mistake about it, Nvidia stock is cheap.\n\nWhy is the market putting a discount on Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's risks don't seem to have much to do with the company itself. The chipmaker has successfully created a moat around its GPUs and has a technological lead over rivals. And it is expanding its addressable market through software and a massive push into custom chips for clients.\n\nWithin the AI chip market, the company seems to have done everything right. That said, it has become alarmingly overexposed to this one industry.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the data center segment (which is dominated by AI GPU sales) generated $18.4 billion, or 83% of total revenue. And the company's gaming segment -- formerly its core -- now barely moves the needle with just $2.8 billion in sales. The worsening lack of diversification makes it uncomfortably vulnerable to changes in the consumer market for AI. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAs AI-related hype begins to fade over the next three years, companies will have to generate substantial earnings and cash flow to justify the billions they are spending on Nvidia's AI hardware.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, AI chatbots like ChatGPT lose money on every query because of the high cost of building and operating large language models (LLMs).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother challenge will come from open-source AI platforms like Elon Musk's Grok, which allows anyone to build projects on its source code for free -- potentially eroding the profit potential in the industry. All this could make it less financially appealing for Nvidia's clients to continue spending so much on its high-priced GPUs.\n\nHow will Nvidia perform over the next three years?\n\nWith its high growth rate and reasonable valuation, Nvidia can continue outperforming the market over the next three years. And over the very long term (think decades), the chipmaker's technological lead in GPU design could help it expand to more industries like automaking or virtual reality, which could fix its problem with a lack of diversification. That said, investors who buy the stock now face substantial near-term risks if the AI industry doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Nvidia (NVDA) closed at $903.99, marking a +0.58% move from the previous day. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.02%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.21%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.29%.\n\nShares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 1.92% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.39% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.29%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 22, 2024. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $5.49, reflecting a 403.67% increase from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $24.17 billion, showing a 236.08% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05 billion, signifying shifts of +84.72% and +74.07%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.44% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Nvidia is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.\n\nLooking at its valuation, Nvidia is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 37.55. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 23.39 of its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.21. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.51 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 189, this industry ranks in the bottom 25% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Pocket-Sized Powerhouses: 7 Small-Cap Value Stocks Ready to Roar",
        "content": "As the S&P 500 races toward new highs, some investors see small-cap value stocks as the best bet for long-term growth amid growing concerns about index-based stock concentration. As mega-caps like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) disproportionately drive the S&P 500’s performance, the index becomes more vulnerable to fluctuations—a few missteps could significantly impact your entire portfolio.\n\nIn contrast, small-cap value stocks offer distinct advantages. They are small and nimble enough to adapt to changing conditions and offer long-term growth potential. Their value-oriented nature helps preserve capital, often providing solid income and dividends alongside steady upward momentum.\n\nThese stocks combine these qualities, making them excellent options for diversifying risks away from the few dominant ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks that could otherwise dictate the fate of your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApartment Income REIT (AIRC) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nHigher interest rates usually suppress the new mortgage market and elevate rent levels in response to inflation, underscoring the robustness of small-cap value stock Apartment Income REIT (NYSE:AIRC) in a high-interest-rate environment.\n\nOver the past decade, Apartment Income has strategically honed its multifamily building portfolio, focusing on high-demand properties in urban areas with strong demographic growth. This approach secured consistently high occupancy rates and regular rent increases. Future demand for Apartment Income properties is likely to be driven by job and income growth, decreasing homeownership rates and the enduring appeal of urban living — all factors that intensify with rising interest rates.\n\nApartment Income REIT carefully refined its portfolio and operational strategy, reducing its property holdings from 300 in 2008 to 75 today while maintaining a strong presence in key markets. This strategic shift highlights savvy management choices prioritizing quality and operational efficiency in preferred locations over mere expansion. By moving away from lower-growth regions, AIRC has enhanced its growth potential and fortified its resilience against interest rate fluctuations.\n\nApartment Income offers a 4.6% forward yield and a robust option for diversification among small-cap value stocks, maintaining strength even amid economic uncertainties.\n\nCricut (CRCT) A photo of someone using a Cricut machine.\n\nSource: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com\n\nCrafty folk and DIY creatives love Cricut (NASDAQ:CRCT), but that doesn’t mean the small-cap value stock gets the love it should from investors. Though revenue slid slightly in its most recent earnings report, the company still offers investors a 1.83% trailing yield. It stands to gain from improving consumer sentiment, particularly as buyers seek stay-at-home activities to save money and maintain household budget management.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall sales dropped 8% in 2024 first quarter, though offset slightly by higher paid subscriber rates and higher machine sales — meaning more people began their Cricut journey over the past few months, and investors can expect a commensurate sales bump moving forward as new users restock and replenish crafting supplies.\n\nIf you’re interested in buying into Cricut, now is the time. Management announced a special one-time dividend of $0.40 in the earnings report. Shareholders of record as of July 2nd will get the sizable distribution on July 19th, so there’s still time to snag a piece of the action.\n\nMedifast (MED) Healthcare business graph data and growth, Medical examination and doctor analyzing medical report network connection on tablet screen. VANI stock\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedifast (NYSE:MED) hasn’t yet caught the wider weight loss wave affecting many pharma stocks. However, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a long-term opportunity for the nutrition and weight loss company to sell products across a range of platforms, including multi-level marketing.\n\nThe company’s first-quarter earnings report included a hefty $0.76 earnings per share. At the same time, its balance sheet boasts a respectable $150 million cash reserve with zero debt (important in today’s high-rate environment). Executives are also fighting to differentiate themselves from larger weight loss competitors.\n\nThey are angling for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to customer management, including guided habit development and bespoke coaching. To that end, management told investors to expect that “2024 will be a year of investment for future growth.” Though that may mean its 20% dividend yield won’t hold, it doesn’t detract from the company’s long-term upside potential.\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (YYAI) Various sports equipment like a football, soccer ball and volleyball on green grass.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (NASDAQ:YYAI) is one of those deep-value stocks that seem to be amid a resurgence despite trading at a bottom-barrel 0.05x sales. Connexa targets specific sports, such as the increasingly popular pickleball in the U.S., padel in Mexico and perennially favored tennis, with a range of unique sports equipment storage products.\n\nA targeted approach helps Connexa to engage directly with consumers through high-quality advertising campaigns, ensuring product longevity and market growth. These style strategies position Connexa as a promising small-cap value stock, particularly as enthusiasm for outdoor sports increases during the spring and summer months.\n\nIn 2023, Connexa warred with short sellers, who drove its share price down by over 70%, leading to a reverse stock split. However, the tides shifted for the small-cap value stock after new strategic investors came on board, boosting the stock’s value by over 260% since January. This remarkable turnaround signals strong momentum for Connexa’s future, especially as the summer sports season approaches and more consumers gear up for outdoor activities.\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX)\n\nSource: Nvidia\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) brings major benefits to the small-cap value stock table: it trades at just 7x earnings and 0.5x sales while remaining an overlooked player within the green tech and sustainable driving sector. The company manufactures a range of automotive parts that enhance emission reductions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nThough “pure” EV companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are currently losing favor due to declining consumer interest, as shown by the surge in hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales, Garrett Motion serves as a bridge for investors seeking long-term sustainability but recognizing that global EV adoption remains a long-term goal.\n\nThe recent dip in Garrett Motion’s stock followed an earnings report that showed a 6% drop in quarterly sales; however, its annual sales were stable, and the company maintained healthy margins and free cash flow. This stock is underappreciated and undervalued as investors chase more conspicuous growth opportunities. Still, as automakers revise their EV planning timelines, expect Garret Motion to become a major small-cap value stock in tomorrow’s market.\n\nCostamare (CMRE) Costamare Inc. website zoomed in on the logo\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven as challenges in seafaring shipping put competitor transport stocks at risk, containership chartering company Costamare (NYSE:CMRE) remains a robust and accurate small-cap value stock, trading at just 0.6x book value and 6x earnings. Unfortunately, you’ll need a little patience if you plan to wait for the company to return to past strength. Although global freight and charter prices spiked in early 2024, Costamare’s status as a non-operating owner means its fleet is more than 87% booked for the remainder of the year, often at less-than-ideal pricing.\n\nStill, Costamare’s management is adeptly adjusting operations, divesting smaller ships while acquiring larger vessels to enhance cost efficiency amid increasingly unpredictable naval transport due to geopolitical tensions.\n\nHonestly, Costamare is an attractive buy at these levels, but investors should brace for a gradual build in upward momentum before the stock truly sets sail. In the meantime, Costamare’s healthy 6% total yield — split between buybacks and distributions — should satisfy shareholders in the short term.\n\nSteelcase (SCS) An image of a smartphone displaying the text \"Steelcase\" in black font on a white screen, with a computer screen showing stock charts and a windows taskbar in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nHigh-end home office and corporate furniture manufacturer Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) is an under-the-radar small-cap stock that offers stability and upside potential as the company adapts to changing conditions. The company has adeptly navigated the shift towards work-from-home trends post-pandemic and is poised to continue innovating in the face of economic challenges.\n\nSteelcase rapidly regained financial stability following pandemic-related challenges. Its latest quarterly earnings report revealed a net income of $30.8 million, more than double the previous year’s. Furthermore, the company has maintained steady sales of around $800 million over the past five quarters, showcasing its ability to enhance margins without sacrificing quality.\n\nIn response to the continued shift toward remote work, Steelcase aims for 5-7% annual sales growth and a 5% free cash flow margin as a percentage of revenue over the next five years. Additionally, the company has significantly cut its debt to better cope with the higher interest rate environment, thereby boosting liquidity and reducing interest costs. These strategic efforts position Steelcase as a top small-cap value stock today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best ARK stocks to buy now. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best ARK Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nCathie Wood is one of the most polarizing, and prominent figures on Wall Street. With over three decades of experience in the financial sector, including a notable tenure as the chief investment officer of the global thematic strategies division at AllianceBernstein Holding LP, she founded ARK Investment Management a decade ago. Currently serving as the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ARK, she manages nearly $17 billion in assets under management across the ARK Invest family of exchange-traded funds and her distinctive venture capital fund, the ARK Venture Fund.  Although her funds have drawn notice for their innovative strategies, they've also encountered varied outcomes, often likened to rollercoaster rides, with ARK Investment Management witnessing one of its most triumphant years in 2017, achieving a notable 87.4% gain driven by a remarkable 1,300% surge in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. This success coincided with Bitcoin reaching unprecedented highs of $20,000 per coin.\n\nOn the other hand, Wood's premier investment vehicle, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), experienced a surge of 211% in both March 2020 and January 2021 and managed to retain much of this momentum as the tech sector flourished amidst increased demand for computing products during the latter stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, 2022 presented challenges, characterized by rampant inflation and turmoil on Wall Street from elevated interest rates, leading to the Ark Innovation ETF plummeting by 47% over the year, wiping out all gains accrued during the pandemic era. As of May 10, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) has declined approximately 14.6% year-to-date, contrasting with the S&P 500's 10% gain during the same period.\n\nAdditionally, Wood has made several predictions about Bitcoin, consistently raising the price target over time. At the beginning of the year, she mentioned that Ark's \"base case\" for Bitcoin would be $600,000. However, this forecast has since been revised upwards to as high as $3.8 million by the year 2030:\n\n\"Last year we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, many are critical of this position. One such individual being Kevin O'Leary. Earlier in January, the \"Shark Tank\" host stated that if Bitcoin were to appreciate to the levels predicted by Cathie Wood, it would signify a collapse of the American economy. While O'Leary acknowledges that many see Bitcoin as a hedge against economic downturns, and he himself holds a portion of it for that reason, with his confidence stemming from Bitcoin's predictable supply, O'Leary doesn't foresee an imminent collapse of the global or U.S. economy, which would be necessary for Bitcoin to meet Wood's ambitious price target.\n\nThis wasn't the only controversial opinion that the ARK Invest CIO holds. Those keeping up with Cathie Wood over the years might be familiar with her consistently emphasizing innovation, growth, and technological disruption poised to revolutionize human societies. Over recent years, she has heavily invested in genetics, 3D printing, biotechnology, self-driving, and electric cars. However, when it comes to AI, she  appears more cautious, as she alerts investors about valuations in this sector. For the past couple of quarters, Wood has been steadily selling off shares of chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a company many would consider nothing less than the superstar amidst the AI revolution. In an episode of the Wall Street Journal's Take on the Week, Wood gave an idea behind her decisions:\n\nWe have been selling Nvidia for quite some time, mostly because we believe that for every dollar of AI hardware sold, another $10 of AI software will be sold. Everyone now understands that Nvidia is the key chip player. It's created the AI age in a sense, but we do think that it has become a check the box stock. It's surprising hugely on the high side of expectations, and we do think that expectations could be getting ahead of themselves. Now, I've said this for the past $200, it's closing in on $700 now, but I've watched Nvidia all my career actually since it's gone public, it's a very cyclical stock. The reason is just like now, when Nvidia is feeding a new movement, in 2017, it was the crypto movement, GPUs were very important. There's this hyperactivity, everyone excited trying to get in at the same time, so there's double ordering, triple ordering, quadruple ordering, and then there is an inventory correction. We think that will happen again. Whenever I hear double ordering, triple ordering, quadruple ordering in response to shortages, I do pull away from a stock like that.\n\nThe first quarter of the year didn't bring much in terms of good news for the Wall Street investor, as Shares in Cathie Wood’s flagship fund tumbled to a five-month low on April 16 following a drop in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), its largest holding, prompted by concerns over the carmaker’s growth prospects amid a round of job cuts. This decline marks a continuation of the challenging period for the $6.7 billion ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), which has faced losses this year as a number of unprofitable tech companies lose favor with investors and expectations for interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve diminish.\n\nOn the other hand, Cathie Wood's ARK Invest recently offloaded $15 billion worth of 70,600 Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) shares, prompting speculation from investors. Wood clarified that this move wasn't about dumping stock but rather active portfolio management and emphasized that despite the sale, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) remains a top position in ARK Invest's holdings, reflecting confidence in the company's long-term potential. Wood also mentioned plans to reinvest profits into other promising stocks, highlighting a dynamic investment strategy aimed at maximizing returns.\n\nRegardless of her position in current trends, investors pay attention to her movements within the market. With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the best stocks in Cathie Wood's ARK portfolio. Some notable names in this list include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH), and Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), among others. 15 Best ARK Stocks To Buy Now\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Investment Management\n\n15. Beam Therapeutics Inc.

Founded in 2006, Shopify now holds a commanding >10% market share in US e-commerce.\n\nThe value of Shopify lies in its simplicity for merchants to easily start and scale their business, so much so that merchants fall in love with their solutions and never want to leave, no matter how big they get. They understand that as they grow and confront new challenges, Shopify will solve their problems so they can take their business to the next level. That is the power of Shopify’s flywheel.\n\nWe have owned Shopify’s stock since 2022. Our average cost basis is $60. Following our purchase, the stock hit a low of $26 in October 2022. Just 15 months following those lows, Shopify stock is now trading at $80 (a 200% rebound) as investors celebrated the decision to sell its capital intensive logistics business, which was largely expected to cost billions of dollars to build out — a move that enables Shopify to retain its original, asset-light business model. Additionally, while many tech companies struggled in the face of macroeconomic challenges, Shopify defied expectations by maintaining robust revenue growth in 2023. Revenue increased by 25% year-over-year in the most recent quarter, with gross profit growing by a healthy 36%. We are now sitting on a +35% unrealized gain on our position after owning the stock for almost 2 years. Not a bad return, but what a wild ride it has been.

        "title": "AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations",
        "content": "AMD Failed To Meet Lofty Expectations\n\nAt the end of April, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) failed to impress, unlike Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) that has been crushing investor expectations on the back of soaring AI chip sales for quite a while. It’s no secret that AMD trails the undoubtable leader Nvidia that holds as much as 80% of the thriving market for AI server semiconductors.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the March quarter, AMD reported revenue rose 2% YoY to $5.47 billion that slightly surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $5.46 billion.\n\nUnlike last year’s comparable quarter when it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share, AMD reported a net income of $123 million, or 7 cents per share.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to 62 cents per share, slightly surpassing 61 cents a share analysts expected.\n\nData center revenue jumped 80% to $2.3 billion thanks to AMD's MI300 series of AI processors that challenge Nvidia and its graphics processing units. CEO Lisa Su revealed that AMD’s MI300X is being used by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). Since the launch which took place during 2023’s fourth quarter, AMD sold over $1 billion worth of chips.\n\nBut it was not enough to offset weakness in the traditional server market. Moreover, AMD’s results were also hurt by gaming revenue that tanked as much as 48% to $922 million.\n\nAMD already guided significant double-digit percentage declines in this segment due to revenue from the chips it designs for gaming consoles such as Xbox from Microsoft Corporation and PlayStation 5 from Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) already hitting their peak. This year marks the fifth year since the most recent generation of gaming consoles has been released and AMD's videogame console revenue peaks after roughly four years.Moreover, a report from research firm Newzoo that was published in April revealed that gamers are clocking in less hours. Newzoo expects personal computing and console gaming revenue growth to continue lagging pre-pandemic levels through 2026. Year to date, industry giants like Sony and Electronic Arts have laid off hundreds of employees. Sony Group is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. All eyes will be on the profitability of the gaming division as PlayStation 5 promotions ate into profits during the third quarter. When it reported its third fiscal quarter results, Sony lowered projections of PlayStation 5 sales and gaming revenue for the rest of the fiscal 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue from the embedded segment that consists of networking chips also plummeted 46% to $846 million, with demand for the segment already expected to remain soft throughout the first half of the year. Revenue was additionally hit from ongoing inventory corrections from this segment as clients clear out a build-up of chips.\n\nA Guidance That Failed To Impress\n\nFor the full year, AMD expects AI chip sales of about $4 billion, raising its prior estimate by $500 million. As for the second quarter, AMD guided revenue of about $5.70 billion, plus or minus $300 million which is in line with LSEG’s average estimate.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, AMD guided for second quarter’s gross margin of about 53%, hardly beating the estimate of 52.9%.\n\nIn simple words, investors were expecting a stronger demand pipeline for AMD’s AI-related products and were disappointed were AMD being slower than Nvidia.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Nvidia Was Key to Success in My Stock-Picking Derby",
        "content": "You had to pick Nvidia.\n\nTo do well in my latest annual stock-picking contest, Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, it helped immensely if Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of your selections. Six people chose it as one of their three picks, and each of them finished among the top 10 contestants.\n\nHarriet Ruben, a retired real estate broker from Fairlawn, Ohio, won the latest contest with an 88.7% return. She scored a 144% gain in Nvidia, 96% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and 26% in Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). All figures are total returns including dividends.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nThese are popular, large-capitalization growth stocks, which are the type of stocks that Ruben favors in her actual investing. She says she has a large portfolio, which includes each of her three contest entries, plus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and quite a few other stocks.\n\nRuben says she listens to corporate chief executives who are interviewed on television, then follows up with statistical research on her broker's web site. I look for the next best thing,' she says.\n\nBeaten down\n\nUsing quite a different approach, Ted Dempsey of Virginia Beach, Virginia, grabbed second place in the Derby. He is 87 years old, a retired Navy officer and consultant. No longer an active investor, he liked to speculate on stocks that are beaten down in price.\n\nFor his contest entries last May, he chose Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) and PacWest Bancorp, which was acquired by Banc of California Inc. (NYSE:BANC). His average return on the three was 76%.\n\nDempsey says he was able to retire mostly because of a big gain on his investment in Labor Ready Inc., now known as TrueBlue Inc. (NYSE:TBI), an industrial staffing company. I happened to know the two founders of Labor Ready, he says. I was probably excessive in buying it but I got very lucky.\n\nBitcoin surge\n\nRobert B.K. Krout of Virginia Beach finished third with a 75.8% return. His return came on the strength of a 298% surge in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:EBTC); his other two picks declined.\n\nKrout is a retired mechanical engineer and a volunteer with the Sierra Club Offshore Wind Group. He believes bitcoin prices tend to follow a pattern: a low period for a year or so before demand and price rise again.\n\nIronically, crypto currencies play only a small role in Krout's real-life investing. He owns some bitcoin and some ethereum, but regards them as speculative and limits his crypto exposure to about 2% of his total portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nHis other two contest picks for 2023-24 were Albemarle corp. (NYSE:ALB) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). He continues to like them, and also likes a number of big technology names.\n\nWide spread\n\nThis year there was a huge dispersion of contestants' results. Of the 34 people who entered, nine had returns of 50% or better, while 11 had losses. The worst loss was 39%.\n\nThe median return for contestants was 20%. That was close to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index, which was 20.2%.\n\nYou can play\n\nYou are welcome to enter the next edition of Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, which will be the 17th such contest I have hosted. To enter, please email or mail me the following items:\n\nYour name Your Address Your Occupation Your Email address You home and work phone numbers. The names and stock symbols of the three stocks you choose. You don't have to give your reasoning, but I appreciate it if you do.\n\nEmail me your entry at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com. Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110.\n\nEntries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 31, 2024. The contest period will be from the market close on that date through the close on April 30, 2025.\n\nIf you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are vital.\n\nYou do not need to own the stocks you select, but it is fine if you do. Stocks must be traded in the U.S., but need not necessarily be U.S. companies. Short sales are permitted but not encouraged, since I have a separate short-selling contest. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are permitted.\n\nThere is no fee to enter. The winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of her or his choice.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts, and a syndicated columnist.

        "content": "Baidu, Inc. BIDU is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 16.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.31 billion, indicating a decline of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.30 per share, suggesting a 1.7% fall from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The estimated figure has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nBIDU’s earnings beat estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average being 17.14%.\n\nBaidu, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Baidu, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nBaidu, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Baidu, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nBaidu’s first-quarter 2024 results are likely to have benefited from its strengthening AI business, driven by the growing momentum of ERNIE Bot across China.\r\n\r\nStrength across Baidu Cloud is likely to have been another key catalyst for its AI business.\r\n\r\nThe company’s increasing focus on bolstering its ad technologies by introducing AI chatbots for brands, enabling them to enhance user engagement and drive customer demand, is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nBaidu’s expanding partnerships with companies like Samsung, Honor and Autohome, which integrates ERNIE API into their own products, are expected to have further solidified its position as a leader in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nStrength in Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China, on the back of its ongoing efforts to expand its operating area and intensify operations during peak hours in areas with complex traffic conditions, is likely to have aided Baidu’s intelligent driving business during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in Baidu's mobile ecosystem is expected to have aided growth in the average daily active user base of the Baidu App in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company’s growing R&D efforts to enable enterprises and developers to use less advanced chips for efficient model training and inferencing are likely to have provided Baidu with a competitive advantage over its domestic peers in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, the impacts of higher channel spending, promotional expenses and heavy spending on new growth areas are expected to have affected the company’s performance in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nFurther, broad-based weakness in China is anticipated to have negatively impacted the company during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nThe intensifying competitive landscape in generative AI and large language model markets is likely to have been a headwind.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nBaidu has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in their upcoming releases:\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA has an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA’s earnings is pegged at $5.49 per share, suggesting a significant jump from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of $1.09 per share.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie & Fitch ANF has an Earnings ESP of +5.10% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\r\n\r\nAbercrombie & Fitch is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 29.

This computing-for-equity approach is precious in China, where cloud resources are scarce due to U.S. export restrictions on advanced chips.\n\nAlibaba’s commitment to AI extends to monetizing its inventory of AI chips, which includes significant orders of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs stored in data centers across China and Southeast Asia. Earlier Alibaba chief Joe Tsai had flagged how China lagged behind in AI race due to US tech embargo.\n\nLast week, Alibaba launched the latest version of its large language model, Qwen2.5, which it claimed to beat OpenAI’s GPT-4 in language skills.\n\nAlibaba stock lost over 9% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Option Traders Bet on Inflation Data, Nvidia for Next Big Swings",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders are eyeing this week’s US inflation data for a potential break in the calm that’s come over the market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy Putin Names Economist as Defense Minister in Surprise Reshuffle Global Chips Battle Intensifies With $81 Billion Subsidy Surge\n\nThe options market is betting that the S&P 500 Index will move 0.9% in either direction after Wednesday’s report on consumer prices, based on the price of that day’s at-the-money straddles, according to Citigroup Inc. The report will be closely watched by traders for signals as to how much the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates this year.\n\nA big swing around the CPI report comes as volatility across markets has been tamped down. The VIX Index measuring S&P volatility is near the year’s low, while volatility on VIX options — used to hedge against a big market selloff — is the lowest in nine years. At the same time, since the Fed decision on May 1, bets in the Treasury market have been tilting toward more aggressive rate cuts.\n\nThe broader market is bracing for a big move around CPI that’s in line with expectations on May 23 — the day after Nvidia Corp. delivers its latest earnings results. Those implied moves are larger swings than what’s expected following the government’s next jobs report, due on June 7, even after employers scaled back hiring in April, suggesting cooling in the labor market after a strong start to the year.\n\n“Inflation has been the bigger event for traders the past two years and still is,” Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup Inc.’s head of US equity trading strategy said over the phone. “Despite a recent payrolls miss, any prints that show more than 150,000 jobs were created in a given month, investors will largely be comfortable with that because it still reflects a strong labor market. If job growth were to come in below that, the market will start to shift its focus toward hiring growth over inflation.”\n\nOverall, the slide in volatility and lower premiums for puts has made broader stock market hedging more attractive, and some VIX call spread buying was seen last week.\n\n“The rise in interest rates that has pushed up SPX forwards increases call premiums relative to puts,” Tanvir Sandhu, Chief Global Derivatives Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “This has eased the entry for collar strategies that sell calls and buy puts. The decline in the SPX skew, which is close to the low of the last 10-year range, has also reduced the cost of this strategy.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTreasury market positioning leading into the inflation report appears to have been somewhat neutralized, given covering of shorts and initiation of new long positions seen since the Fed’s policy announcement and the April jobs report.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the central bank decision, notable short covering of SOFR futures was seen as Fed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to remove the tail-risk of a hike being the next policy move. Longs then started to build. Recent options have suggested that tail-risk hedging has shifted to a more aggressive path of rate cuts, with some positioning in SOFR options even centered around the potential for a rate cut as early as July.\n\nOne large risk-reversal trade late last week in options expiring May 24 targeted a drop in the 10-year Treasury note’s yield to 4.25%, while risking losses of up to $15 million an increase to around 4.7%.\n\nRead more: High-Risk Options Bet on Bond Rally at Risk of Losing Millions\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCorporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "Amazingly, there are still bearish holdouts who, despite all of the available evidence, continue to bet against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The opportunity to generate revenue from artificial intelligence compatible processors isn’t just a fad. Nvidia stock gets an “A” grade for advancing AI hardware technology in 2024.\n\nNvidia has an earnings report and conference call coming up on May 22. This will be an exciting event, but you don’t have to wait until May 22 to start a share position in Nvidia. After all, you can pick any day in May to invest in an overachiever like Nvidia.\n\nThis Is a Positive Sign for Nvidia\n\nHow strong is the demand for AI-enabled hardware? Here’s a news item that should help to answer this question. According to Reuters, South Korea-based SK Hynix disclosed that its “high-bandwidth memory chips used in AI chipsets were sold out for this year and almost sold out for 2025.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is relevant because SK Hynix is a supplier to Nvidia. Furthermore, these HBM chips are selling like hot cakes “as businesses aggressively expand artificial intelligence services.”\n\nReuters also mentioned that Nvidia commands around 80% of the AI-chip market. That’s astonishing, if you really think about it. And clearly, it’s a great market for Nvidia to be involved with.\n\nWhen a major supplier like SK Hynix has products that are flying off the shelves (figuratively speaking), it’s hard not to be long-term bullish about Nvidia stock.\n\nPreparing for a ‘New Era’ With Nvidia\n\nNvidia’s AI conference for developers, known as GTC, took place recently and Nvidia didn’t disappoint eager tech-product aficionados. At the GTC event, Nvidia unveiled its cutting-edge Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture.\n\nThe company expects Blackwell to “power a new era of computing.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that Blackwell is the “engine to power” the “new industrial revolution” of generative AI.\n\nThis isn’t empty boasting. Per TheStreet, Nvidia stated that Blackwell will “enable organizations to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models.”\n\nPlus, the company claims that Blackwell will achieve this “at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.”\n\nWith the new Blackwell architecture coming down the pipeline, Nvidia’s already ultrapowerful H100 chips could soon be yesterday’s news. It’s another example of Nvidia topping itself, since evidently no competitor can top Nvidia.\n\nBe an Overachiever Investor With Nvidia Stock\n\nIf you can be any type of investor, why not be an overachiever investor? It’s entirely possible if you stick to overachieving companies like Nvidia. As we’ve seen, the demand for AI-compatible processors is intense — and Nvidia is stepping up to the plate with top-tier products.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackwell will be Nvidia’s latest game changer in the AI-hardware category. After that, we’ll all just have to wait and see what amazing products Nvidia unveils next.\n\nSo, there’s no wait for Nvidia’s upcoming earnings event to get involved. Investors should conduct their due diligence and take action when they’re ready to do so, and Nvidia stock absolutely deserves a confident “A” grade .\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "3 Ultra-Popular Stocks Billionaire Investors Are Selling",
        "content": "Investors are never lacking for data on Wall Street. We're currently in the heart of earnings season, and economic data continues to be reported on a near-daily basis. But arguably the most important data release of the quarter is set to occur this Wednesday, May 15. This marks the deadline for institutional money managers to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds, with at least $100 million in assets under management, have been buying, selling, and holding in the most recent quarter -- in this instance, the March-ended quarter. It's not uncommon for professional and everyday investors to follow in the footsteps of Wall Street's most-successful asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut you don't have to wait until this coming Wednesday to get a sneak peak at what some of Wall Street's most-prominent asset managers have been up to. Thanks to interviews, annual meetings, and earnings releases, select billionaire investors have revealed selling activity in three ultra-popular stocks during the first quarter.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller sells shares of Nvidia\n\nThe first widely owned stock that was given at least a partial heave-ho during the March-ended quarter is semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In a recent interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, Druckenmiller admitted that his fund, Duquesne Family Office, cut its position in Nvidia in \"late March.\" For context, Duquesne Family Office held 617,494 shares of Nvidia, along with 489,500 Nvidia call options, as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nAlthough Druckenmiller believes the value of artificial intelligence (AI) for corporate America may be undervalued looking five years into the future, he admits that near-term hype may have gotten ahead of itself for AI stocks, including Nvidia.\n\nFor the moment, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed top choice by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. In particular, the H100 is powering generative AI solutions and helping to train large language models.\n\nHowever, the coming 12 months could prove especially challenging for the backbone of the AI revolution.\n\nFor starters, competition is coming at Nvidia from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have AI-accelerators designed to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia's H100 in enterprise data centers.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's top four customers (roughly 40% of net sales), which are members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are complementary to Nvidia's H100 GPUs, it seems highly likely that the Magnificent Seven will be far less reliant on Nvidia's AI infrastructure beyond 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, AI-GPU scarcity was the driving force behind Nvidia's 217% sales growth from its Data Center segment. But as AMD, Intel, and other Magnificent Seven companies deploy their own chips, Nvidia could struggle to maintain its otherworldly pricing power on its GPUs.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that every next-big-thing investment trend for three decades has endured a bubble in its early innings of expansion. It's incredibly likely that investors will, once again, overestimate the adoption of a new technology. If history repeats itself and the AI bubble bursts, no company will be hit harder than Nvidia. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWarren Buffett dumps Paramount Global\n\nAnother billionaire investor that let the cat out of the bag before releasing a required 13F is Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. During his company's annual shareholder meeting on May 4, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" confessed that all shares of media behemoth Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA) -- 63,322,491 shares, as of Dec. 31, 2023 -- were sold at a loss during the first quarter.\n\nBuffett typically approaches his investments outside of the financial sector with a focus on consumer habits. His thesis was likely that a rebound in advertising for Paramount's TV network segment, coupled with a lengthy history of consumers gobbling up traditional and streamed content, would allow Paramount to regain its luster. Unfortunately, this failed to come to fruition.\n\nLike most legacy media companies, Paramount has struggled to make its direct-to-consumer segment profitable. The costs associated with building its content library and marketing its streaming network have weighed on its bottom line.\n\nBut if there's a silver lining here, it's that global DTC subscriber count and average revenue per user are climbing, which suggests that Paramount has been successful in raising subscription prices without scaring away its members. The company noted that year-over-year operating losses before depreciation and amortization have shrunk in each of the last four quarters for its DTC segment.\n\nThe advertising environment has been challenging, as well. Last year, a couple of predictive indicators, such as the first sizable decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression, signaled a high probability of the U.S. falling into a recession. Advertisers often front-run economic weakness by reducing their spending. Weaker ad revenue has undeniably hurt Paramount's legacy TV network.\n\nThere's also been concern about Paramount's ability to service its $14.6 billion in long-term debt ($12.2 billion in net debt). Unless the company can substantially lessen its streaming losses, it's going to be difficult to silence critics.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" also pared back Berkshire's stake in Apple\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's selling didn't end with Paramount Global. Although we have to wait a few more days to get the complete story, Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter operating results show that a sizable chunk -- about 115 million shares -- of the company's stake in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was given the heave-ho.\n\nIn addition to Berkshire's operating results spilling the beans, Buffett freely admitted during his company's annual shareholder meeting that he and his investment team pared down this mammoth stake in the March-ended quarter. He justified this reduction by pointing to corporate tax rates. Buffett opined that investors would come to appreciate Berkshire locking in gains at a 21% peak corporate tax rate given the likelihood that corporate tax rates rise in the future.\n\nDespite jettisoning around 13% of his company's stake in Apple, Warren Buffett still views the company as Berkshire's best business.\n\nApple has an exceptionally loyal base of customers, and it's frequently led with innovation. CEO Tim Cook has successfully overseen the development of domestic market share-leading iPhones, as well as Apple's transformation to a platform's company.\n\nBut if you asked Warren Buffett what his favorite thing is about Apple, it might very well be the company's unsurpassed capital-return program. Apple is on track to dole out a little over $15.4 billion in dividends to its shareholders this year, and has repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Buffett loves buybacks because they can incrementally increase the ownership stakes of long-term investors.\n\nHowever, Apple isn't immune to headwinds. Following a modest sales decline in fiscal 2023 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September), the second-largest public company by market cap has seen its net sales slip by less than 1% through the first half of the current fiscal year. While subscription services revenue has been strong, physical product sales remain weak.\n\nFurthermore, while modest cost-cutting and an aggressive share repurchase program have kept earnings per share (EPS) moving in the right direction, a deeper dive into Apple's net income shows the company's growth engine has stalled.\n\nApple was a bargain when it was delivering sustained double-digit sales growth and trading at a multiple of 10 to 15 times forward-year EPS. But at 27 times forward-year EPS and with sales going nowhere, this Wall Street darling looks to be losing its sheen.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will no doubt have very strong growth over the next year-plus. But while the chip designers like Nvidia and its would-be competitors garner a lot of headlines, the less sexy advanced packaging process is actually today's big AI bottleneck.\n\nThat's why these two under-the-radar advanced packaging tech stocks are primed to take off in 2025. Advanced packaging companies will see revenue explode from AI demand. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's advanced packaging, and why's it so important?\n\nPackaging is the concept of connecting chips from different wafers together to create a unified computing system. While traditional electronics packaging has been used to good-enough effect for legacy applications like PCs, smartphones, and industrial chip systems, today's AI systems require GPUs, CPUs, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), I/O controllers, and other elements to relay information at lighting-fast speed and as energy-efficiently as possible. Meanwhile, virtually all major chipmakers are beginning to use \"chiplets,\" in which the processor itself is constructed of different components produced on different wafers, then closely stitched together.\n\nThat requires new advanced packaging technologies, which first emerged around the year 2000, according to McKinsey. But hypergrowth for these newer technologies is now beginning.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's foundry and leader in AI chipmaking, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, has a shortage of advanced packaging capacity. TSMC will triple its chip-on-wafer-on substrate advanced packaging capacity this year to 45,000 to 50,000 wafers per month, yet TSMC has said that packaging capacity is already fully booked for the next two years. And with \"AI PC\" production kicking in this year, even Intel has recently found itself short on advanced packaging capacity for AI PC systems on a chip, according to Trendforce.\n\nOnto Innovation\n\nOne way to play the advanced packaging trend is Onto Innovation(NYSE: ONTO). To be sure, investors have already somewhat caught on to the Onto story, with the stock up over 150% over the past year. But its growth runway should last through this decade\n\nOnto makes equipment that serves several chipmaking processes crucial for AI. But its highest-growth segment is its Dragonfly wafer inspection tools for advanced packaging. These systems help detect imperfections in chip packages, especially microcracks in ultrathin wafers currently being used in highly dense AI and chiplet packages.\n\nIn Onto's just-reported first-quarter earnings, management noted that Dragonfly system revenue grew 30% just over the prior quarter. Meanwhile, the whole Advanced Packaging segment, which comprises its Dragonfly and Firefly inspection systems as well as the JetStep packaging lithography equipment, grew 64% over the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile overall revenue grew \"only\" 14.9% last quarter, the Advanced Packaging and Specialty segment made up $161 million out of Onto's $229 million total revenue, or 70%. So if advanced packaging continues its strong growth, Onto's growth could accelerate.\n\nNot only that, but Onto should also see a big lift from its other segments in metrology inspection equipment for advanced logic and memory nodes. Those segments have been through a big downturn over the past two years, but they should recover strongly. This is especially true for Onto as gate-all-around (GAA) transistor technology emerges next year for advanced chip nodes. Onto's Atlas and Iris systems are likely to take significant share in metrology amid the GAA transition.\n\nAs advanced packaging inspection continues its rapid growth and GAA technology emerges, look for Onto's financials to reaccelerate in 2025.\n\nKulicke & Soffa\n\nUnlike Onto, Kulicke & Soffa(NASDAQ: KLIC) hasn't seen its stock surge over the past year, with its stock just about flat over the past 52 weeks.\n\nThat's probably because KILC's business is still dominated by the traditional ball bonder legacy packaging business, which has seen a severe downcycle since mid-2022. While that segment is starting to recover, Kulicke & Soffa also serves the electric-vehicle (EV) battery packaging industry, and that segment has recently taken a hit as the EV market has decelerated. KLIC also serves the advanced display market, and it just saw a large next-gen project around microLEDs cancelled by a big customer, pushing that technology transition to later this decade.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Kulicke & Soffa also has an emerging segment in advanced packaging, thermocompression bonding (TCB) technology, and advanced wafer-level packaging. TCB is just beginning to take off in a big way. On the recent conference call, management noted it had taken share from competitors at the world's leading outsourced assembly and test (OSAT) and has engagements with 10 of the world's leading foundries, OSATs, and integrated device manufacturers for TCB.\n\nKLIC's 2023 TCB revenue was just $60 million, but four times the amount in 2021. But TCB and newer wafer-level packaging processes techniques are on track to deliver a combined $200 million in revenue by fiscal 2025. For context, Kulicke had $736 million in trailing-12-month revenue. So in 2025, these high-growth advanced technologies will make up a more significant portion of the business.\n\nIn addition, KLIC's management noted that its new vertical fan-out technology can reduce the form factor of memory packages by some 40%. While the first applications are just rolling out for low-power DRAM, management noted that one of its customers has a roadmap to use the packaging technology in HBM for AI applications, so that could also be a big AI opportunity.\n\nIn 2025, these advanced processes should take off, and the company's other legacy businesses in traditional ball bonding and auto battery packaging should also recover. With a 1.7% dividend and an increasing amount of share buybacks, KLIC could very well be an AI laggard that bounces back in a big way next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Onto Innovation right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Onto Innovation, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Onto Innovation wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Rivals Gold as Shield Against Inflation, Survey Shows",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The biggest US tech stocks are not only a bet on innovation but also a possible hedge against inflation, according to some respondents in the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Appoints Economist as Defense Minister in Shock Reshuffle Trump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind How One Brooklyn Neighborhood Became a Nightclub Haven Trump Pledges Across-the-Board Tax Cuts If He Returns to Office\n\nGold, the haven of choice for decades, is still seen as the best safeguard against the risk of rising prices, according to 46% of survey participants. But nearly a third said the tech behemoths are their first pick for the role.\n\nThe response highlights the dominant role that companies like Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. are playing in the US financial markets as they expand their sway over major swaths of the economy. That has allowed them to generate steady profits, stoking rallies that are making investors confident that they will continue to be a source of solid gains.\n\nInflation in the US has come down significantly from the scorching levels in 2022, but it surpassed economists’ expectations during the first three months of the year and has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.\n\nThat has left price increases by and large the biggest concern among investors. A majority of the survey’s respondents — 59% of 393 — cited resurgent inflation as the top tail risk facing financial markets between now and the end of the year. The next reading of the consumer price index is scheduled for this Wednesday and is likely to come around 3.4%.\n\nNvidia, for example, has surged more than six times since inflation first rose past 2% in March 2021. Even Apple Inc., which has seen peaks and valleys, has outperformed the broader market in that timeframe, gaining over 50% to the S&P 500’s roughly 30%. Still, like other growth stocks, tech companies are sensitive to changes in inflation and interest-rates, because their valuations hinge largely on future profits.\n\nAbout a quarter of respondents pointed to a US recession as the top risk of 2024. In that case, Treasuries and not stocks would offer a better shield, the survey shows.\n\nRead more: We Need to Talk About Recession Risk Again: MacroScope\n\nThe surprising resilience of the economy despite the Fed’s tighter monetary policy has kept cash flowing into the US, where bond yields are high and corporate profits continue to grow.\n\nThe influx has been fueling a renewed rise in the US dollar, which is overwhelmingly seen as the best currency for weathering times of market turmoil.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the respondents said the dollar was the best haven currency, with the Swiss franc getting about 23% of the vote and the Japanese yen about six times less. Among respondents from the US and Canada, dollar got 86% of the vote, while in Europe, 43% of participants went for the Swiss currency.\n\nThe yen has lost its haven status because of its depreciation against the dollar and due to Japan’s ultra-easy monetary policy, the survey showed. The yawning gap between interest rates in Japan and the US has sent the yen to the lowest levels since 1990 earlier this year.\n\nRead more: Gold Rally Makes It Look More Like Hedge Than Haven: Macro View\n\nGold is up almost 15% this year with the People’s Bank of China as one of the largest sources of demand. With the confiscation of Russia’s dollar assets in the wake of the war in Ukraine, many countries are trying to diversify away from the dollar, with gold a natural beneficiary. Only 13% of respondents in the MLIV Pulse survey said that the search for geopolitically unaligned assets has benefited Bitcoin.\n\nThe MLIV Pulse survey is conducted among Bloomberg readers on the terminal and online by Bloomberg’s Markets Live team.

        "title": "3 Top AI Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be one of the biggest revolutionary advancements in technology that the world has ever seen. Companies are just starting to embrace the technology and what it can do. However, the early results are very promising, allowing organizations to become more efficient and better serve their customers.\n\nBut make no mistake, artificial intelligence is still in its early days, and there are a lot of opportunities for investors to profit from companies helping lead the way with AI. Let's look at some of the best stocks to play the AI bull run.\n\nNvidia\n\nNo company is benefiting more from AI at the moment than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The maker of graphics processing unit (GPUs) has become the backbone of the infrastructure needed to power AI applications in data centers. GPU chips are able to do technical calculations faster and with less energy than central processing units (CPUs), which makes them ideal for use in AI training and inference.\n\nNvidia's GPUs, meanwhile, have become the industry gold standard due to its CUDA software platform, which allows its chips to be programmed directly, saving customers time and money.\n\nNvidia will continue to be the go-to company for building out the more powerful data centers needed to power AI applications. Meanwhile, Nvidia isn't a one-trick pony, and its networking business is also greatly benefiting from AI.\n\nNvidia has been putting up incredible growth, including a more than tripling of its revenue during its most recent quarter. Despite that, the stock is attractively valued at only a 36 forward P/E, setting it up for a bull run as the business grows and investors push up the stock price. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAmazon\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be the first stock that comes to mind. However, the e-commerce giant has been heavily investing in the technology.\n\nThe company owns the largest cloud business, Amazon Web Services or AWS, which is benefiting from the proliferation of AI. It has also developed two chips, Trainium and Inferentia, to be used specifically for AI applications.\n\nOn the software side, the company has developed platforms to help customers build their own AI models and applications. Its SageMaker platform helps customers build, train, and deploy machine learning models, while its Bedrock platform gives customers high-performing models from Amazon and other leading AI companies through a single API to help them build AI applications.\n\nAmazon has also built out its own AI-powered assistant for software developers, Amazon Q. The AI assistant can write, test, and debug code. It can also answer questions about company policies, products, and other topics.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has shown in the past that it is willing to spend big to ultimately win big, and AI appears to be no exception. Trading at a forward P/E of around 41, the stock has room to run given the AI growth opportunities in front of the company. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nShares of SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) skyrocketed earlier this year on news that Nvidia had made an investment in the AI-powered voice assistant company. However, more recently, the stock has come back down to a more reasonable level.\n\nSoundhound's technology helps voice assistants and humans interact more naturally, allowing users to ask more complex questions while getting better answers. The company has made strong inroads in the automobile industry and is making good progress in the restaurant space as well. However, the applications of its technology should expand far beyond these two industry verticals.\n\nThe company has an attractive recurring revenue business model whereby it gets royalty payments based on volume, usage, or the life of the product. For applications where no product is involved, such as with its restaurant offering, it uses a subscription model. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoundHound is still relatively small, generating only $46 million in revenue last year. However, it has a large booking backlog of $661 million, which if honored will turn into revenue over the next several years. The weighted average length of its contracts is about six and a half years, with more revenue backend loaded. Much of the company's backlog comes from its relationships with about 20 auto brands and having its technology built into new models of their vehicles.\n\nTrading at over 21 times forward sales, SoundHound stock is not cheap. However, its valuation has come down a lot in recent months, and it has a lot of potential to grow if it can continue to move its technology into more products. Getting into smartphones, for example, would be a game changer for the company and the stock.

Broadcom reported 46% year-over-year growth for this segment and expects 35% full-year growth in Networking because its big data center customers (like Alphabet) rely more heavily on Broadcom for custom silicon AI services.\n\nFor the record, as of the last quarter (Q1 fiscal 2024), nearly half of Broadcom's semiconductor revenue came from the company's Networking segment. Given that other areas of the business (smartphone, telecom, and industrial semiconductors) could falter a bit in 2024, Broadcom expects to exit this year as a leader in data center AI semiconductor sales. Overall, the chip segment is expected to tick up by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage compared to 2023.\n\nAt the heart of Broadcom's success in AI are its Jericho3-AI Fabric chip and the Tomahawk 5 Ethernet switch chip. Both of these devices help power the servers that coordinate the massive amounts of data flowing through a data center. These devices are helping Broadcom customers string together tens of thousands of GPU chips (like the ones Nvidia develops) for AI training. And as AI models get bigger and more customers begin using them after they're trained, Broadcom is working toward stringing together 1 million GPUs to build massive supercomputers of the future.\n\nBut these days, Broadcom is more than just a chip-and-computing-hardware company. After the mega-acquisition of cloud computing enterprise software company VMware late in 2023, it now offers the management tools its data center customers need once all those new chips are installed. Included in the portfolio of enterprise software is the Private AI Foundation. Similar to VMware's Cloud Foundation, Private AI Foundation works with Nvidia and others to patch together all the hardware and software tools an organization needs to operate its newfound AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis makes Broadcom a superb bet on not just AI semiconductors but also AI software.\n\nThe Broadcom business advantage\n\nLongtime Broadcom shareholders know this is never going to be the fastest-growing business. That's due largely to its highly diversified nature. But what it lacks in all-out growth Broadcom makes up for in profitability. In fact, that's CEO Hock Tan's management hallmark: acquiring complementary businesses and then giving them the private equity treatment by whittling the acquired entity down to its most profitable core operation.\n\nThis is what Broadcom is in the midst of doing with VMware -- breaking off smaller parts of the business and selling them or refocusing attention on the biggest customers. It's controversial, but it actually seems to have shifted the previously stagnant VMware operation into growth mode again. Tan and the top team reported an expectation for VMware revenue to grow by double-digit percentages in each subsequent quarter through the rest of this year.\n\nA couple of months ago, I was leery of calling Broadcom a top semiconductor stock buy. But after seeing some big tech earnings results (from Meta, Google, and Amazon, for example), with expectations for big increases in data center spending this year and beyond, I'm changing my mind.\n\nThe stock still trades for about 31 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, just as it did after the last earnings update. But with a flood of new data center and AI spending likely in the next couple of years, Broadcom could be a massive winner on both the chip and software fronts. So today's stock price could still be a long-term bargain for this proven market beater. I plan on adding a bit more to my Broadcom position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Utility stocks are on fire — here are Wall Street analysts' top picks",
        "content": "Utility stocks have turned into leaders recently, gaining more than 4% over the past five days to close out their best week of the year.\n\nThe S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up more than 12% year to date in a reversal from last year when investors soured on the sector due to expensive projects and high interest rates.\n\nThe prospects of lower rates later this year and increased long-term demand for electricity from artificial intelligence has made the defensive part of the market look attractive, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\n\"The excitement surrounding AI has left many investors searching for the next big thing after meteoric rallies in names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI),\" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in a recent note.\n\nEnergy consumption is expected to dramatically increase amid a boom in data center growth.\n\nAdditionally, a re-shoring of manufacturing, which requires more power for battery plants and chipmaking factories, and the proliferation of charging stations for electric vehicles are expected to drive a surge in energy demand.\n\n\"Power demand [in the US] for the first time in 15 years is actually growing,\" Neil Kalton, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG)\n\nConstellation Energy is the largest owner of nuclear plantsin the US. The Baltimore-based company has been a beneficiary of the government's push to transition to green energies and growing power demand from data centers.\n\nConstellation shares are up more than 85% year to date as the company forecasts base earnings to grow by at least 10% annually through the decade.\n\n\"It is absolutely a growth stock and has attracted growth investors,\" said Well Fargo's Kalton.\n\nThe analyst highlights that Constellation produces power at roughly $25 per megawatt hour, while the government's Inflation Reduction Act allows for a selling price floor of $45 per megawatt hour, providing a minimum of $20 margin per megawatt hour.\n\n\"There is no limit to the profits they can make,\" said Kalton.\n\nWall Street is also bullish on the possibility of Big Tech building large-scale data centers with Constellation at their nuclear sites.\n\n\"The appeal of non-regulated nuclear, which is what Constellation owns, is that you could build a data center on the land at site and just directly hook into the data power plant there and take power,\" said Kalton.\n\nDuring the company's earnings call CEO Joseph Dominguez highlighted the massive amount of energy hyperscalers will require.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We're going to need data centers that are of size and dimension from a megawatt standpoint that is far beyond what currently exists out there in the market,\" said Dominguez.\n\n\"The data economy and Constellation's nuclear energy go together like peanut butter and jelly. And as such, we're in advanced conversations with multiple clients, large, well-known companies that you all know, about powering their needs,\" he added.\n\nConstellation has been operating as a standalone energy provider since 2022 after a spin-off from utility giant Exelon (EXC). The company has been buying back shares and recently upped its dividend ahead of its earnings due on Thursday.\n\nThe stock has eight Buy, five Hold, and zero Sell analyst recommendations. Constellation Energy operates the nation's largest fleet of nuclear power plants, including Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant on the Chesapeake Bay in Lusby, Maryland. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) (Baltimore Sun via Getty Images)\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\n\nThe $147-billion-market-cap company is one of the largest electric power generators in the country. While NextEra owns a regulated utility in Florida, investors are more interested in its non-regulated part of the business, NextEra Energy Resources, which involves developing renewable energy in the US.\n\n\"The demand for renewables over the next five to 10 years is set to explode,\" said Kalton.\n\nNextEra foresees annual earnings growth of 6% to 8% through 2026.\n\nThe company's CEO highlighted the boom in data center power needs and the onshoring of manufacturing capabilities to the US as reasons for the surge in demand.\n\n\"The re-domestication of industry in the US supported by public policy will drive the need for more electricity,\" CEO John Ketchum told analysts in April.\n\nThe stock is up about 20% year to date. The stock has 17 Buy, five Hold, and one Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nSouthern Company (SO)\n\nAmong the regulated utilities, Southern Company is one of the best performers inside the Utility sector year to date, with shares up more than 10%.\n\nThe company has benefited from data centers looking to build in the Georgia area, which represents higher electricity usage.\n\nLast year Southern's subsidiary Georgia Power debuted the first nuclear reactor plant built from scratch in decades. Currently four nuclear units are in operation.\n\nThe Atlanta-based energy provider recently posted first quarter earnings per share 14% higher than the same period last year. Sales to data centers were up over 12% for the quarter compared to the same period in 2024.\n\n\"This is what making history looks like. These are the first new nuclear units built from the ground up here in the United States in over 30 years and we are proud to be the company that saw it through,\" Southern's CEO Chris Womack said during the company's latest earnings call.\n\nSouthern shares are up 9% year to date. The stock has 11 Buy, seven Hold, and three Sell analyst recommendations.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter at @ines_ferre.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) continue to crush the market. The leading designer of accelerator chips for the explosive artificial intelligence (AI) market has seen a 215% stock price run in 52 weeks, including an 82% jump since the start of 2024. Nvidia is going from strength to strength, beating analyst estimates in each earnings report and building a mountain of AI-based profits.\n\nBut the stock market has priced a lot of future success into Nvidia's stock. The AI hardware master trades at kingly valuation ratios such as 75 times earnings and 34 times sales. I completely understand if you're not comfortable buying into a trillion-dollar stock at these lofty prices, no matter how bright its future might be. After all, I sold some of my own Nvidia stock a couple of months ago in order to reinvest some winnings in lower-priced growth stocks.\n\nLet's look at two tech stocks that, like Nvidia, have strong growth potential today. One is available at a far more attractive valuation, and the other operates in a less crowded industry.\n\nThis ad-tech stock makes sense with a lofty price\n\nForget flashy AI breakthroughs for a moment. Do you want to invest in the backbone of the internet economy?\n\nThe Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) is disrupting one of the most fundamental aspects of the modern digital world -- targeted advertising. As the leading independent platform on the ad-buying side of the equation, TTD is at the forefront of reshaping how companies reach customers across the rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nIts dedication to research and development, evidenced by consistently increasing R&D spending, has positioned the company to lead the charge in an era without basic user-tracking tools like the third-party tracking cookie. TTD designed an alternative solution called Unified ID 2.0, is establishing this system as an industry standard, and stands ready to lean on it as the old cookies go away.\n\nAnd TTD's marketing solutions are striking a chord with advertisers desperate to wring the last drop of sales-boosting efficiency out of their limited budgets. This industry has been through a sharp downturn during the inflation crisis, seen in the form of restrained or even negative revenue trends across the industry. But The Trade Desk never got that memo, and its sales never stopped soaring: TTD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nI'll admit that The Trade Desk's stock is about as richly priced as Nvidia's. However, I'm less worried about competitive pressure in this case, and The Trade Desk stands much earlier in a story of long-term growth across enormous target markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo if you're looking for an investment that directly drives how businesses operate in the digital era, TTD might be a smarter bet than Nvidia's more speculative investment thesis.\n\nHere's a rocket ship held down by gravity\n\nNow I'm getting to the stock that actually holds the bulk of my Nvidia gains.\n\nMedia-streaming technology expert Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU)absolutely crushed Wall Street's consensus estimates in the first quarter of 2024. Revenues came in 4% above the average analyst estimates and the net loss was about half as deep as Wall Street expected.\n\nReports like that are usually fodder for skyrocketing stock price gains. Instead, Roku's shares fell more than 10% the next day, adding more pain to an already sunken stock chart. The price drop stemmed from modest guidance for the next quarter, where the year-over-year comparisons will be made against a 2023 period where revenues rose on a price increase and a richer mix of ad-infused services.\n\nI get it. The digital advertising downturn is still in effect, though it's fading out in a healthier economy. And nobody likes to see annual comparisons go down, even if it's because the year-ago results were artificially boosted and hard to match. Oh, and the targeted advertising market is teeming with both new and experienced channels, all trying to grab a large slice of the available ad-buying action.\n\nBut you shouldn't stop reading Roku's guidance at that point. Go on for just a few more sentences, and you'll run into a more optimistic analysis.\n\n\"We remain confident in our ability to accelerate the growth of Platform revenue and continue to grow Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in 2025 and beyond,\" the management team stated. \"Roku has a direct relationship with more than 81 million Streaming Households, and we are deepening relationships with third-party platforms including DSPs, retail media networks, and measurement partners. Our business remains well positioned to capture the billions of dollars in traditional TV ad budgets that will shift to streaming.\"\n\nIn other words, the company is poised to soar as the ad market stabilizes and then takes off. You may have to wait until 2025, but the launch is coming. Remember The Trade Desk from the scribblings above? Well, Roku just entered a partnership with that ad-selling expert to put Roku's ad-serving properties in easy reach for TTD's buyers.\n\nSo Roku investors have a lot to look forward to. Meanwhile, the stock stands 47% below its yearly highs and an astounding 88% below the peaks of 2021. Changing hands at just 2.3 times sales and 20 times free cash flows, Roku is a high-octane growth stock trading like a deep-discount value investment.\n\nNvidia's shares may rise from here but Roku's prospective gains look much richer -- and more likely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "You know artificial intelligence (AI) is reaching the mania stage when the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) headlines appear. However, many of the headlines don’t tell you to avoid AI stocks. Rather, they want to make sure that you don’t limit your focus to stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and miss out on some under-the-radar AI stocks.\n\nThe skeptic in you may believe these experts have an agenda. They may, but investing isn’t about certainty. It’s about making educated guesses. That’s particularly true of AI.\n\nEarnings season has a way of providing clarity. As companies report, investors get a better sense of companies that are turning AI into earnings. And, they can see stocks that are overhyped. But with so many names to choose from, it’s hard to keep on top of all the opportunities in this fast-moving sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese quiet performers, or under-the-radar AI stocks, have the potential for massive gains with a modest investment.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Person holding cellphone with website of US analytics company Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCathie Wood is fond of Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), whose forward P/E ratio is over 133x. However, objectively overvalued doesn’t mean a stock can’t be flying under the radar. That’s may be the case with Palantir.\n\nPLTR stock dropped over 12% despite delivering an earnings report in which the company “crushed it” in the U.S. according to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alex Karp. Revenue was up both sequentially and year-over-year (YOY) as were earnings. And, although earnings were “only” in-line with analysts’ estimates, it was still the largest quarterly profit in the company’s history.\n\nPlus, the company continues to grow both the commercial (40%) and the government (16%) arms of its business. After a year in which the company had over 50% growth in the commercial division, the 40% seems concerning. But it shouldn’t be. This is still strong growth.\n\nMoreover, Palantir has true believers such as Wood who bought 1.35 million of PLTR stock after the dip. And, it has a committee army of retail investors. It also has its naysayers. Those traders took their profits after earnings, but with the stock trading around $21 after earnings, there’s plenty of upside for long-term investors.\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) Brookfield Infrastructure logo on a phone screen in front of a blurred computer screen. BIPC stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nYou’ve heard of the term “picks and shovels stock.” Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) presents investors with a different way to invest in the growth of AI. A better way to describe BIP is as a company that buys the picks and the shovels.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, the master limited partnership (MLP) owns and operates critical global infrastructure networks. And in 2023 and 2024, the company has been investing substantial amounts in data centers, the are the backbone of AI. Also, Brookfield has invested in semiconductor fabrication facilities as part of its commitment to the sector.\n\nThat should catch the attention of investors who may think of BIP stock more akin to a utility stock than an AI stock. Yet, investors still get a stock with a forward P/E of just 9.2x and a dividend with a current yield of 5.33%.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nBefore you think about IBM (NYSE:IBM) as one of the under-the-radar AI stocks, the company has to be on your radar as a practical AI investment. Even IBM’s CEO Arvind Krishna acknowledges that the company’s AI story is still “in the early innings.” But Krishna also believes that the stock price doesn’t reflect the potential of AI. If that’s true, then now is the right time to consider IBM stock.\n\nIBM was one of the first companies to experiment with machine learning and AI. You may remember Deep Blue that beat Garry Kasparov, the chess world champion, in 1997. Today, IBM has Watsonx, a cloud-based data analysis studio, that helps enterprise customers make use of powerful generative AI tools using the company’s own business data.\n\nAdmittedly, the company may only have a limited time in which to start adding customers and winning over investors. But at just 17x forward earnings and with a dividend that yields 3.91%, it might be worth taking a chance on the evolving and adaptable IBM.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR.

        "title": "The Surprising Reason the S&amp;P 500 Is Starting to Look Cheap",
        "content": "One of the easiest ways to get a reading on whether the market is overvalued is to look at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500. With a P/E of 27, the index looks expensive compared to historic levels.\n\nBut the market is forward looking and cares more about where companies are going than where they have been. Let's dive into some encouraging market data that indicates the S&P 500 might not be as expensive as it looks at first glance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe data\n\nNew findings from business data firm FactSet Research Systems show that 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. For the quarter, the growth rate for the S&P 500 is 5%, the highest level since Q2 2022. Earnings growth has been incredibly strong -- so strong, in fact, that the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is now 19.9.\n\nAccording to FactSet, that level is still above the five-year average of 19.1 and the 10-year average of 17.8, but it is lower than levels seen at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year on March 31.\n\nAccording to Luxembourg-based ISABELNET, a firm that has been doing private research on the U.S. stock market since 1998, consensus analyst estimates for the S&P 500 are $242 for 2024 earnings and $278 for 2025. At a level around 5,200, that would give the S&P 500 a P/E of 21.5 based on the 2024 forecast and 18.7 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nHere's a look at how the forward P/E has performed over the last five years and how it is expected to fall to around 20 by Q2 2025. S&P 500 P/E Ratio Forward Estimate Chart\n\nIn sum, growth is strong, earnings are delivering, and the S&P 500 is at a reasonable valuation.\n\nFaster growth justifies a higher multiple\n\nThe composition of the S&P 500 is currently more growth oriented than in the past.\n\nThe technology sector makes up 29.3% of the index. Consumer discretionary, dominated by Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), makes up 10.4%. Communications services -- heavily weighted in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- makes up 9.2%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500, has 30% of its weighting in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a term for seven top tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Nvidia alone now makes up more than 5% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe shift toward growth and tech has led to dramatic changes in the S&P 500 and fueled strong gains in the index led by megacap growth stocks. Growth stocks tend to fetch a premium valuation relative to their trailing earnings because investors are willing to pay up for the prospect of future earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith more and more of the S&P 500 allocated to growth stocks, it stands to reason its valuation should be higher than historic levels. By the same token, if the most valuable companies were instead safe, stodgy dividend-paying behemoths, we would expect the S&P 500's multiple to be lower than prior levels.\n\nTo see how growth can make an expensive stock look more affordable, let's look at the forward earnings estimates of the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNotice that Alphabet and Meta Platforms have roughly the same forward P/E as the S&P 500 despite being high-quality cash cows with above-average growth prospects and impeccable balance sheets.\n\nEven Nvidia, which embodies artificial intelligence-fueled market euphoria, has a 35.9 forward P/E -- which is less than half of its current 75.9 P/E ratio -- because consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings to double over the next year.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe stock market can do just about anything in the short term. But over the long term, it's all about how much money companies are making and how much they are expected to make in the future.\n\nIf you were to look solely at big tech stock prices or the levels of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, you might conclude that this market rally looks overextended. But earnings have delivered and are backing up the rally.\n\nThe lesson here is that price doesn't dictate value. Growth stocks were way oversold at the end of 2022, so there was some initial catching up to do in 2023. But the rally has persisted since then because of earnings growth.\n\nOverall, the stock market looks healthy and is going up for generally the right reasons. But there will always be pockets of speculation and greed.\n\nTo filter out the noise, focus on the underlying investment theses of the companies you like: their performance, what's driving or hindering results, and whether the valuation makes sense. This approach will help ensure you invest in a company for the right reasons and will allow you to stay on an even keel no matter how choppy the market becomes.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,115!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $34,588!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $329,437!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 6, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "The stock market has trended higher over the last month as this has proven to be one of the best earnings seasons in years. With over three-quarters of companies having now reported, earnings have grown around 5% in the last quarter. As one of the biggest gains since the pandemic and beats analysts’ expectations, it begs the question of which stocks to sell now. Notably, gains ensued despite concerns the Fed may not cut interest rates as soon as initially anticipated. In fact, the Fed is less inclined to cut precisely because economic activity remains strong.\r\n\r\nWhile this is generally positive news, some analysts are worried the market has gotten ahead of itself. It keeps trending higher, with valuations too high. Almost half of professional traders believe the market is overvalued, making it a good time to think about which stocks to sell now. Whether an imminent reversal occurs or not, certain vulnerable companies are more vulnerable than others.\n\nSome stocks to sell now might have seen gains, hoping to replicate competitors’ earnings. Investors are still flocking to AI-adjacent stocks, hoping for performances akin to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This has left several stocks overdue for correction. They have exceeded fair value and would be reasonable candidates to purge from a well-rounded portfolio ASAP.\n\nThe following are three stocks to sell now:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront. Peloton layoffs\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) is one of the stocks to sell now. It saw significant growth during the pandemic lockdowns but has struggled to perform even as life returned to normal. Even when consumers exercised at home during lockdowns, Peloton could not generate profits, and losses continued to mount.\n\nMost recently, the company received a brief boost when reports of private equity firms expressing interest in an acquisition surfaced. It was probably hoped a buyout might offer a higher price than the current market value. However, despite rising 13% in a single day, Peloton’s share price remains in the red for the year. This indicates the latest bump may be the last opportunity for holders to exit, making this one of the stocks to sell now.\r\n\r\nPeloton has consistently underperformed forecasts over the past several quarters. Its stock price has dropped 98% from its prior high as a ‘meme stock’ a couple of years ago.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) was one of the worst-performing stocks in April. It naturally earned a place as the second pick in a list of stocks to sell now. Unlike other stocks, it has not seen a rebound since it slipped lower. This might be due to its CEO having closely tied the company’s fortunes to the price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Recently, the cryptocurrency underwent its much-anticipated halving and has seen dropped lower. MicroStrategy’s 35% decline in April mirrored the underperformance of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven as Bitcoin trends lower, MicroStrategy continues issuing convertible debt to purchase more of the cryptocurrency, potentially diluting shareholder equity. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened amid expectations that bond yields would remain elevated for longer due to high inflation. This prevented the Fed from cutting rates.\r\n\r\nWhilst the all-in bet on cryptocurrency may work out in the long run, it represents a high-risk strategy given the volatility of digital currencies. Additionally, with the company recently reporting a net loss last quarter, MSTR is one of the stocks to sell now.\n\nWingstop (WING) A Wingstop (WING) restaurant storefront in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis fast-casual dining chain, Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING), shows promise. It is expected to open hundreds of new locations this year as part of its long-term goal of more than tripling its footprint. Unlike other stocks to sell now in this list, the company was profitable in the last quarter. However, investors appear to have invested heavily in hopes of gains that have not yet materialized.\n\nThis has pushed its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio up to a high 141x. As a result, it causes concerns for technology and restaurant companies that typically trade around 20 times earnings. Such a divergence makes WING yet another of the stocks to sell now.\r\n\r\nIts stock price has increased over 50% so far this year, outpacing its same-store-sales growth of 22% in the same period. While 22% sales growth is solid for a restaurant chain, the market still seems overly enthusiastic. This allows WING to be added to this list of stocks to sell now, as its share price will likely adjust to a more realistic level soon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "GOOG Stock Analysis: Unlocking the Future Potential of Alphabet in 2024",
        "content": "Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, advocates owning a small group of stocks. He’s willing to ride these best ideas for years. One of those best ideas is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.38 million Class C and 4.35 million Class A shares. Together, Pershing has nearly $2 billion in Alphabet stock.\n\nAckman’s stake in Google’s parent company accounts for more than 18.5% of his firm’s $10.4 billion in assets reported in its Q4 2023 13-F. With the two share classes combined, Alphabet is Pershing’s second-highest holding by percentage, surpassed only by Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) at just less than 19%.\n\nExcept for Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW), each of Pershing’s seven holdings has a weighting of at least 11%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou could argue that Alphabet stock should be the hedge fund’s largest position. Here’s why.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Alphabet Stock\n\nThrough Q1 2024, Alphabet’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $69.11 billion, 21.7% of its $318.15 billion in revenue. Adding up the trailing 12-month free cash flow of Pershing’s other six holdings, it comes to $11.88 billion, or about one-sixth Alphabet’s.\n\nBased on the other six’s combined revenue of $129.08 billion, the average margin is 9.2%, less than half of Alphabet’s.\n\nFree Cash Flow Margins — Pershing Square Capital Management Holdings\n\nCompany Free Cash Flow (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Margin Alphabet $69.11 billion $318.15 billion 21.7% QSR International $1.25 billion $7.17 billion 17.4% Lowe’s Companies $6.18 billion $86.38 billion 7.2% Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) $1.32 billion $10.20 billion 12.9% Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) $1.74 billion $10.52 billion 16.5% Howard Hughes Holdings (NYSE:HHH) -$266 million $999 million N/A Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) $1.65 billion $13.81 billion 11.9%\n\nAll the other holdings possess healthy free cash flow, except for Howard Hughes, a real estate developer who doesn’t focus on this financial metric. You can’t go out of business if you bring in more cash than you send out.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Pershing cut its Lowe’s holdings by 82%. Ackman likely left some money on the table as LOW stock hit a 52-week high of $262.49 in March. I would not be surprised if Pershing sold out of its Lowe’s position in the first quarter, given it paid an average of $100.43 a share.\n\nIf you take out Lowe’s numbers, the free cash flow margin for the other five stocks jumps to 13.3% [free cash flow of $5.70 billion divided by $42.70 billion], 840 basis points less than Alphabet.\n\nThere is no question that Alphabet is the best free cash flow generator.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Does It Compare to the Other Magnificent 7 Stocks?\n\nThere are 64 analysts covering GOOG/GOOGL stock, with 50 rating it a Buy with a $195 target price, 14% higher than where it currently trades. So, that’s 78% of analysts rating it a Buy.\n\nHere’s how it compares to the other Mag 7 stocks.\n\nAnalyst Buy Rating Percentages — Magnificent 7 Stocks\n\nCompany # of Analysts  Buy Rating % Alphabet 64 78% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 46 65% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 59 95% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 65 97% Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 59 88% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 51 41% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) 67 85%\n\nAt least from the perspective of analysts, Alphabet is not the favorite Mag 7 stock.\n\nI won’t review all the free cash flow margins for the other six Mag 7 stocks. However, Amazon, which has the highest Buy percentage at 97%, has a free cash flow margin of 7.7% based on $45.70 billion in TTM free cash flow and $590.74 billion in revenue.\n\nIn fairness to Amazon, if you exclude its e-commerce revenue, the free cash flow generation is much stronger. With all it has going with its ad business and AI, its free cash in about five years will be considerably more impressive. It’s not hard to see why so many analysts rate it a buy.\n\nNext up is Microsoft, which has a 95% Buy percentage. It’s more of an apples-to-apples comparison. Its free cash flow margin is 29.8% based on $70.58 billion in TTM free cash flow and $236.58 billion in revenue.\n\nSatya Nadella is one of the best CEOs in America. Since taking the helm on Feb. 4, 2014, MSFT stock is up 1020%, 544 percentage points higher than Alphabet over the same period.\n\nMSFT is the class of the Mag 7.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nLast December, I wrote about how Alphabet was spending money in all the wrong places. Notably, it had repurchased more than $100 billion of its stock over the previous two years. And while its underperforming shares made some buybacks worthwhile, it should have invested at least 50% of these funds in its business.\n\nThe company’s employees are fed up with shareholders getting all the benefits of its strong free cash flow.\n\n“Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases,” Fortune reportedCNBC comments made by an employee after the company’s blowout quarter. “When will employee compensation fairly reflect the company’s success and is there a conscious decision to keep wages lower due to a cooling employment market?”\n\nIf you can only buy one Mag 7 stock, Microsoft is the call. However, Alphabet’s free cash flow always keeps it in the mix.\n\nAlphabet is a Moderate Buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "At any given time, there is likely a hot story in the world of investing. Right now, that hot story is undoubtedly artificial intelligence (AI). Companies of all kinds are scrambling to present themselves as being in on AI, whether it's core to their business or not. That being said, because computers, automation, and technology generally drive much of modern society, it is conceivable that AI will eventually impact all or most industries in some way.\n\nThis marketwide focus on AI has also driven up the prices of the companies that have the most to gain from the rush to bring more sophisticated versions of AI to the market. The fear of missing out has put some great businesses into the valuation stratosphere. Here are three stocks that investors should keep an eye on for when there's a stock market sell-off and they become more reasonably priced.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIf there's a company that kicked off the artificial intelligence boom in the stock market, it's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). It was Nvidia's string of eye-popping quarterly results that got investors to notice the opportunity to invest in all things AI. Nvidia designs the chips that have proven to be very good at helping develop AI, and as a result, demand for these chips has been robust.\n\nNvidia's overall revenue has seen explosive growth, but that has been driven primarily by its data center segment, which is where the demand for chips used in AI is reported. Not only has this segment's revenue grown in each of the last five quarters, but the year-over-year (YOY) growth rate has accelerated.\n\nQ4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Data Center Revenue $3.6 billion $4.3 billion $10.3 billion $14.5 billion $18.4 billion YOY Growth 11% 14% 171% 279% 409%\n\nData source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia stock currently trades for 76 times earnings, which is not cheap by any means. However, considering the increasing rate of data center revenue growth and the continued demand for chips to power AI, it may surprise investors that the valuation has come down over the past year. Even so, at some point, demand will slow, and there will likely be more attractive valuations at which to accumulate shares of this great business.\n\n2. Arista Networks\n\nNvidia's impressive revenue growth was driven by the sales of chips that are used in data centers. These data centers are also a driver of results for Arista Networks(NYSE: ANET), which sells the switches and routers needed to run large data centers for the world's biggest tech companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe growth story for Arista has been less about revenue growth and more about the bottom line. In fact, revenue growth has slowed over the last few quarters, making the rest of its results even more impressive. In the recently reported first quarter of 2024, Arista reported earnings per share of $1.99, a 44% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Arista also generated $520 million in free cash flow, compared to $369 million in the prior year.\n\nArista currently trades for 42 times earnings, which is less expensive than Nvidia but still quite pricey. Looking back over the last five years, Arista's average price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is 34, and the average multiple for the S&P 500 is 25. Arista is certainly a quality business that deserves to trade at a premium, but there will likely be better buying opportunities in the future.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) may not be a household name, but it has a long and distinguished history in the world of technological advancement. With its products in data centers, broadband modems, computers, and cellphones, there's a good chance most investors have used one of their products without even knowing it.\n\nBroadcom reports its results in two segments: infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions. Historically, the semiconductor solutions segment has constituted 78% of Broadcom's revenue. However, the recent acquisition of cloud software company VMware has shifted the revenue mix, and infrastructure software now accounts for 38% of revenue.\n\nThe VMware acquisition resulted in a much higher year-over-year revenue growth result than is typical for Broadcom. Q1 2024 revenue growth was 34%, compared to the single-digit revenue growth seen in the previous few quarters. For the full year, the company is expecting revenue growth of $50 billion, which would be a 40% increase over 2023.\n\nBroadcom trades for a P/E multiple of 48, which is a significant increase from one year ago when it traded for just under 20 times earnings. Broadcom's acquisition of VMware is in its early days, so investors should watch how the integration of the two businesses progresses over time.

        "title": "Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Cut His Massive Nvidia Position. Here's Why.",
        "content": "Stan Druckenmiller is an incredible investor with a long track record of producing outsize gains in the financial markets. He worked with George Soros in the '90s, famously shorting the British pound. At the same time, he ran his own hedge fund, Duquesne Capital Management, which produced an average return of 30% per year without a single down year in the 30 years he operated it.\n\nSince closing the hedge fund in 2010, Druckenmiller has managed his personal wealth through the Duquesne Family Office, which held about $3.35 billion as of the end of last year. Nearly $550 million of that amount was held in stock and options of just one company, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nBut Druckenmiller said he cut his sizable position in Nvidia last quarter. And he had a good reason. Nvidia's headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nThe unprecedented run for Nvidia\n\nDruckenmiller said he took an initial position in Nvidia before the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the suggestion of one of his partners at Duquesne. Then, once ChatGPT was launched and grew its user base faster than any app in history, he increased the position substantially.\n\nSince ChatGPT's launch until the end of March, Nvidia shares climbed 434% and the company's market cap increased by $1.84 trillion in those 16 months. To say it's been on a historic run would be an understatement.\n\nDruckenmiller saw the potential for those types of returns, but he thinks the market might have fully priced in any further growth for Nvidia at this point. \"A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now,\" he said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nThe billionaire remains bullish on the potential for further advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the business opportunities they can create long term. \"AI may be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term,\" he said.\n\nAs such, he cut his Nvidia position. We'll have to wait until Duquesne files its form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission to learn exactly how much of the stock Druckenmiller sold last quarter. He also noted that he sold several other positions in late March. That form is due by May 15, so the wait won't be long.\n\nShould investors follow Druckenmiller's lead?\n\nThe current run in Nvidia's stock is fueled by spectacular financial results. Despite high expectations for the company, it has managed to beat those expectations more often than not. And continued demand from big tech companies for its data-center graphics processing units (GPUs) has many people excited about the company's future.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's unclear how long the chipmaker can continue to beat those lofty market expectations. Druckenmiller seems to think that the expectations for the company have reached an appropriate level and doesn't see the stock outperforming, based on its current price. Nvidia has a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 37.5, so the market is expecting huge earnings growth for years to come. That's a big ask for a company that's already huge.\n\nNvidia has benefited from being well positioned in 2022, just before the surge in demand for AI chips. But it might not have a sustainable advantage. In particular, it suffers from heavy customer concentration. One customer accounted for 13% of all of its sales in fiscal 2024.\n\nWhat's more, practically all of its biggest customers are designing their own chips for training their large language models and for customers to use on their cloud computing platforms. While some customers will continue to demand Nvidia chips, the biggest ones are weaning themselves off the company. That could hamper revenue growth and reduce gross margin, which has benefited from a supply shortage over the last year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Nvidia could find it hard to continue outpacing the overall market. There are better ways to invest in artificial intelligence right now. That said, Druckenmiller still thinks Nvidia will maintain an important spot in demand for AI over the long term. He said, \"I will be very surprised if I don't own Nvidia on and off for the next 10 years.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That's a Shoo-in to Join Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "If one topic has dominated the conversation since early last year, it's artificial intelligence (AI). Recent advances in the field have surfaced a host of new opportunities to improve productivity, generate new content, and streamline processes.\n\nIndeed, six of the top seven companies in the world -- when measured by market cap -- have one thing in common: They have embraced the potential of generative AI and are moving quickly to profit from these next-generation algorithms. Topping that list is Microsoft, the only company that currently sports a market cap of more than $3 trillion.\n\nOne company that seems destined to join the ranks of the $3 trillion club is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) only recently joined the elite fraternity of companies with a $2 trillion market cap, but seems ordained to climb to greater heights.\n\nLet's look at the multiple growth drivers that could combine to send Nvidia stock higher, and what it will take to achieve this lofty benchmark. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA (not so) secret weapon\n\nNvidia has long been known for creating the chips that generate lifelike images in video games. This is the result of its pioneering work in parallel processing, or the ability of its GPUs to process a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking the job up into smaller pieces and running them concurrently. The company quickly realized the vast potential of this process and worked to adapt the technology to other applications.\n\nSince then, Nvidia GPUs have been used to power AI, zip data through the cloud, run data centers, enable autonomous driving, and more.\n\nA track record of impressive growth\n\nOver the past decade, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 1,900% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged 9,500%. While this hasn't been in a straight line, the company's performance has been consistent, fueling epic growth in its stock price, which has soared 20,500%.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's results set new records across the board. Revenue grew 126% year over year to $60.9 billion, while fiscal discipline drove diluted earnings per share (EPS) up 586% to $11.93. The results were fueled by unprecedented demand in its data center segment, which includes processors used for AI, cloud computing, and data centers. CEO Jensen Huang left no doubt as to the future potential: \"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\"\n\nEven more compelling is the company's 2025 first-quarter outlook, which is guiding for revenue of $24 billion. This would represent growth of 190% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's still early days for the adoption of AI, but there's no denying the magnitude of the opportunity. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research estimate the economic impact at $7 trillion by 2030. Furthermore, we don't yet know how the evolution of AI will unwind, but most experts suggest the trend will only accelerate from here. As the leading provider of GPUs used for AI, Nvidia stands to reap the windfall from these secular tailwinds.\n\nMultiple growth drivers\n\nWhile much of the focus is on AI, there are a number of other opportunities that could drive Nvidia higher.\n\nChief among those is the gaming market. Many veteran and novice gamers upgraded to the latest and greatest processors during the pandemic. That, combined with the subsequent economic downturn, cratered demand for graphics cards in recent years. However, those gaming chips and the computers that house them are coming to the end of their useful life, which will act as a catalyst for the next upgrade cycle.\n\nTo close out 2023, Nvidia controlled an estimated 80% of the discrete desktop GPU market, and its graphics cards are still the gold standard for gamers. Demand is expected to surge over the next five years, climbing from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $11.7 billion by 2028, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34%, according to Mordor Intelligence. The market for gaming chips has already begun to rebound, a trend that favors Nvidia.\n\nLet's not forget the data center market, driven by the digital transformation. Many businesses are moving their data from on-premises to the cloud, another trend that benefits Nvidia. The company controls an estimated 95% of the market for data center GPUs, according to Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. The data center market is expected to grow from $302 billion in 2023 to $622 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 11%, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research.\n\nThe combination of Nvidia's dominance and the increasing market size puts Nvidia at the intersection of another opportunity.\n\nNvidia has long dominated the machine learning market, an established field of AI that's creating self-teaching algorithms. Nvidia controls an estimated 95% share of the market, according to data provided by New Street Research. It's little wonder then that those in the market for AI-centric GPUs are turning to Nvidia.\n\nHow it gets there from here\n\nNvidia's currently boasts a market cap of roughly $2.26 trillion, which means it will only take a stock price move of 33% to drive its value to $3 trillion. Given the company's multiple avenues for growth and the accelerating adoption of AI, it seems it's only a matter of time.\n\nGiven its meteoric rise over the past 17 months, any shortfall -- real or imagined -- in Nvidia's performance could crater the stock price, at least temporarily. That said, 36 times forward earnings is a reasonable price to pay for a company at the forefront of one of the biggest technological shifts in a generation, making Nvidia stock a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Is What the Latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Earnings Reports Say About Nvidia Stock's Future",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has continued gaining traction in 2024 as companies spend huge amounts of money on building up infrastructure so that they don't fall behind in the race to deploy and integrate AI applications.\n\nAccording to one estimate, global spending on AI is expected to cross a whopping $200 billion this year, and chipmakers such as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have allowed investors to get rich from this massive splurge. Looking ahead, the market for semiconductors powering AI applications is expected to deliver a whopping $341 billion in annual revenue in 2033. The latest developments in the AI chip market signal that Nvidia continues to remain the best bet for investors to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity.\n\nAMD's and Intel's earnings reports make it clear that they are far behind Nvidia\n\nNvidia enjoyed an early start in the AI chip market. Its A100 processors were used for training ChatGPT, the chatbot that kicked off the AI revolution toward the end of 2022. The company's AI GPUs (graphics processing units) gained immense popularity and its H100 processor became a runaway success.\n\nRivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel were left to play catch up as they didn't have a chip powerful enough to compete with Nvidia's H100. Both companies were behind Nvidia by at least a year on the AI chip development curve. This is evident from the fact that AMD's rival to Nvidia's H100, the MI300X accelerator, was launched in December 2023. Meanwhile, Intel's H100 opponent, the Gaudi 3, was announced last month and will start shipping later this year.\n\nNvidia's H100 went into full production in September 2022. This lead has allowed Nvidia to exercise a solid grip over the AI chip market and also explains why its competitors' latest offerings aren't gaining much traction. For instance, AMD sees its AI GPU sales hitting at least $4 billion in 2024. Intel is further behind and expects the Gaudi 3 launch to help it generate $500 million in AI chip sales in the second half of 2024.\n\nNvidia is leagues ahead of both Intel and AMD considering that it sold $47.5 billion worth of data center chips in fiscal 2024, an increase of 217% from the previous year. This also indicates that AMD and Intel's new chips, which were supposed to help them cut into Nvidia's 90%-plus market share, aren't making much of a dent in the latter's dominant position.\n\nOne of the reasons why that's the case is because Nvidia has cornered a huge chunk of the supply of AI chips from its foundry partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (popularly known as TSMC). More specifically, Nvidia reportedly commands half of TSMC's advanced chip packaging capacity that's deployed for manufacturing AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia is all set to widen the technology gap with its rivals with the launch of new AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture later this year. Market research company TrendForce expects Nvidia to secure a dedicated chip supply from TSMC for its next-generation chips.\n\nTSMC's monthly capacity to make advanced chips is expected to increase 150% this year to 40,000 wafers a month. By next year, TSMC is expected to double its capacity once again. The key thing to note here is that Nvidia is expected to consume more than half of TSMC's advanced chip packaging capacity. So, Nvidia's tight control over TSMC's advanced chip supply is going to help it keep the likes of Intel and AMD at bay.\n\nNvidia's AI lead is set to translate into terrific growth\n\nInvestment bank UBS recently increased its Nvidia price target to $1,150 from $1,100 citing the impending arrival of its next-generation AI GPUs. UBS is expecting the company to deliver $175 billion in revenue in 2025 (which will coincide with its fiscal 2026), along with earnings of $41 per share. Those estimates point toward a massive jump compared to Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue of $60.9 billion and $12.96 per share in earnings.\n\nAssuming Nvidia does hit $41 per share in earnings this fiscal year and trades at 30 times earnings, in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could hit $1,230 within a couple of years. That would be a 36% jump from current levels. However, Nvidia currently trades at 74 times earnings, and it is likely to trade at a premium valuation in the future as well thanks to its AI chip dominance.\n\nSo, it won't be surprising to see this AI stock delivering much stronger gains than what analysts are expecting, which is why it would be a good idea to buy Nvidia following the latest earnings reports from its peers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has been in fine form in the past year, clocking impressive gains of 50%, as some of the key components of this index have witnessed a red-hot rally thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nShares of Nasdaq-100 component Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), for instance, have shot up 221% in the past year. The chipmaker's terrific rally is justified by its outstanding growth. Nvidia's monopoly-like position in the market for AI chips -- where it holds 95%-plus market share according to some estimates -- has supercharged the company's top and bottom lines, which is evident from the chart below. NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\n\nWhat's more, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to increase at a healthy annual rate of 38% over the next five years. Based on Nvidia's earnings of $12.96 per share in the recently concluded fiscal 2024, its bottom line could jump to almost $65 per share after five years, according to analyst estimates.\n\nEven if Nvidia trades at 30 times earnings after five years, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple, its stock price could jump to $1,950. That would be a 112% jump from current levels.\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only stock that's winning big from the rapid adoption of AI. There are two other Nasdaq stocks that are making the most of the AI opportunity and they could deliver more upside than Nvidia over the next five years.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in the past year with stunning gains of 505%. Supermicro, which is known for manufacturing AI server solutions, can continue to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, thanks to the fast-growing market it operates in.\n\nSupermicro's servers are deployed by data center operators to mount chips from the likes of Nvidia and other chipmakers, which keeps their operating costs in check. Supermicro's modular server solutions aim to lower electricity and cooling costs in data centers.\n\nFor instance, Supermicro launched liquid-cooled server solutions for deploying Nvidia's massively popular H100 chips in May last year, claiming that they can reduce electricity costs in data centers by 40%. Additionally, Supermicro claims that its liquid-cooled H100 servers could reduce cooling costs by 86% when compared to existing data centers.\n\nConsidering the significant amount of electricity that AI data centers consume, the demand for Supermicro's servers is booming. This explains why the company's revenue and earnings grew remarkably in the previous quarter. Super Micro's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended March 31) tripled year over year to $3.85 billion. Its earnings jumped fourfold to $6.65 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro's full-year guidance now calls for revenue to increase 110% year over year to $14.9 billion at the midpoint. Earnings are expected to jump to $23.69 per share from $11.81 per share in the same period last year. Even better, analysts are expecting its earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years.\n\nThat won't be surprising as the market for AI servers is expected to clock annual growth of 30% over the next decade. Supermicro is growing faster than the market it serves, which explains why analysts are expecting its earnings growth to remain robust. Assuming the company's bottom line does grow at 60% a year for the next five years, its earnings could hit $124 per share after five years.\n\nMultiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $3,720 after five years, a 348% jump from current levels. Even if growth rates taper off, Supermicro still has a better growth probability than Nvidia. So, Supermicro looks like a solid alternative to Nvidia for investors looking to buy an AI stock right now, given that it seems capable of outperforming the latter over the next five years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is another tech giant that's capitalizing on the adoption of AI. The social media bellwether has been integrating AI tools into its different platforms and is also leveraging the technology to help advertisers increase returns on their spending.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's AI initiatives in detail on the company's first-quarter earnings conference call last month. He claimed that the company's generative AI assistant, Meta AI, has been tried by \"tens of millions of people,\" and it will be rolled out in more countries and languages in the future.\n\nMeta AI is being integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. From allowing creators to generate high-quality images to enabling businesses to suggest products for customers, Meta Platforms is setting itself up to monetize its AI offerings in the long run. According to Zuckerberg:\n\nOn the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\n\nThe good news for investors is that Meta's AI offerings are giving the company's growth a nice boost. Its revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $36.4 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, shot up an impressive 114% year over year to $4.71 per share. Meta should be able to sustain a healthy earnings growth rate in the long run as it starts monetizing more of its AI offerings.\n\nAnalysts are currently expecting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 28% over the next five years, which would be a nice jump over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years. Using its 2023 earnings of $14.87 per share as the base, Meta's bottom line could jump to $51 per share in five years based on the potential earnings growth that analysts expect it to deliver.\n\nMultiplying that with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $1,530 after five years, a 229% jump from current levels. Given that the stock is trading at 27 times earnings right now, investors are getting a good deal on this Nasdaq stock that seems capable of outperforming Nvidia in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Rival Nvidia’s 2023 Performance in the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The extraordinary performance of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2023 coincided with a seismic generative-AI rally that carried the entirety of the S&P 500 higher in a year that was punctuated by Fed interest rate hikes and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nNow, with the expectations of rate cuts finally arriving in the second half of 2024, we can look to more stocks posting similar levels of impressive growth backed by a more positive market outlook.\n\nWe were already handed a taste of what Wall Street would look like as headwinds cleared and interest rates fell. The expectation of Federal Reserve rate cuts were enough to see the S&P 500 break the 5,000 points mark for the first time in its history back in February. However, March’s consumer price index (CPI) inflation data weighed in higher than expected, pushing back forecasts for the Fed’s reversion into a dovish monetary stance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite stubborn inflation data, the Fed still predicts three quarter-point cuts by the end of 2024, indicating that the second half of the year will bring more bullish sentiment to Wall Street.\n\nThis will be crucial in empowering more stocks to emulate the success of Nvidia in 2023. Without the generative-AI hype cycle as a tailwind, the key to growth in the second half of the year will be down to optimism for recovering markets and the strong fundamentals of firms.\n\nWith this in mind, let’s explore three stocks that are well-positioned to rival Nvidia’s growth rates in the second half of 2024:\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (WBD)  A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s no getting away from the challenging start to the year that Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has experienced. With a decline of more than 35% over the first five months of 2024, WBD is now perched around 67.5% below its 2022 debut price on Wall Street.\n\nCompounded by Q1 2024 results that fell below expectations, Warner Bros Discovery has struggled to generate momentum this year. With a Q1 loss per share of 40 cents compared to 24 cents expected and revenue of $9.96 billion that fell below forecasts of $10.231 billion, it’s understandable to see the stock sink lower in recent months.\n\nHowever, the recent announcement that Warner Bros Discovery is set to form a partnership with Disney in a bid to rival Netflix could be a watershed moment for the stock.\n\nDespite its weaker Q1 2024 earnings report, WBD also announced impressive quarterly profits of $86 million for its direct-to-consumer (DTC) unit, which focuses heavily on streaming and pay-per-view TV services. This figure far exceeds the $50 million posted over the same period in 2023 and clearly signifies the value of streaming services for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe streaming collaboration, which features the combination of major services like Disney+, Hulu and Max, will be focused on rivaling the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\nGiven that WBD’s market capitalization is just a fraction of both Netflix and Amazon, and just 10% of the size of Disney, the successful rollout of its new-look streaming service could make the stock appear extremely undervalued, and a strong option for investors as confidence returns to Wall Street.\n\nBiogen (BIIB) BIIB stock: Biogen Factory Building in: Luterbach Solothurn Switzerland\n\nSource: PictureDesignSwiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that appears extremely undervalued is Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB). The post-pandemic landscape has seen investor sentiment flow in and out of BIIB in a way that’s generated extreme volatility for the stock.\n\nDespite experiencing growth of more than 80% between October 2019 and June 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent race for a vaccine dominated markets, the stock now sits at a value that’s lower than at any point in the year prior to the pandemic in 2019.\n\nSo why does Biogen hold so much potential in the second half of 2024? Its fundamentals are simply too good to justify such a low price today.\n\nThe biotech’s bottom line from its first quarter earnings saw Biogen’s non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted net income grow by 8% to $535 million, or $3.67 per share.\n\nThis positive news was buoyed by two products smashing sales expectations in the quarter. Firstly, the Alzheimer’s drug Leqembi, which was developed with Eisai, almost doubled its $11 million revenue projections by generating $19 million in sales. While Skyclarys also beat sales expectations, achieving $78 million in sales–some $9 million ahead of forecasts in Q1 2024.\n\nAs a result, Morningstar analysts have suggested that Biogen is undervalued by around 28%. With the tailwinds of a clearing market and higher product sales expectations as the winter months draw nearer, the second half of the year could make a strong springboard for growth.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other stocks mentioned here that offer opportunity because recent performance has caused them to become undervalued, we can look to United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) as an example of a stock that’s shown enough resiliency in a turbulent industry to suggest that it has much further still to run.\n\nUAL has rallied more than 30% at the time of writing, and this comes at a time of industry uncertainty and a historically high cost of living in the U.S. that could impact the volume of customers the airline receives in 2024.\n\nRecently, concerns have been raised over the firm’s exposure to Boeing, a plane manufacturer that’s come under fire for fears over vulnerabilities in its 737 MAX airplanes. However, while Boeing stock has fallen significantly over the course of the year, UAL has remained buoyant on Wall Street.\n\nBy posting growth despite major headwinds impacting the company, United Airlines has shown that it’s more than capable of sustaining its rally as wider market conditions recover. As the cost of living subsides and customers have more freedom to travel domestically and internationally, we could see UAL well-positioned to take full advantage of the holiday season later in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Unless you've invested from under a rock, you may know that artificial intelligence (AI) is the craze on Wall Street today. That's for good reason; according to research by Statista, the AI market will hit $184 billion this year and grow to more than $800 billion by 2030.\n\nIn other words, there is still time to position your portfolio to enjoy these powerful growth tailwinds.\n\nLife-changing investment returns are a high bar and a term probably thrown around too easily. However, if you pick the right stocks, a large and growing industry can turn modest investments into millions.\n\nHere are three potential millionaire-making candidates that long-term investors should check out for their long-term portfolio.\n\n1. The obvious winner\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) probably isn't some secret by this point. The multitrillion-dollar giant has been an early winner as AI companies fight over its GPU chips to power their AI models. Some estimates peg Nvidia's market share for AI chips as high as 90%, nearly a monopoly on what could be a $400 billion market, according to rivals. Nvidia has long specialized in chips for demanding computing applications, but its proprietary CUDA software has been integral in helping users easily unlock the chips' full computing power for AI applications.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia probably doesn't have enough room to grow market-cap-wise to make you a millionaire. It's already one of the world's largest companies. However, years of steady AI chip demand could make Nvidia flush with enough cash to drive outstanding investment returns by returning profits to shareholders as dividends (yes, Nvidia pays one) and share repurchases. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, maintains confidence in the company's competitive position. He quipped that Nvidia's product is so good that competitors could give it away for free, but it still wouldn't be enough value to displace Nvidia.\n\nTime will tell how true that is, as a $400 billion market will attract endless competitive efforts to dethrone Nvidia. However, one could argue that Nvidia only becomes harder to knock off the mountain the more widespread its chips become and the deeper Nvidia's pockets grow.\n\n2. The future tech giant\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is increasingly becoming a household name among investors. Its secrecy in working with the U.S. government and its allies had long shrouded the company in mystery. However, Palantir has aggressively (and successfully) branched to commercial markets. Palantir helps create and deploy custom software on its three platforms: AIP, Gotham, and Foundry. Its software could be considered an organization's operating system, analyzing data to help aid decision-making in real-time.\n\nStory continues\n\nA little imagination could illustrate the types of use cases Palantir could have within the government, where it's a close partner throughout the Department of Defense. The company is also loaded to the gills with $3.6 billion in cash, carrying zero debt. The business is generating cash flow and is also generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitable. Analysts believe Palantir's earnings could grow at an annualized average of 26% over the long term, meaning profits would double every three years.\n\nThat pace of growth is enough to compound over a 10- to 20-year time horizon, making Palantir a great buy-and-hold candidate. The company still has just 554 customers, leaving much room for customer expansion over the coming years.\n\n3. The underdog you're missing\n\nSentinelOne(NYSE: S) is probably not among the first three names mentioned if someone is asked to list three cybersecurity companies. However, underestimating its potential could cost you money. SentinelOne uses artificial intelligence to hunt for malicious network and device threats. While traditional antivirus software would look for known threats against a database, AI enables SentinelOne to identify and isolate never-before-seen threats based on how the AI charts out every file and action a computer makes. It can look for \"suspicious\" actors.\n\nThe company has received accolades for its product, routinely getting recognition from third-party technology firms like Gartner. Despite facing intense competition from legacy security companies and next-generation rivals like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne continues to grow quickly. The business could surpass $800 million in sales this year and is quickly improving its margins as it grows revenue faster than expenses. Don't worry; SentinelOne has enough cash to fund the business for years until it eventually profits.\n\nThe upside of SentinelOne is that it's a top-notch product, but it is a small company with a market cap of just $6.5 billion today. Long-term success could easily make SentinelOne stock a multibagger, so it's worth keeping an eye on the company as a potential long-term investment with more risk but more reward than your run-of-the-mill names.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock Going to $1,100? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.",
        "content": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has caused a paradigm shift in the direction of technology since early last year, and arguably, no company has benefited more than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard when it comes to AI, but some fear the competition is ramping up.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks investors are missing the forest for the trees.\n\nAnother leg up\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari retained Nvidia on the company's \"Conviction List,\" maintaining his buy rating on the stock and raising his price target to $1,100. That represents potential gains for investors of 22% over the coming year, compared to the stock's closing price on Wednesday. The analyst posits that Nvidia's processors will \"remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe analyst has a point. Competitors have been trying to take the crown from Nvidia for years, yet its technology is unsurpassed for processing AI. Alphabet unveiled Google's first Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) AI chip in 2015, and Amazon debuted its Inferentia AI chip in 2018.\n\nDespite those years of competition, Nvidia remains unchallenged. Why? The company spent 20% of its fiscal 2024 revenue on research and development, and its technology is light years ahead of its rivals.\n\nHari's channel checks suggest \"continued robust AI server demand,\" which will fuel Nvidia's future profitability. As a result, he boosted the company's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate for fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027 by 8%, on average. Furthermore, the analyst believes his peers have set their profit targets too low, which will drive \"another leg up\" for Nvidia stock.\n\nIt's good to see one of Wall Street's finest focus on the long term, as that's the real edge we have as investors.

        "content": "AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says\n\nThe recent earnings season has made it abundantly clear that the AI revolution is not just knocking on the door but has forcefully entered the tech world.\n\nThe impressive results from tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) underscored this transition, according to Daniel Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush.\n\nThese companies have reported “eye-popping capital expenditure numbers,” initiating an “AI tidal wave” in software and cloud development driven by generative AI.\n\n“The next phase of AI spending is now on the doorstep for the likes of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and many others,” Ives wrote.\n\nThe expert said companies were “laser-focused on deploying generative AI” across various sectors. Additionally, major players such as Meta and Apple were diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promised significant spending in the coming years.\n\nOther major players like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promises significant spending in the coming years.\n\nIves projected AI and related purchases will account for 8%-10% of IT budgets in 2024, a stark increase from less than 1% in 2023. This surge represented a “massive growth catalyst” in what he referred to as the “initial wave of AI software growth.”\n\nIndustry-Wide Impact and Consumer Trends\n\nIves highlighted Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft as leaders in this burgeoning field, with their influence paving the way for a trillion-dollar spending spree over the next decade.\n\nRecent consumer surveys conducted by Wedbush show “broadly positive” trends for Internet-related groups, with expectations of strong digital advertising growth in 2024.\n\n“Our findings strongly support our expectations for accelerating e-commerce and digital advertising growth in 2024,” Ives said, pointing to bullish indicators for Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft’s ‘iPhone Moment’\n\nDescribing the current phase as Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” Ives believed AI would significantly alter the cloud growth trajectory for the company in the coming years. “We see an acceleration of adoption for generative AI and Copilot activity,” he explained.\n\nThis trend is boosting Azure cloud deal flow for Microsoft, with AI use cases “exploding across the enterprise landscape.” Ives estimated that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services, there was an additional $35-$40 of AI spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s Foray into AI\n\nLooking ahead, Ives was particularly excited about Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where he anticipates the unveiling of a comprehensive AI strategy.\n\n“We believe Apple is set to unveil its long-awaited AI strategy to its golden installed base and developer community at WWDC,” he said.\n\nThis includes a new iPad lineup and the iPhone 16, which are expected to set new standards in AI technology.\n\n“The AI strategy at Apple will consist of an AI App Store that will be the foundational starting point for developers and AI apps,” Ives said.\n\nRead Now: Utilities Notch 7th Straight Session Of Gains: ‘Potential Derivative Play To The AI Boom’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Stocks Surge On Healthy Earnings Season, Rising Jobless Claims: This Week In The Markets\n\nIt's been a quiet week in the markets, marked by a dearth of major economic news and a consistent flow of positive indicators from the first-quarter earnings season.\n\nAs of May 7, 424 companies in the S&P 500 have disclosed their earnings, with 78% surpassing earnings expectations and 61% exceeding revenue forecasts.\n\nThe S&P 500 continued its upward trend, marking its third consecutive week of gains and nearly recouping losses from April, while the Dow Jones boasted eight consecutive sessions in the green.\n\nNotably, the utilities sector, as tracked by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), has emerged as the star performer of 2024, outstripping energy and doubling the tech sector’s performance, with some analysts attributing the outperformance to heightened power demand from data centers.\n\nConcerns surfaced regarding a potential job market slowdown following unexpectedly high weekly jobless claims. The figure reached its highest level in eight months.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment report revealed a sharper-than-expected dip in May, along with a worrying rise in inflation expectations.\n\nInvestors are now fully factoring in two interest rate cuts by year-end, beginning in September.\n\nAttention now turns to the forthcoming April Consumer Price Index inflation report on Wednesday and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks in Amsterdam on Tuesday.\n\nBuffett Sells Apple Shares\n\nWarren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) has cut its stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by 18%, signaling waning confidence as the tech giant faces challenges in its Chinese market.\n\nApple’s M4 iPads\n\nMeanwhile, Apple unveiled an iPad Pro with a M4 chip and OLED display, and an iPad Air with a M2 chip, enhancing the iPad lineup for the first time since 2022. The iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model — higher price points than older releases.\n\nTesla Cuts Jobs\n\nTeslaInc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has initiated another round of job cuts in China due to intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market, which is increasingly dominated by local rivals.\n\nPfizer Settles Lawsuits\n\nPfizerInc. (NYSE:PFE) has agreed to settle over 10,000 lawsuits related to cancer risks associated with its discontinued heartburn medication Zantac.\n\nNvidia Leads AI\n\nNvidiaCorp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been declared the de facto standard in AI technology by a Goldman Sachs analyst, who said the company will dominate the sector for the foreseeable future.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Stocks Surge On Healthy Earnings Season, Rising Jobless Claims: This Week In The Markets originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch\n\nPharmaceutical companies have been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for quite some time. Researchers have been using advanced AI models to understand disease mechanisms even before the recent surge in interest.\n\nWednesday, researchers at Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind developed AlphaFold 3, a new artificial intelligence (AI) model.\n\nAlphaFold 3 can predict the structure and interactions of biological molecules. This includes proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules that could function as drugs.\n\nAccording to the latest McKinsey Global Institute report, AI technology could generate $60 billion—$110 billion annually in economic value for the pharmaceutical industry, as it can help speed up the process of identifying compounds, their development, and approval.\n\nThe report adds that generative AI’s impact on pharmaceuticals is expected to be profound as the foundational models are built on languages, images, omics, patient information, and other types of data that come together to explain and solve the disease process and effective treatment ways.\n\nIncreased drug discovery, approval, and marketing speed can help companies resolve the asset life cycle compression issue, which is the diminishing amount of time companies have to capture the value of the new drug.\n\nMcKinsey’s research shows that the time has decreased to 9.8 years from 11.7 years over the past 20 years.\n\nDespite the speedy discovery, the average cost of discovering and developing new drugs has increased.\n\nGenerative AI using augmented foundational models can help accelerate pharma research, with drug discovery timelines cut by almost half. AI tech can have a potential economic value of $15 billion-$28 billion on research and discovery.\n\nThe report notes that, on average, ten years and around $1.4 billion are needed to bring one new drug to the market, of which 80% is associated with clinical development.\n\nGenerative AI addresses pain points by increasing efficiency across the clinical development process, unlocking the economic value of $13 billion to $25 billion.\n\nGenerative AI tools can deepen relationships between care providers, pharmacists, insurers, and patients to fine-tune campaign strategies in real time, per the report.\n\nPharma professionals and patients will have substantial data to make faster, smarter decisions, providing a potential opportunity of $18 billion to $30 billion.\n\nIn 2023, the World Health Organization unveiled a comprehensive publication highlighting critical regulatory considerations for harnessing the potential of AI in healthcare.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn April, Bayer AG (OTC:BAYRY) and Google Cloud announced a collaboration to develop AI solutions to support radiologists.\n\nKey players shaping the market include industry giants such as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Google, General Electric Co (NYSE:GE), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Amazon Web Services, and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article From Hype To Reality, AI Reshapes Pharmaceutical Industry Across Drug Discovery To Marketing - Stocks To Watch originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The 3 Best Robotics Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Today, we discuss three of the best robotics stocks to buy for long-term growth. The influence of robotics is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. From manufacturing and logistics to MedTech and even our homes, robotics is already transforming our everyday lives. In addition, it is revolutionizing numerous industries, from performing complex surgeries in healthcare to streamlining production lines in manufacturing.\n\nHowever, with a vast array of robotics companies vying for market share, identifying the best stocks can be a challenge. Therefore, this article presents three of the best robotics stocks to buy in May. These companies boast innovative technologies with real-world applications. Moreover, they exhibit robust financial performance and a clear trajectory for future success. By incorporating these leaders in the robotics revolution into their portfolios, investors can strategically capitalize on this transformative trend.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTopping our list of best robotics stocks to buy is Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER), a leading designer of automated test equipment and robotics. Its electronic test segment speeds time-to-market for new electronics, ensuring the functionality and reliability of semiconductors, electronic systems and wireless devices. Additionally, its industrial automation segment provides robotics solutions, including collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn late April, Teradyne delivered mixed first-quarter 2024 earnings. Revenue totaled $600 million, 2% above the high end of their guidance but down 3% from the previous year due to continued weakness in mobility. Net income dropped to $82.5 million, a 9.6% decrease compared to the prior year’s quarter. Earnings per diluted share came in at 51 cents, significantly outperforming the anticipated 38 cents but down 7.2% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nRecently, Teradyne announced a strategic collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to integrate advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to enhance collaborative robot (cobot) functionality. Live demonstrations have showcased a dramatic improvement in path planning speed compared to existing solutions.\n\nDespite the volatility on Wall Street, TER stock has gained a solid 15% year-to-date (YTD) and now trades at 38.9x forward earnings. As the Street placed a median 12-month price target of $122, interested readers may consider waiting for a pullback before buying TER shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nNext, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) emerges as another compelling investment opportunity in the robotics sector. This leader in industrial automation offers a comprehensive suite of solutions, encompassing industrial control systems, motion control technologies, information technology integration and factory automation software. These solutions enable manufacturers to automate production lines and improve data-driven decision-making and operational performance.\n\nRockwell Automation recently announced mixed fiscal 2024 second-quarter results. Revenue totaled $2.13 billion, down 6.6% YOY, while organic sales dipped 8.1%. Net income dipped 11.3% to $266 million, due to lower pre-tax margin. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surpassed expectations but declined 16.9% YOY to $2.50 due to lower segment operating margin.\n\nLooking ahead, Rockwell Automation has revised its full-year guidance downwards. Management now anticipates a 7% decline in organic sales at the midpoint and a 13% decrease in adjusted EPS. In response to these challenges, management is intensifying its cost reduction efforts, targeting $100 million in savings in the second half of fiscal 2024.\n\nSo far in 2024, ROK stock has lost more than 11%, while the stock is trading at 23.7 times forward earnings and 3.5 times sales. Despite recent price weakness, Wall Street remains optimistic, with a median 12-month price target of $300, implying a potential 10% upside. Interested investors can consider waiting for a drop toward the $255 area to initiate positions.\n\nROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nRounding out our discussion on robotics investments is the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSEARCA:ROBO). Since its inception in October 2013, net assets have grown close to $1.28 billion. ROBO, which provides exposure to global companies engaged in robotics, automation and artificial intelligence, has 77 holdings. The top 10 names comprise about 18% of the fund.\n\nThe leading sectors in the fund include Industrials (46.5%), Technology (39.1%) and Healthcare (12.3%). Teradyne, Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA), Fanuc (OTCMKTS:FANUY), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and Kardex (OTCMKTS:KRDXF) are among the top stocks in the ETF.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, ROBO has traded flat. Yet, the current valuation appears favorable, with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.6x. Given the importance of automation, we’re bullish on the ROBO. Finally, interested investors should also note the annual expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in NVDA stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

All three indexes were up for the week with the blue-chip Dow nabbing its largest Friday-to-Friday percentage advance since mid-December.\n\nCommentary from several Fed officials helped set expectations as market participants looked toward next week's inflation data.\n\n\"Nobody really wants to take a big position prior to next week,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \"And we’re getting into a time of year where people seem to slip out early on Fridays.\"\n\n\"The biggest story is the decline in Consumer Sentiment, but outside of that there isn't much to hang your hat on,\" Carlson added.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic acknowledged recent clues the economy is slowing, but added the timing of rate cuts remains uncertain.\n\nStriking a more hawkish tone, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said it was unclear whether monetary policy was tight enough to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2% target.\n\nHints of progress toward that target will come next week when the Labor Department releases its Consumer and Producer price indexes (CPI and PPI).\n\nAnalysts expect the crucial CPI report to show underlying \"core\" price of 3.6% year-on-year, which would be the coolest reading in over three years.\n\n\"The Fed is geared not to raise rates but cut them, so 'higher for longer' is about as dire as it's going to unless things really fall off the table,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor & market strategist at Murphy & Sylvest in Elmhurst, Illinois.\n\nOn Friday, the University of Michigan's preliminary take on May Consumer Sentiment showed the mood of the American consumer has taken its biggest monthly plunge since August 2021, while near- and long-term inflation expectations heated up.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 125.08 points, or 0.32%, to 39,512.84, the S&P 500 gained 8.6 points, or 0.16%, to 5,222.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.40 points, or 0.03%, to 16,340.87.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, consumer staples enjoyed the largest percentage gains, while consumer discretionary shares were the laggards.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings season is approaching its finish line.

Its reading of one-year and five-year inflation expectations rose.\n\nAnalysts noted they were focused on next week's consumer prices data to get more clarity on the Fed's monetary policy agenda. The consumer price index for April is seen cooling to 3.4% on a year-over-year basis, down from 3.5% in the previous month.\n\n\"This one will be very important because if we don't see some signs of inflation decelerating, that would be worrisome for markets,\" said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.\n\nA softer-than-expected employment report last week reignited bets that the Fed will make two 25 basis point interest rate cuts this year.\n\nTraders are currently pricing in rate cuts of 41 basis points by the end of 2024, according to LSEG's rate probabilities tool, with the first cut of 25 bps seen in September.\n\nTempering optimism about potential rate cuts, however, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said on Friday it's not clear if monetary policy is tight enough to bring inflation down to the U.S. central bank's 2% goal, and with price pressures still too strong, it is too soon for rate cuts.\n\nAt 12:03 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 57.48 points, or 0.15%, to 39,445.24, the S&P 500 gained 0.36 points, or 0.01%, to 5,214.46 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 33.79 points, or 0.21%, to 16,312.48.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost megacap stocks including Tesla, Alphabet and Apple slipped as U.S. Treasury yields rose.\n\nNvidia gained 0.8% after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest chipmaker and a major supplier to Nvidia, reported a near 60% jump in April sales.\n\nNovavax shares more than doubled in value after the vaccine maker removed doubts about its ability to remain in business and struck a licensing deal worth up to $1.2 billion with Sanofi for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSoundHound AI jumped 11% after its first-quarter revenue beat market estimates.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.67-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 151 new highs and 73 new lows.

        "content": "Akamai Technologies, Inc. AKAM reported modest first-quarter 2024 results, with the bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The company recorded a top-line expansion year over year, driven by solid momentum in security and compute verticals in multiple end markets. The planned buyout of Noname Security will significantly boost Akamai’s API security portfolio and enhance prospects.\n\nNet Income\n\nGAAP net income improved to $175.4 million or $1.11 per share from $97.1 million or 62 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was primarily attributed to year-over-year net sales growth during the quarter.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP net income was $255.5 million or $1.64 per share, up from $218.3 million or $1.40 per share a year ago.

Quote\n\nRevenues\n\nQuarterly net sales were $987 million compared with $916 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The 8% year-over-year uptick was driven by rising customer engagement in the Security and Compute businesses. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $4 million.\r\n\r\nBy product groups, revenues from Security Technology Group were $490.7 million compared with $405.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The 21% year-over-year growth was primarily backed by growing demand for Guardicore Segmentation Solution. Demand for Zero Trust Network Access Solution also remains strong. The company is witnessing healthy traction for its API security solutions in various end markets, including financial services, retail, electric vehicles and more. Net sales exceeded our estimate of $460.8 million.\r\n\r\nThe Delivery segment contributed $351.8 million, down from $394.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s revenues missed our estimate of $387.7 million.\r\n\r\nThe Compute segment registered $144.5 million in revenues, up from $115.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The company secured multiple cloud computing deals during the quarter, which includes a major luxury goods brand in Europe, one of the world’s prominent gaming companies and one of India’s biggest conglomerates. Its cloud computing portfolio boasts a solid customer base of more than 200 enterprise customers. The segment’s revenues beat our estimate of $140.2 million.\r\n\r\nRegion-wise, net sales from the United States came in at $512.3 million, up 8% year over year. International revenues stood at $474.6 million, up from $441.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nIn the March quarter, total operation expenses rose to $820.3 million from $789.1 million.

Adjusted EBITDA was $417 million, up from 11% year over year.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Akamai generated $351.9 million in cash from operating activities compared with $233.5 million in the prior-year quarter. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company had $467.7 million in cash and cash equivalents with $232.7 million of operating lease liabilities.

        "title": "With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor.\n\nBut Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs.\n\nThat might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun.\n\nThe AI wars\n\nThe AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nAI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips.\n\nAll of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks.\n\nQualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively. Qualcomm on Wednesday announced its latest chips designed to run on Windows laptops, taking aim at Intel and Nvidia. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nYou can’t mention AI performance without talking about Nvidia, but it’s almost unfair to compare its chips to the competition. That’s because Nvidia’s graphics chips are dedicated to graphics processing and can be programmed to run AI apps. But because they’re not multipurpose chips like those from Apple, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, they’re far more capable. In fact, Nvidia claims its laptop chips offer 20x to 60x the performance of competing neural processing units.\n\nThe point is, there’s a new stat for these tech companies to battle over, and you can be sure they’ll do just that. The fact that Apple had already come out swinging with its own measurement is proof enough of that.\n\nTOPS and you\n\nWhat does that mean for the average consumer? Not all that much just yet. Generative AI apps running on PCs and Macs and iPads are still few and far between. So far, there are programs that help you manipulate photos and videos or track your eye movement in video chat apps.\n\nBut there’s still no killer app that would get me to go running out the door to pick up an AI PC. That could all change in the coming weeks, though. That’s because Microsoft and Apple are set to kick off their annual developers conferences, where they’re expected to debut a slew of AI apps and services, and at least some of those should run on their respective devices.\n\nHow much they manage to entice consumers to pony up for AI PCs and the like, however, will depend on whether they’re truly useful or not.

        "content": "Sea Limited SE is set to release its first-quarter 2024 results on May 14.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been unchanged at 36 cents in the past 30 days. The figure declined 40.98% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is currently pegged at $3.62 billion, indicating 22.02% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nSE’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters while missing the same in the remaining three, the negative earnings surprise being 55.87%, on average.\n\nSea Limited Sponsored ADR Price and EPS Surprise Sea Limited Sponsored ADR Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSea Limited Sponsored ADR price-eps-surprise | Sea Limited Sponsored ADR Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.\n\nFactors at Play for Q1 Results\n\nSea Limited's digital financial services segment is likely to have experienced growth due to the diversification of its overall service offerings, reaching a wider user base. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 digital financial services revenues is pegged at $487 million indicating 17.91% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nSea Limited's key digital financial services offering, SeaMoney, is anticipated to have been the main growth driver for the segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued investments in user acquisition for the credit business, along with expansion into digital banking and insurance services, are anticipated to have driven SeaMoney's profitability in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe digital entertainment business of Sea Limited is expected to have benefited from strengthening user engagement and improved gameplay in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nThe launch of significant games, such as Garena’s flagship game, Free Fire, in its pipeline, and advancements in AI are anticipated to have enhanced its operational capabilities on the Garena platform.\r\n\r\nFree Fire achieved more than 100 million peak daily active users in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is expected to continue growing in terms of user base and bookings in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum across its e-commerce business, owing to its synergies with Shopee to improve service quality for buyers, enhance price competitiveness and strengthen the content ecosystem, is expected to have contributed to its growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). This, in turn, is likely to have aided the company’s top-line growth during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nHowever, the difficult macroeconomic environment, inflation and rising interest rates are expected to hurt SE’s topline in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

It is the exclusive producer of Nvidia’s most advanced training chips.\n\nIn April, TSMC shared plans to initiate production of its new “A16” chip manufacturing technology in the second half of 2026. Analysts told Reuters that TSMC’s latest technologies could contest Intel Corp’s (NASDAQ:INTC) February assertions of outpacing TSMC with its new “14A” technology.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC unveiled a novel technology that enhances the speed of AI chips by delivering power to computer chips from the backside, set to be available in 2026.\n\nTSMC stock gained over 68% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "Is AMD Stealing the Spotlight in Server and Client Markets? Here's What You Need to Know\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its market share for client and server categories in the x86 processor market. Despite intense competition in the market, particularly between AMD and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD continued to grow. Intel, however, made gains in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector.\n\nExcluding IoT and semi-custom products such as game console chips that AMD manufactures, Venture Beat cites Mercury Research.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Positions for AI Leadership with Expanded Portfolio, Quadrupled R&D Investment Ahead of Major Computex Announcements\n\nThe company again recorded gains in both client and server segments quarterly and yearly.\n\nDean McCarron of Mercury Research noted that x86 processor shipments aligned with typical seasonal trends in the first quarter, ending March 31, with all segments seeing moderate declines, which is typical for this time of year.\n\nThis past quarter marked the first normal market results across desktop, mobile, and server segments since early 2020 when the COVID pandemic began. However, IoT/SoC processor shipments fell significantly due to decreased console demand, impacting AMD’s SoC shipments. AMD reported a 48% drop in gaming revenue in the first quarter compared to the previous year and anticipated further declines throughout 2024.\n\nMcCarron explained that the statistics and share movements from the past few quarters better reflect how suppliers managed their inventory corrections. Most comparisons should be valid by the third quarter of 2024, although the year-on-year results are not.\n\nFor the all-inclusive share, which includes PC client CPUs, servers, IoT, and semi-custom products like gaming consoles, Intel gained 2.4 percentage points over the quarter, driven by AMD’s reduced SoC business.\n\nAnalysts flagged AMD’s significant gains in the server CPU market and its successful market share capture in the merchant accelerator sector with the Mi300 series, making it a formidable competitor to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the merchant accelerators market. They also flagged the untapped potential of revenue synergies from the acquisition of Xilinx, suggesting a long-term upside of over $10 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, after Arm Holdings Plc’s (NASDAQ:ARM) recent quarterly print, analysts flagged the British chipmaker’s ability to displace Intel and AMD as a critical beneficiary of AI adoption at the edge (phones, PCs) and traditional x86 in data center server CPU infrastructure.\n\nAMD stock gained over 57% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via AOT Growth And Innovation ETF (NASDAQ:AOTG) and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ).\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: AMD shares traded higher by 0.79% at $153.58 premarket at the last check Friday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy of AMD\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nADVANCED MICRO DEVICES (AMD): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Is AMD Stealing the Spotlight in Server and Client Markets?

Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment.\n\nThe interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market.

        "title": "Billionaire Bets: 3 Unexpected Stocks Hedge Funds Are Snapping Up",
        "content": "Investing in hedge funds is not something the average investor can do. Rules are in place to ensure these investment vehicles are the playground only for the rich. Small investors need not apply.\n\nBut you can still invest alongside the so-called “smart money.” Every three months investment managers have to file a Form 13F with the Securities & Exchange Commission. They detail the stocks they have bought and sold over the previous quarter. Scouring these reports gives you an idea of where billionaires are putting their money to work.\n\nWhile you might not get the same price for the hedge fund stock picks, that can work to your advantage. No investor, not even Warren Buffett, regularly nails the exact bottom for a stock. By buying in later than the smart money can often get you better prices. Of course, a stock can runaway after it’s purchased, too. So let’s see where the three latest big hedge fund stock picks below sit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree of the most influential names on Wall Street were piling into Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The vast majority of first quarter 13F’s haven’t been filed yet, but in the fourth quarter, the smart money bought over $16 billion worth of the second-largest artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Of that amount, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT) and Vanguard purchased $8 billion, or half the total.\n\nThey haven’t done bad, as Broadcom stock is up 16% in 2024 and some 45% over the last six months (hedge funds could have acquired their stock anytime in Q4). Still, don’t feel you’ve missed the boat on the AI chip stock.\n\nAlthough Broadcom is best known for the semiconductors it makes for mobile handsets, the chipmaker pivoted to data center infrastructure and its custom accelerators are in high demand. Broadcom reported first-quarter AI revenue surged 300% to $2.3 billion. It now expects AI will account for 35% of 2024 total revenue, or $10 billion. That’s up from its previous forecast of $8 billion. As data centers are a major growth market for the foreseeable future, there is still plenty of time to buy into AVGO stock.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023.

Of the $10 billion worth of UBER stock purchased in Q4, Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard were responsible for buying 57% of it, or $6.2 billion.\n\nAlthough Uber Technologies stock took a hit yesterday after reporting earnings and losing 6% of its value for the day, shares are up 37% over the last six months. Although CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah says Uber’s “multi-year growth framework is on track,” the market was disappointed with gross bookings which fell short of expectations. Still, the ride-share specialist expects to generate between $38.75 billion and $40.25 billion in gross bookings next quarter. That is an 18% to 23% year-over-year increase, suggesting this quarter was a one-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is good reason to believe Uber Technologies’ stock will continue on its growth trajectory. The ride-share leader is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles. The goal is to eventually squeeze out its human drivers so it no longer has to share a fare with them. While CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted driver earnings are “continuing to grow faster than our topline,” being able to keep all the money to itself will boost both revenue and profits. That is still well into the future but provides a growth target for Uber to aim for.\n\nNewmont (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nWith inflation refusing to go away, it is not surprising to see gold miner Newmont (NYSE:NEM) on the radar of hedge funds. Over $5.1 billion was invested in Newmont stock in the fourth quarter, and Blackrock and Vanguard were big buyers again. Van Eck Associates was the third major private equity firm buying last quarter. Together, they purchased more than 61% of the total.\n\nNewmont, though, has had a rocky ride. Shares are essentially unchanged in 2024 and up just 10% over the past six months. Considering an ounce of gold is up 18% in that time frame and this is one of those situations where retail investors can get just as good of a deal as the smart money, if not better.\n\nNewmont is certainly benefiting from the higher prices. First-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion was 71% higher as year-ago sales volumes rose following its acquisition of Newcrest last November. It’s only going to get better as the year progresses.\n\nThe gold miner should see sales volumes continue trekking higher as its Pennasquito, Ahafo and Pueblo Viejo mines increase production after numerous setbacks last year. Newmont should be able to overcome its higher unit costs if it keeps reporting solid results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Everyone who has tried generative AI knows it’s a transformational technology. And it isn’t a fad; artificial intelligence will be with us for decades. Let’s highlight some under-the-radar AI stocks to profit from this revolution.\n\nInvestors have increased their exposure to AI investments as the payoffs of the innovation become clearer. A major focus has been on semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and software stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While these industries might still have more upside, the AI impact is likely priced in.\n\nInstead, other companies in adjacent industries could have material upside as AI investment goes into overdrive. During Q1 2024 earnings, hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) disclosed increasing their capital expenditures to support their AI efforts. These capex plans have a straightforward implication: a multi-year AI data center buildout.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis capital expenditure bodes well for these under-the-radar AI stocks whose products go into AI data centers. Their products are integral in supporting the AI revolution.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne major investment area triggered by AI is the buildout of data centers. According to McKinsey estimates, U.S. demand based on power consumption could grow from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 35 GW by 2030. This creates an upside for one of the under-the-radar AI stocks, Vertiv (NYSE:VRT).\n\nDue to the significant computations, AI data centers run hot. That’s why Vertiv’s solutions are key to data center players. The company provides a portfolio of power, cooling and IT infrastructure solutions geared to this industry. For instance, it offers a range of data center cooling solutions to maintain optimal temperature levels.\n\nIndeed, Vertiv is heavily exposed to the data center at 75% of revenues. Furthermore, it is banking on its decades of experience serving the segment. Therefore, management is confident that they will capitalize on the AI trend.\n\nNotably, the company saw 60% organic order growth related to large-scale AI data center projects in Q1 2024. Pipeline velocity surged in the quarter, leading to an $800 million backlog increase, pushing the total to a record $6.3 billion.\n\nDue to the robust demand, Vertiv is ramping up production. Management expects expanding demand as larger projects come online. It will be a top beneficiary as a key supplier of cooling solutions for data centers.\n\nCummins (CMI) A Cummins sign in bright red.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cummings (NYSE:CMI) is mainly an engine and commercial components provider, it is one of the best under-the-radar AI stocks to buy. That’s because it’s one of the primary providers of backup power generators necessary to keep data centers running.\n\nData centers need reliable power at all times. Cummings provides a range of power generators that guarantee unlimited operation hours without limit on the average variable load factor. These backup solutions are critical, especially during power grid outages.\n\nDue to the robust demand, Cummings posted a 21% revenue increase in the North American power generation segment. Similarly, it revealed accelerating data center demand in the Chinese market.\n\nIn the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the robust demand from the data center market. CEO Jennifer Rumsey said they expect power generation revenues to increase 10% to 15% in 2024. She cited the data center market as the main driver and noted that some products were sold out through 2025.\n\nDemand for data center power generation solutions is surging. In line with this, Cummings has increased its revenue growth guidance for the power generation segment from 5%—10% to 10%—15%. This increased optimism makes CMI stock a top buy.\n\nEaton (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nEaton (NYSE:ETN) will be another beneficiary as the data center buildout to support AI innovation accelerates. According to Goldman Sachs, data center power demand will grow at a 15% compounded annual growth rate between 2023 and 2030. This will spur demand for the power distribution and backup power protection equipment Eaton offers for data centers.\n\nToday, Eaton’s equipment is integral to multi-tenant and hyperscale data centers, making it among the best under-the-radar AI stocks. For instance, most data centers use their power distribution equipment, which includes panelboards, switchgear, busways and transformers.\n\nEaton provided an update on the AI data center market after impressive Q1 2024 results. Management expects the market to grow at a 25% CAGR between 2022 and 2025. Additionally, they noted Eaton’s strong position in this market, which accounted for 14% of total revenues in 2023.\n\nRegarding forward growth, CEO Craig Arnold highlighted that orders had doubled over the trailing 12-month period. He also noted that the company had a strong negotiating pipeline. In the quarter, the project negotiation pipeline increased 169% year-over-year.\n\nThese solid fundamentals point to the momentum from AI data center growth driven by AI, big data and edge computing. The secular growth in data center demand makes Eaton one of the top under-the-radar AI stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have been big winners on the stock market in the past year, delivering stunning gains as their revenue and earnings growth soared thanks to growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware.\n\nWhile Nvidia stock has more than tripled in the past year, Super Micro's gains have been even more phenomenal at 474%. It wouldn't be surprising to see them sustain their red-hot momentum in the future as well. But if you have to choose one of these two AI stocks right now for your portfolio, which one should you be buying? Let's find out.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia is playing a crucial role in boosting the adoption of AI through its graphics cards. The massive parallel computing power of the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) allows customers to train AI models, formally known as large language models (LLMs), and also deploy those models to solve problems in the real world.\n\nCustomers across the globe have flocked to Nvidia's hardware to shore up their AI capabilities, giving the chipmaker a 90%-plus share of the fast-growing AI chip market. And Nvidia's dominance seems here to stay, as its competitors are way behind. Advanced Micro Devices, for instance, pointed out on its most recent earnings conference call that its revenue from sales of AI graphics cards would land at $4 billion in 2024.\n\nIntel, on the other hand, is forecasting $500 million in revenue from selling AI accelerators in the second half of 2024. Nvidia, for comparison, finished its most recent fiscal year 2024 (which ended in January this year) with data center revenue of $47.5 billion, which was more than triple the revenue in the preceding year.\n\nIn short, Nvidia is simply running away with the market for data center chips, a trend that's expected to continue thanks to the company's solid product roadmap. The chipmaker recently revealed its next-generation Blackwell B200 GPU, which is expected to be four times faster in AI training and a whopping 30 times faster in AI inference when compared to the current flagship, the H100.\n\nNvidia's H100 has been a runaway success, and it wouldn't be surprising to see the next-generation offering help the company maintain its dominant position in this space. The company's revenue from sales of AI chips is expected to multiply at an eye-popping pace in the coming years.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia's revenue forecasts for the next three fiscal years have received a big bump of late. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe company finished fiscal 2024 with record revenue of $60.9 billion, and the chart above indicates that its top line could multiply nearly 2.7x in just three years. Nvidia has a five-year average sales multiple of 18.7. A similar multiple in three years would send its market cap to just over $3 trillion, a jump of 35% from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is trading at a rich 36 times sales now. So even a substantially discounted valuation after the next three years could lead to a potentially impressive upside. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia commanding a premium valuation at that time thanks to its commanding position in the AI chip market, which is expected to clock annual growth of more than 36% through the end of the decade.\n\nThe case for Super Micro Computer\n\nJust like Nvidia, Super Micro Computer is also a play on the AI chip market. However, instead of designing chips, Super Micro manufactures AI server products on which the graphics cards from the likes of Nvidia are mounted.\n\nJust like Nvidia, Super Micro is a key player in the market for AI servers. The company gets more than half of its revenue from selling AI servers. Super Micro has generated $11.8 billion in revenue in the past year. Assuming half of that has come from selling AI server products, Super Micro's revenue from the AI server market should ideally stand at $6 billion.\n\nThe AI server market was worth an estimated $12 billion last year, indicating that Super Micro may be controlling half of this market. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting the global AI server market to hit $50 billion in annual revenue in 2029, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 26%. Super Micro, however, is growing at a much faster pace than the AI server market.\n\nThis is evident from the company's latest results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended March 31). Super Micro's revenue tripled on a year-over-year basis during the quarter to $3.85 billion. The company also raised its full-year outlook and now expects to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $14.9 billion, which would be a 110% increase over the previous year.\n\nSo Super Micro seems set to gain a bigger share of the AI server market. This explains why analysts have substantially raised their growth expectations for Super Micro, as evident from the following chart. SMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe chart above indicates that Super Micro is on its way to almost doubling its revenue in the next two years. Assuming the company does hit $27 billion in revenue after a couple of years and maintains its current price-to-sales ratio of 3.8 at that time, its market cap could jump to $103 billion. That would be a 124% increase from current levels.\n\nMore importantly, Super Micro's sales multiple is much lower than Nvidia's, and Super Micro stock is also trading at a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple of 6.8. So if the market decides to reward Super Micro with a higher multiple, it could deliver much stronger gains.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThe signs are that Super Micro Computer stock could deliver more upside than Nvidia. Moreover, Super Micro is way cheaper than Nvidia, as the sales multiples of the two companies indicate. What's more, analysts are expecting Super Micro's earnings to increase at a much faster pace than Nvidia's.\n\nThe AI server manufacturer's bottom line is forecast to increase at an annual rate of 62% over the next five years, outpacing the 35% annual growth that Nvidia is expected to deliver over the same period. So investors looking to buy one of these two AI stocks could consider buying Super Micro given its attractive valuation and the outstanding growth that it has been posting.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before the AI Chipmaker Reports Earnings on May 22?",
        "content": "The launch of generative artificial intelligence (AI) application ChatGPT whipped Wall Street into a frenzy in late 2022. While the generative AI revolution is still in its early stages, chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has already been a big winner.\n\nNvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year, primarily because interest in AI drove unprecedented demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Shares have now advanced 510% since the beginning of 2023, but there's a possible inflection point on the horizon.\n\nNvidia will announce first-quarter financial results after market close on Wednesday, May 22, at 5 p.m. ET. For context, the stock surged 16% following its exceptional fourth-quarter financial report, and shareholders are undoubtedly hoping for an encore performance. However, Wall Street analysts have particularly high expectations this time around.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock before May 22?\n\nNvidia impressed Wall Street with triple-digit growth in the fourth quarter\n\nNvidia crushed expectations with its fourth-quarter financial report. Revenue increased 265% to $22.1 billion on particularly strong momentum in the data center product category, due in large part to demand for artificial intelligence systems and software. And non-GAAP net income soared 491% to $12.8 billion.\n\nThe chart below shows Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue growth across its four primary product categories. The chart above shows Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue growth (year over year) across its four primary product categories. The fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, 2024.\n\nOn the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang attributed strong fourth-quarter results to two platform shifts. Data centers are moving from general purpose to accelerated computing and evolving into generative AI factories that turn massive amounts of raw information into digital intelligence. \"Nvidia AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this industrial revolution,\" Huang told analysts.\n\nGlancing back, Nvidia has now achieved triple-digit revenue and non-GAAP net income growth for three consecutive quarters, as shown in the chart below. The chart above shows Nvidia's revenue and non-GAAP net income growth (year over year) over the last five quarters.\n\nWall Street expects a phenomenal first-quarter report from Nvidia\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to increase 234% to $24 billion. Management also provided guidance for its non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin, and tax rate, such that non-GAAP net income is forecast to increase by about 416% to $5.62 per diluted share.\n\nBy comparison, the Wall Street consensus calls for first-quarter revenue to increase 240% to $24.5 billion, and non-GAAP net income to increase 409% to $5.55 per diluted share. Analysts also expect second-quarter revenue to increase 96% to $26.5 billion, with non-GAAP net income increasing 119% to $5.91 per diluted share.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported better-than-expected results in each of the last four quarters, and the company also provided guidance that meaningfully exceeded the Wall Street consensus in the fourth quarter. Anything less this time around could sink the stock. Alternatively, shares could soar if Nvidia beats expectations and guides above the consensus.\n\nNvidia has a strong presence in several parts of the AI economy\n\nThe bull case for Nvidia builds on its unique position in the AI economy. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like AI applications. Nvidia holds between 80% and 95% market share in AI chips, according to analysts. But the company is also gaining ground in other product categories.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia recently introduced a data center central processing unit (CPU). In the third quarter, CEO Jensen Huang told analysts, \"We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line.\" Additionally, high-performance networking equipment has become a $10 billion business for Nvidia, and its nascent software and services offering achieved an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn short, Nvidia is a one-stop shop for artificial intelligence, and Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari sees that as a key differentiator. As he wrote in a recent note to clients:\n\nWe believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities. Nvidia's annual introduction of new products and platforms sets a pace of innovation that keeps it at the forefront of the industry.\n\nNvidia stock looks pricey, so investors should be cautious\n\nThe graphics processor market is projected to grow by 28% annually through 2030, and AI spending across hardware, software, and services is forecast to increase at 37% annually during the same period. That gives Nvidia a good shot at annual earnings growth of around 30% through the end of the decade.\n\nWall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next three to five years. In that context, the stock's current valuation at 74 times earnings looks pricey.\n\nPersonally, I would wait for a cheaper multiple, but investors intent on buying the stock today should start with a very small position. Expectations surrounding first-quarter earnings are sky-high, so there's a very real possibility that shares plunge following the report.\n\nIf that happens, patient investors should consider buying a bigger position in Nvidia at that time. If it doesn't happen, plenty of other companies are well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has grown remarkably, soaring approximately 490% in under two years. However, Meta recently saw its most significant market cap decline since 2022, shedding around $200 billion following its Q1 results. The stock received downward revisions in target prices across Wall Street. The crucial question now is whether to buy or sell. Personally, I view this as an opportunity to invest in the stock based on its AI-based growth trajectory. I believe it can keep rising.\n\nWeak Revenue Outlook, Higher AI Spend Disappoint Despite Q1 EPS Beat\n\nMeta’s Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $4.32 per share. Also, earnings more than doubled year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.20 per share in the prior-year period. Revenues jumped 27% year-over-year to $36.5 billion, meeting consensus estimates by $36.2 billion.\n\nThe revenue jump was fueled by a 27% rise in Advertising revenue (accounts for 98% of total revenues) to $35.64 billion. However, the Reality Labs division (the division that invests in the Metaverse) continued to report losses, amounting to $3.85 billion for the quarter.\n\nDespite the EPS beat, the stock experienced its largest single-day decline (15%) in over two years. This decline can be attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance and higher-than-expected capital expenditures (CAPEX) forecasts.\n\nThe Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent expects Q2 total revenue to range between $36.5-39 billion, while the consensus was pegged at $38.3 million. CAPEX is expected to increase to $35-40 billion versus the prior guided range of $30-37 billion. Further, expenses are expected to increase and are forecasted to continue to increase through next year. For FY2024, total expenses are predicted to range around $96-99 billion versus the prior guided range of $94-99 billion.\n\nMeta Plans to Invest Heavily in Creating Massive AI Infrastructure\n\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on Meta’s heightened investment plans in AI infrastructure. The company aims to inject billions into the AI space and develop its proprietary AI chips, thereby reducing dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIn terms of newer products, the company also announced that MetaAI, featuring Llama 3 (competing with Microsoft’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini), is poised to become the most efficient AI assistant. This innovation could represent a substantial business opportunity in the coming years, further contributing to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta’s AI investment plans align somewhat with its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the AI domain. While Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported CAPEX of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent $14 billion. Both Google and MSFT plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nHowever, Google and Meta’s shares soared after their recent earnings. On the contrary, Meta’s shares plunged as their capital investments are still not visible in their revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Google and Microsoft’s capital investments in AI are yielding impressive growth in their cloud businesses. However, Meta’s Reality Labs business segment still remains unprofitable, with reported losses exceeding $45 billion since the end of FY2020.\n\nIn essence, while AI spending is translating into direct gains for Google and Microsoft, it’s taking Meta longer to show such returns, turning it into a capital-intensive, cash-sucking endeavor. Therefore, the following question arises: should investors wait and observe or buy the stock at current levels following the recent decline?\n\nIn the long run, Meta’s move to produce its own chips will likely benefit the company significantly by reducing costs associated with expensive GPUs procured from NVDA currently. Additionally, owning its AI infrastructure promises faster and more efficient processing of vast amounts of data for the social media giant.\n\nMeta Stock Is Attractively Valued and Backed by Stable Free Cash Flows\n\nIn terms of its valuation, Meta is attractively valued. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 23.5x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. For the sake of comparison, Microsoft is trading at a P/E of 35x, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at over 50x.\n\nDespite elevated capital expenditures, Meta’s free cash flows remain healthy at $49.5 billion for the past 12 months, or 4.1% of the current market capitalization. It is worth noting that the company started a dividend for the first time in the preceding quarter and continued to buy back shares, implying that management is confident in the company’s fundamentals.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about the stock. Overall, META commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. Meta Platforms stock’s average price target of $530.93 implies 11.73% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Current Stock Price Weakness as a Buying Opportunity\n\nSocial media giant Meta has built a vast user base over time, establishing itself as the clear industry leader. Its steady position among the world’s “Magnificent 7” mega-cap stocks is well-deserved, supported by the continued growth in advertising revenue per user. Notably, Meta’s revenues and margins have been growing impressively, and the integration of AI infrastructure across its portfolio is poised to drive revenues even higher in the coming years.\n\nFor those who missed out on Meta’s remarkable stock rally (second only to NVDA) over the last two years, the current dip presents a buying opportunity, in my view. I personally plan to buy the stock and hold it for the long term.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Given the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, it’s hard to imagine that there are any AI stocks to sell. They’ve all got to be good, no?\n\nThe reality is, like every other industry or segment, there are good and bad stocks to buy and sell. That’s life.\n\nI’ve been tasked with coming up with three AI stocks to sell in May before they crash and burn. An excellent place to start would be the holdings of the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (NYSEARCA:BOTZ), companies that benefit from robotics and AI. The ETF’s website says the global robotics market could be worth $280 billion by 2032, suggesting that it is more focused on robotics than AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNonetheless, the ETF has 43 holdings, and there’s got to be three that don’t pass the sniff test. Here are my picks to sell now.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of my favorite stocks. CEO Jensen Huang has built a business that isn’t afraid to make big bets. AI is the latest bet, and its latest move will probably make Huang the wealthiest person on the planet.\n\nSo, why sell?\n\nAlthough its share price has retreated from its all-time high of $974 hit in March, it is still up 88% year-to-date, 210% over the past year, and over 2,000% in the past five years. Not even Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has come close to its performance since May 2019.\n\nOne sign investors might be fighting Nvidia fatigue is that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller said on May 7 that he would cut his stake in the AI chip maker in 2024.\n\n“We did cut that and a lot of other positions in late March. I just need a break. We’ve had a hell of a run. A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now,” Druckenmiller said while appearing on CNBC.\n\nDruckenmillier likes Nvidia, or he would have sold entirely. His Duquesne Family Office held 617,494 shares as of December 31, 2023. The shares are worth $558 million or 17% of its $3.35 billion portfolio.\n\nCognex (CGNX) Cognex (CGNX) logo displayed on smartphone with pink and blue background behind, symbolizing CGNX stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nCognex (NASDAQ:CGNX) provides machine vision products and solutions for industrial companies. These products include vision systems, barcode readers, 3D vision products, and software.\n\nSuggesting you sell CGNX stock after it reported Q1 2024 results that exceeded Wall Street expectations — revenue was $211 million, 5.2% higher than the analyst estimate, while earnings per share were $0.07, 9.2% higher than the consensus — might seem like a contrarian call, especially since at least four analysts either upgraded or raised their target on Cognex stock, but I’m doing it anyways.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s why.\n\nFirst, let’s go with free cash flow yield. Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $100.3 million [2023 FCF less Q1 2023 FCF plus Q1 2024 FCF] and an enterprise value of $7.75 billion, its FCF yield is 1.3%. I consider anything below 4% to be overvalued territory.\n\nSecondly, its net and operating margins are about half their five-year averages. In Q1 2024, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was 11.9%, 160 basis points worse than Q1 2023, and 70 basis points less than Q4 2023.\n\nLastly, it has no organic growth. Excluding acquisitions, revenues were down 3% in the first quarter, to $211 million. That’s a five-year compound annual growth rate of 4.1% based on Q1 2019 revenue of $173 million.\n\nUp 15% year-to-date, it’s gotten way ahead of itself.\n\nUpstart Holdings (UPST)  Person holding smartphone with logo of U.S. fintech company Upstart Network Inc. (UPST) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) has an AI lending platform that uses machine learning models to evaluate the creditworthiness of loan applicants.\n\n“Our AI marketplace connects consumers with our lending partners. Consumers can access Upstart-powered loans via Upstart.com, through a lender-branded product on our lending partners’ own websites, and through auto dealerships that use our Upstart Auto Retail software,” states page seven of its 2023 10-K.  “Loans issued through our marketplace are retained by our lending partners, purchased by our network of institutional investors, or funded by Upstart’s balance sheet.”\n\nI’ll admit I was an early admirer of Upstart’s business. In November 2021, I got carried away by the excitement around its AI-driven lending platform, suggesting it could go to $500 or $1,000 before too long.\n\nGiven it’s trading around $23, down 40% in 2024, it won’t hit $50 anytime soon, let alone 10x that amount. I was way, way off in my estimation of its potential.\n\nThe reality is Upstart’s platform may be a solution looking for a problem. With no analysts recommending its stock and 10 of 16 rating it a Sell, with a $21.25 target price, there is no room for error.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Robotics Stocks to Bet On for Reliable AI-Powered Returns",
        "content": "Investors seeking reliable AI-powered returns should consider robotics stocks. Many companies are leveraging artificial intelligence to create human-like robots. As discomforting as that truth may be to some, the economic potential therein is massive.\n\nThe numbers behind the opportunity are staggering. Between 2023 and 2030 the artificial intelligence robots market could grow at a compound annual rate of 21.5%. The rule of 72 suggests that an investor with average exposure to the AI robots sector could expect their investments to double in roughly three years.\n\nGenerally speaking, investors are aware that AI and robots, in particular, represent excellent investment opportunities. However, they might not be well aware of the companies and stocks best positioned currently. Let’s take a look at seven such robotics stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) nanotech stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) designs and manufactures robots for the automation of research tasks primarily in laboratory settings. The company has been identifying ways to adapt artificial intelligence within its robots for years.\n\nIts recent collaboration with Multiply Labs is a good example. The company produces advanced cell therapy instruments. TMO lent its AI expertise to the company, resulting in more fully automated cell therapy manufacturing.\n\nThe benefits of the collaboration are clear and apply broadly to the application of AI to robotics. Those benefits include enhanced throughput and reduced labor costs. While the application of AI is currently focused on data centers and computing, it is clear the robotics opportunity is also massive.\n\nTMO is also a particularly stable stock, which holds appeal now for its defensive nature. The shares benefit from a beta of 0.80. That implies they may hold up better in any upcoming downturn.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has had a very difficult year, which looks to have changed course in the last two weeks. A lot of the turnaround has to do with improving conditions in China and the news that the firm will launch a cheap EV model in 2025.\n\nThose are clearly the most potent catalysts any investor should consider when investing in Tesla. The company is first and foremost an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer. However, beyond that, Tesla is notable in that it is developing AI robots.\n\nTesla continues to develop its humanoid Optimus robots. Although the project receives relatively less coverage, given Tesla is an EV company, it remains impressive. Elon Musk recently went on record stating the company could begin selling its Optimus robots as early as the end of next year. Musk believes the robots could perform warehouse tasks by the end of this year. Meanwhile, firms, including BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), plan to use humanoid robots in their manufacturing operations soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) will continue to be one of the best AI robotics stocks for investors to consider. The company is best known for its da Vinci Surgical System. That system is a major driver of growth and one that applies artificial intelligence.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is a strong investment precisely because of the da Vinci Surgical System. On a worldwide basis, procedural volume increased by 16% during the first quarter. As of March 31, there are 8,887 da Vinci systems installed globally. That represents a 14% increase from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRevenue increased by 11% during that timeframe, with earnings rising by 51%. Intuitive Surgical had 15 patents related to artificial intelligence during the 4th quarter of 2023. Those cover a variety of applications, but generally, all leverage machine learning to improve surgery at the point of delivery.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is the best robotic surgery stock for investors overall.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeradyne (NASDAQ:TER) is a diversified firm operating in both the semiconductor and robotics industries. The company sells chip-testing products. While Teradyne is primarily a semiconductor firm, it is also notable for its efforts in robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nEvidence of that assertion can be found in the recent news that the company will collaborate with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to bring AI capabilities to the automation process. Teradyne’s robotics business includes several robotics firms under its corporate umbrella.\n\nFor one, Universal Robots demonstrated an autonomous inspection solution at Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference, better known as Nvidia GTC.\n\nTeradyne’s robotics arm accounted for $88 million of the firm’s $600 million in sales during the first quarter. As mentioned above, Teradyne is primarily a semiconductor testing firm. That segment accounted for $412 million in revenues during the period. Overall, it was a strong quarter for Teradyne, with results besting expectations, driven by artificial intelligence applications.\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is the world’s largest pure-play industrial automation and digital transformation firm, according to its website. It should be no surprise that its stock is one of the better-known ways to invest in the combination of robotics and AI.\n\nIn my mind, there are two primary reasons why investors should pay particular attention to Rockwell Automation. One is that Rockwell Automation is heavily leveraged in North America. In fact, 58% of the company’s revenues are attributable to the North American market. That’s particularly important because the North American region has dominated artificial intelligence early on. Second, Intelligent Devices accounted for $4.1 billion of the firm’s $9.1 billion in revenues in its 2023 fiscal year.\n\nRockwell Automation is looking to further the application of AI within its business. It recently decided to increase the scale and scope of AI by collaborating with Nvidia to accelerate next-generation industrial architecture. ROK stock is one of the first places to go for investors who believe the application of AI to robots is the future.\n\nDeere & Company (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Company (NYSE:DE) is a firm and stock that has been heavily invested in AI autonomy for several years. It was back in 2022 that the company announced its autonomous 8R tractor. By that point, roughly 50 such autonomous tractors comprised its global fleet.\n\nBy early 2024 Deere & Company’s autonomous tractors were operating across farms in seven states within the U.S. The company has a goal stating every piece of equipment that touches corn or soy is to be fully autonomous within the next six years.\n\nDeere is heavily leveraging computer vision and machine learning, with the goal of fully automated farming by 2030. It is also using AI to reduce the amount of herbicide needed to keep crops healthy.\n\nThe company insists its efforts to leverage AI are not done, with the goal of reducing the agricultural labor force. Instead, Deere & Company hopes to allow farmers to opportunity to do more at once by leveraging automation and AI. It will certainly be necessary as the world’s growing population will demand greater and greater agricultural output in the coming decades.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is best known for its GPU chips and, more recently, its application to all things AI, data centers and machine learning. Those chips have proven to be the most capable for those applications. That dominance also extends to the robotics realm, where Nvidia is also making significant strides.\n\nBack in mid-March, Nvidia announced its project Groot Foundational Model for Humanoid Robots. That announcement also included updates to the company’s Isaac robotics platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia also unveiled a new computer named Jetson Thor to be leveraged for developing humanoid robots. It’s clear that Nvidia is much more than an AI chip maker dedicated to cloud computing and data center applications. The company is clearly putting substantial resources into the robotics opportunity and deserves investor attention for that fact as well.\n\nNvidia is so much more than that. Investors who care to dig deeper will find that Nvidia’s AI prowess is incredibly deep and wide.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bull runs can lead to outsized gains for patient investors. Some stocks perform better than others, leaving the rest of the market in dust. Growth-oriented investors usually aren’t shy about taking more risk in exchange for a higher potential upside. However, that doesn’t mean investors should become reckless. Investors should focus on corporations that offer a good mix of competitive moat, financial growth and rising profit margins. These three growth stocks for the next Nasdaq bull run that check each box and can deliver solid returns for long-term investors.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a profitable educational tech company that is only starting to expand its profit margins. Net profit margins for Q4 2023 came in at 8% due to resounding financial and user growth. The company reported $151.0 million in total revenue for the quarter. That’s a 45% year-over-year increase.\n\nNet income was up even more. The company reported a net loss of $13.9 million in Q4 2022. Meanwhile, it turned a $12.1 million profit in Q4 2023. The big turnaround reflects Duolingo’s ability to accelerate profit margin expansion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts users should continue to show strong interest in the trend. Daily active users came to 26.9 million, up by 65% year-over-year. The company also reported a 46% year-over-year increase in monthly active users to reach 88.4 million MAUs.\n\nShares are up by 90% over the past year. The app gamifies learning new languages and has expanded into additional subjects like math and music. As more people learn online, Duolingo should continue to benefit.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a top-tier cybersecurity firm that looks poised to take market share from its competitors in the upcoming quarters. The cybersecurity giant reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth and surging profits in Q4 FY24.\n\nMost of the company’s revenue is recurring, and the tally stood at $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue to wrap up fiscal 2024. Crowdstrike also reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million net loss in the same period last year. The stock is up by 373% over the past five years and is already off to a strong start with a 23% year-to-date gain.\n\nWall Street analysts believe the cybersecurity stock has more room to climb. The average price target suggests a 31% upside. The highest price target of $435 per share indicates shares can rally by an additional 43% from current levels. Wall Street is bullish on this stock and has given it a “Strong Buy” rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a top beneficiary of the AI boom. The company’s GPU chips lead the industry and are up by 78% year-to-date. However, the stock has been quiet since the start of March and has traded flat since then.\n\nThe company’s May 22 earnings will change that. Nvidia stock will either soar or enter a correction. An in-between scenario seems unlikely, but Wall Street analysts are optimistic about an upswing. The average price target suggests a 17% upside. It’s rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.\n\nNvidia reported a blowout earnings report in Q4 FY24. Revenue increased by 265% year-over-year while net income surged by 769% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter growth has been decelerating. Q4 FY24 revenue only marked a 22% sequential improvement. The stock trades at 34 forward P/E and 1.11 PEG ratios.  The stock looks like it has a good valuation, assuming the firm maintains high financial growth for another year.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have bid up quite a bit over the past year as investors have rushed to bet on the revolutionary new technology. Generative AI remains a profound technology today, as it did during the early days of the AI-fuelled stock rally. Still, AI is one of those technologies that stand to get exponentially better over time. And the technology is improving, even if shares of the top innovators begin going sideways or lower.\n\nIt wasn’t too long before we were all amazed by ChatGPT 4. Nowadays, many of us may have taken the large language model (LLM) for granted. It’s still a powerful technology, but the honeymoon period seems to have long faded.\n\nMany of us are ready for the GPT-5 or OpenAI’s text-to-video generator Sora. Others have jumped ship to other LLM offerings on the market, some of which may outperform GPT-4 on certain criteria. As the momentum behind AI stocks cools and ChatGPT hype fades further, you may get a second chance to pick up shares of undervalued AI stocks that could gain substantially in the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been consolidating over the past few months as investors ponder whether the firm has another blockbuster earnings blowout up its sleeves. Undoubtedly, the last quarter will be tough to top as the GPU juggernaut announces its results on May 22, 2024, at the market’s close.\n\nStill, demand for top AI hardware is not slowing down. However, as an NVDA stockholder in the weeks leading up to earnings, one can’t help but feel jittery. At just 37.45 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I still view NVDA stock as a pretty good deal despite high expectations.\n\nYou’re getting a world-class AI chip maker at a multiple that I don’t consider out of this world. Pending a devastating, unforeseen downward shift in chip demand, I think NVDA shareholders have plenty of reason to hang in for the ride. Blackwell B200 GPUs could power the stock in the near future, and at a later date, Nvidia will likely have a newer chip that blows Blackwell out of the water.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) doesn’t get enough credit for its AI innovations. With the stock still stuck in a “hangover” after Informatica (NYSE:INFA) acquisition talks dissipated two weeks ago, I think investors are getting a pretty solid entry point at just shy of $280 per share, down around 12% from its March peak. Perhaps the huge negative reaction in CRM stock caused a swift end to deal hopes. In any case, Salesforce has a pretty good seat in the AI show and one industry rivals could envy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the future, customer relationship management will largely depend on advanced AI copilots. With distinct advantages in AI for its niche, Salesforce is likely to come out on top as it widens its moat and gains further share on rivals. Additionally, the more AI Salesforce attaches to its current offerings, the more value it’s likely to produce for customers and the more willing they will be to pay up.\n\nAt 28.5 times forward P/E, Salesforce stands out as an undervalued AI stock that can more than keep up with the AI prowess of multi-trillion-dollar tech stars.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock had its moment in the AI sunshine, helping it hit more than decade-long highs. Nowadays, it’s on the retreat as investors cool on the firm following a tough revenue miss and news of its $6.4 billion HashiCorp acquisition, even in light of its AI prospects.\n\nNow down just over 11% from its recent March peak, shares seem more like a worthy bargain.\n\nAs impressive as Watsonx generative AI has been, the technology may still be a few years away from taking growth into overdrive. There’s no doubt that IBM has been taking steps to return to growth after many years of lackluster moves in the stock. AI will play a huge part in its comeback.\n\nThough less timely than some of its AI-savvy peers, IBM still stands out as a potential long-term winner from the rise of the technology. At 16.5 times forward P/E, IBM stock stands out as an option for value investors seeking exposure to the booming field of AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Salesforce The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Buy Immediately, According to AI",
        "content": "In the late 1970s, Louis Navellier – then a college student, now a senior analyst at InvestorPlace – accidentally beat the market. By running financial data through a Wells Fargo mainframe computer (an enormous privilege at the time!), he came across a model that beat the S&P 500 by a considerable margin.\n\nSince then, he’s developed his system into Portfolio Grader, a quantitative stock-picking system that has trounced the market. It’s found picks like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at $6… Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at under $1…\n\nIn fact, every dollar invested in Louis’s A-graded stocks in 1998 would have risen fiftyfold by 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese quantitative systems are generally focused on finding stocks for the long run. We’re not asking these systems to predict what’s going to happen next week… let alone the next 24 hours.\n\nAnd that matters. Especially if you’re an options trader… active investor… or even a long-term buyer seeking a better entry price. In these cases, it’s essential to know when stocks will rise (and not just which ones).\n\nThat’s where AI trading systems like TradeSmith’s Predictive Alpha come in. These systems analyze hundreds of technical aspects, scouring share prices and volume metrics for “clues” of trader intent. (If you’re a $10 billion fund selling $100 million of stock in a company that only has $50 million of average turnover a day… you’re going to influence prices no matter what.)\n\nThat’s why I’m so excited this week to introduce Jonathan Rose, a veteran trader who has mastered the ins and outs of these types of trades. In his latest Masters in Trading presentation, he outlines the strategies, indicators, and other market clues he uses to notch returns of 197%… 317%… even 1,147% in 30 days or less.\n\nIn the meantime, I’d like to leave you with five tactical picks from TradeSmith’s Predictive Alpha system that our writers at InvestorPlace.com – our free news and analysis site – also have highlighted this week.\n\nThese are five companies we expect will do well over the next 30 days, which makes them the ideal “buy the dip” stocks for a recovering market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nTradeSmith’s Predictive Alpha ranks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as its top pick this week, projecting a 3.6% return over the next 30 days. (That translates to a 52% annualized rate thanks to compounding). The quantitative system sees Nvidia’s recent 15% selloff as overdone.\n\nIt’s admittedly been difficult for investors to stomach Nvidia’s sky-high prices. Even though my own models project that shares could be worth $1,600 by 2027, the company’s eyewatering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios make it seem like an enormous bet on a future that may never arrive.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, Nvidia’s recent pullback now puts prices back into more “normal” territory. Shares now trade at 25 times 2026 earnings – not far from the average S&P 500 firm. And Ian Cooper writes at InvestorPlace.com that these lower prices present a compelling buying opportunity:\n\nNvidia could see even more upside with the AI and metaverse boom. After climbing to a high of $967.66, it’s now back to $830.41. This weakness could be a long-term opportunity. From that last traded price, I’d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.\n\nStrong results from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are also making a bullish case. Last Thursday, the smartphone chipmaker announced that earnings had surged 37% to $2.3 billion, driven by record automotive revenues and strong AI demand. This comes as a stark contrast to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, which had previously announced worse-than-expected Q1 results.\n\nThat tells us that the “AI chip slowdown” seen by some Nvidia rivals are company-specific issues. Nvidia itself continues to score a top A grade in Louis’s Portfolio Grader, and rising analyst earnings estimates suggests that a near-term recovery will soon be underway.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPredictive Alpha similarly rates Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as a perfect “buy-the-dip” stock. The system forecasts a 3.1% upside over the next month.\n\nIn short, investors have become increasingly pessimistic about how much Meta will have to invest in data centers and AI – capital-intensive projects that will yield few immediate results. Wall Street analysts have quietly trimmed their target prices by $5 since last month.\n\nHowever, Meta is now seeing a surge in its core advertising business, with ad volume growth outpacing user growth almost threefold. As Yiannis Zourmpanos puts it in an article on InvestorPlace.com:\n\nA 6% increase in the average price per ad YOY suggests that Meta’s advertising platform is now more efficiently monetized…\n\nLooking forward, Meta will continue to expand its income by investing in data analytics, ad targeting skills, and advertising technologies. Therefore, ad impressions and average ad pricing will continue to rise due to the company’s emphasis on increasing user engagement, growing the ad inventory, and boosting ad relevancy.\n\nElection years are typically excellent periods for advertisers, and we’re seeing old patterns play out at Meta Platforms.\n\nEven better, Meta’s stock currently trades for just 22 times forward earnings, making it one of the cheapest “Magnificent Seven” stock by that metric. Though Wall Street might seem bearish about Meta’s near-term prospects, our quant systems suggest the selloff has now gone too far.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn April, InvestorPlace.com’s Marc Guberti highlighted Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) as a stock to buy whenever the market falters:\n\nRising profit margins and a solid moat are strengthening the company’s long-term prospects. Analysts are bullish on the stock and rated it as a “Strong Buy.” The average price target suggests an 11% upside.\n\nEssentially, Intuit is an “evergreen” stock that tends to make money in both good times and bad. Over the past three recessions, Intuit saw revenues rise double digits as consumers traded down for cheaper online accounting services. And during good times, Intuit also does well as small businesses migrate from pen-and-paper bookkeeping to digitized services like QuickBooks.\n\nA recent selloff in tech stocks now provides us with that market “falter” we’ve been waiting for. Shares of Intuit have now fallen 8% from their peak, which puts it near the top of Predictive Alpha’s list. The quantitative stock-picking system believes shares will recover 3.1% over the next 30 days.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce strong results on May 23. The IRS only began accepting returns on Jan. 29 this year, and so much of Intuit’s early season tax business will be pushed into its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expect revenues to rise 9% to $6.6 billion, and for earnings per share to surge 10% to $9.36. These are phenomenal growth rates for a mature blue-chip firm.\n\nIntuit also earns a high score in both Portfolio Grader (where it scores a “B”), signaling long-term gains to come. The firm is highly profitable and fast-growing, and its recent decline in short interest suggests that bears are beginning to throw in the towel. That makes the tax software firm a rarity: a stock that’s attractive to both short- and long-term investors.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Tuesday, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and a host of other large brands warned that consumers were “starting to crack.” Rising inflation and dwindling savings have begun to impact demand. Starbucks (NYSE:SBUX) also has felt the pinch – same-store-sales declined 3% in Q2.\n\nThat perhaps makes Target (NYSE:TGT) the strangest short-term pick by Predictive Alpha this week. Shares of the retailer are expected to rise 3.1% over the next 30 days, bucking a broader trend of negative consumer news.\n\nThere are several reasons for optimism. As Josh Enomoto notes at InvestorPlace.com, Target is more rock-solid than most realize:\n\nA big-box retailer, Target may face pressure amid the broader economic anxieties. However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco.\n\nSecond, Target is also better shielded from the yo-yo demand that has put firms like Starbucks on the defensive. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target, and as the saying goes, “we’ve all got to eat.”\n\nFinally, InvestorPlace.com’s Will Ashworth writes that Target is one of the few firms that has added significant headcount over the past five years and maintained strong returns on invested capital. It’s a faster-growing firm than most realize, and Ashworth previously recommended shares as a bargain buy when TGT traded at around $126.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) A hand holds up the Airbnb (ABNB) logo outside a home in Estonia.\n\nSource: AlesiaKan / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, Predictive Alpha highlights Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) this week for its 3% expected return over the next 30 days, a 43% annualized rate of return.\n\nShares of Airbnb are only slightly higher today than when it first went public in 2020. The novelty of home rentals has worn off, and the firm has only managed to meet sky-high IPO expectations, not exceed them.\n\nHowever, this flattish long-term performance masks some incredible moves in Airbnb’s stock. In April 2022, a delayed Covid-19 exit sent shares plummeting 40%. A recovery in tech stocks and consumer demand has since reversed that loss.\n\nJeremy Flint, as he writes at InvestorPlace.com, now believes a bookings boom is set to put Airbnb back on a faster track of growth:\n\nAirbnb’s user base is returning to the platform’s original concept of offering spare space as a budget-friendly alternative to hotels. Despite facing significant challenges, such as a $10 million fine for misleading international customers by listing prices in USD rather than local currencies, Airbnb’s market dominance remains unchallenged…\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Airbnb disclosed nearly a 17% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 15% rise in gross booking value. Spurred by the holiday travel surge, this growth is expected to continue as we move into the spring and summer travel seasons.\n\nSince September, Airbnb has seen the number of shares sold short decline from 34.8 million to just 16.6 million – a 52% drop.\n\nStocks for the Long Short Run\n\nIn 1994, economist Jeremy Siegel published Stocks for the Long Run, an investment tome that was often referred to as “the buy and hold Bible.” By investing in the U.S. stock market and holding on for extended periods, even ordinary investors could turn small investments into vast fortunes.\n\nHowever, critics have since pointed out that not every investor has a 40-plus year investment horizon. Some might not even have five years. And the incredible run that U.S. stock markets saw in the 20th century might fail to repeat in modern times. America, after all, saw its economy move from a middling one to the world’s greatest superpower during this period. (Buy-and-hold investors in Turkey, Argentina, and China have done far worse).\n\nThat means investing in the 21st century will need some combination of long-term investing paired with tactical trading. Nvidia might be a phenomenal long-term stock… but is $700 a good entry price? $800? $1,000?\n\nThat’s where Jonathan Rose’s Masters in Trading Summit comes in. In this video event, he shares how to analyze short-term market moves and detect signals that long-term stock-picking algorithms might otherwise miss. And he’s giving this presentation away for free to InvestorPlace.com readers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held no positions in stocks mentioned in this article.

The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%.\r\n\r\nThe year-over-year increase was driven by continued strength in travel demand and the timing of the Easter holiday. Continuous improvement in Nights and Experiences Booked acted as a tailwind.\r\n\r\nGrowing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum across non-urban areas and increased demand for urban and cross-border travel, remained a positive. A modest increase in Average Daily Rate was a plus.\r\n\r\nThese factors aided growth in the company’s Gross Booking Value (GBV) in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, a solid momentum in Airbnb app downloads contributed well.\n\nAirbnb, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.76 billion.\r\n\r\nAirbnb expects revenues to benefit from robust travel demand. However, the company expects revenue growth to face a significant sequential headwind due to the timing of the Easter holiday and the impact of forex rate changes.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decrease year over year.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, the company expects an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 35%.\n\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Airbnb has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Akoustis Technologies AKTS, NVIDIA NVDA and Intrusion INTZ, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2, at present.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Shares of Arm Holdings fell 8% in premarket trading on Thursday as the chip designer's downbeat annual revenue forecast cooled some of the enthusiasm around the stock following its AI-powered jump in recent months.\n\nBets that Arm will benefit from a surge in AI computing have doubled the chipmaker's share price since its initial public offer last September, giving it a market value of about $110 billion.\n\n\"This is a typical case of ARM not being able to live up to heightened expectations,\" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, adding that Arm's business is overtly reliant on the smartphone market, which has recently shown slower growth.\n\nUK-based Arm, which earns by licensing its chip designs and through royalties, has been expanding into the data center market where operators are looking to build their own chips to power new AI models and reduce their reliance on dominant supplier Nvidia.\n\n\"AI demand (for Arm's technology) will take some time to grow into the revenue mix to absorb that weakness (from the smartphone market),\" said Tejas Dessai, a research analyst at Global X ETFs.\n\nThe UK chip designer said it was expecting full-year revenue between $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion, the midpoint for which fell slightly below the consensus estimate of $3.99 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nIts revenue in the March quarter and the forecast for the current quarter, however, came in above expectations.\n\nAt least two analysts cut their price target on Arm, whose chip designs power nearly every smartphone in the world.\n\nArm shares trade at 64.68 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, significantly higher than the industry median of 19.95, according to LSEG data.\n\nShares of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices fell about 1% each in premarket trading on Thursday.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: This Incredibly Cheap Semiconductor Stock Could Become the Next Nvidia",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on a tear on the stock market over the past year and a half, which is not surprising -- the company has been delivering phenomenal earnings and revenue growth thanks to the booming demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nNvidia commands a dominant position in the AI chip market with a market share of more than 90%. It is leagues ahead of rivals such as Intel and AMD, which are still looking to cut their teeth in this market. For example, Nvidia is expected to sell $87 billion worth of AI chips this year. AMD and Intel, meanwhile, are expecting to generate $4 billion and $500 million, respectively, from AI chip sales this year.\n\nNvidia is clearly the go-to chipmaker for companies that are looking to train and deploy AI models, as its share of this market illustrates. The stock market has rewarded the company's dominance handsomely, which is evident from the 507% jump in its share price since the beginning of 2023. This stunning rally has brought Nvidia's trailing earnings multiple to 74, which is quite rich if you consider that the Nasdaq-100 index has an earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\n\nThere is a solid chance that Nvidia can justify this expensive multiple with tremendous growth going forward. But there is an alternative for investors who are looking for a company that could replicate Nvidia's AI-driven success in a different market and is trading at an attractive valuation right now -- Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nLet's look at the reasons why this chipmaker has the potential of becoming the next Nvidia.\n\nQualcomm's position in the smartphone market is set to unlock a massive opportunity\n\nQualcomm is the second-largest manufacturer of application processors used in smartphones. The company controlled 28% of this market at the end of 2023, trailing the top-ranked manufacturer MediaTek by 5 percentage points.\n\nOne may argue that Qualcomm isn't as dominant as Nvidia in its field. However, it wouldn't be surprising to see Qualcomm eventually capture a bigger share of the smartphone processor market thanks to the proliferation of AI-enabled smartphones. On its May earnings conference call when management was discussing the company's fiscal 2024 second-quarter results (for the three months ended March 24), CEO Cristiano Amon said:\n\nIn premium and high-tier smartphones, our Snapdragon mobile platforms continue to set the bar for performance and on-device gen AI capabilities. Recently launched flagship Android devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore specifically, Qualcomm's revenue from chip sales to Chinese smartphone customers increased more than 40% year over year in the first half of the current fiscal year. This impressive year-over-year increase in Chinese revenue indicates that Qualcomm is making solid headway in a country where MediaTek is the leading player, and is aiming to corner 30% of the flagship smartphone market.\n\nQualcomm is looking to build upon its growing prominence in the Chinese smartphone market by bringing on-device AI capabilities \"to a broader range of flagship and high-tier smartphones with the new Snapdragon 8S Gen3 and Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms, launching in the second half of 2024.\"\n\nAll this explains why Qualcomm is expecting its growth to accelerate from the current quarter. The company delivered a revenue increase of just 1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to $9.4 billion. It is forecasting $9.2 billion in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a 9% jump over the same period last year.\n\nThe company is expecting its earnings to grow at a faster pace of 20% year over year to $2.25 per share in the current quarter. Wall Street would have settled for $2.18 per share in earnings on $9.06 billion in revenue from Qualcomm, but the company is set to go past those expectations thanks to the growing demand for AI-powered smartphones and its improving influence in markets such as China.\n\nThat's not surprising, as the company's AI-capable smartphone chips are being deployed by leading smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). Qualcomm is looking to push the envelope in this space by focusing on bringing AI capabilities into mid-range smartphones as well.\n\nIn all, Qualcomm is setting itself up to make the most of the bustling market for generative AI smartphones, shipments of which are expected to grow at an eye-popping compound annual growth rate of 65% between 2024 and 2027, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nThe stock's valuation makes it a no-brainer buy\n\nThe generative AI smartphone market is currently in its early phases of growth. Counterpoint estimates that these devices will account for 11% of the overall smartphone market in 2024, and then grow to 43% of the market in 2027. Even then, there will be a lot of room for growth in sales of generative AI smartphones as more companies bring these devices to the market.\n\nSo Qualcomm is doing the right thing by bolstering its portfolio of AI-focused smartphone chips, and it is making nice headway in this market, with marquee customers such as Samsung. As a result, there is a good chance of Qualcomm becoming a bigger player in the smartphone chips market and replicating the success that Nvidia has seen in the AI chips market.\n\nThat's why investors would do well to buy Qualcomm at its current valuation. The stock sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 24, which is well below the multiples that Nvidia and the broader Nasdaq-100 index command. The forward earnings multiple is also attractive at 19. Moreover, as the following chart shows, analysts have been raising their earnings growth expectations from Qualcomm. QCOM EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAll this indicates that Qualcomm is capable of delivering stronger growth in the coming years thanks to lucrative catalysts such as the AI smartphone market, where the company is a key player. That's why investors looking for the next Nvidia should consider buying Qualcomm before this semiconductor stock steps on the gas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Sell in May Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "The semiconductor market has reached a tipping point, which is why savvy investors should be looking for semiconductor stocks to sell at the moment. Semiconductor stocks have been on a stellar run over the past 2 years, thanks to the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G and data centers. However, the outlook of the industry does not look as promising going forward.\n\nDespite reaching a record $595.7 billion in revenue in 2022, the semiconductor market experienced declines across all four quarters of 2023. Moreover, due to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, some U.S. companies are at high risk of disruption due to their geographic concentration in China.\n\nFurthermore, recent macroeconomic concerns, including inflation, high interest rates, and slowing global demand, have cast a shadow over the semiconductor sector. The Federal Reserve’s tightening policy and emerging economic headwinds could make the upcoming months challenging for chip stocks. Here are three semiconductor stocks to consider selling this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a diversified portfolio that spans both semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. However, the shifting market dynamics and geopolitical tensions pose headwinds for the company.\n\nChina accounts for a significant portion of Broadcom’s revenue. The country was responsible for around $11.53 billion of revenue in 2023, making it AVGO’s largest geographic market. With the U.S.-China trade tensions heating up, Broadcom is exposed to regulatory risks. Any restrictions on semiconductor sales could severely impact the company’s bottom line.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom’s legacy software businesses, CA Technologies and Symantec, face headwinds. CA Technologies is entrenched in the declining mainframe market, while Symantec’s traditional antivirus solutions are being eclipsed by cloud-native competitors like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nThe company’s valuation multiples far exceed the semiconductor industry average. Much of Broadcom’s valuation is driven by expectations around its AI business. If AI-driven growth slows down, it can cause a significant downside in the stock price.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is known for its historical dominance in the CPU market. However, in recent years, the company has faced significant challenges, leading to a sharp decline in its stock price. Although the company posted revenues and earnings per share above analyst expectations, the company’s weak guidance for the upcoming quarter sent Intel shares tumbling. The company’s stock has fallen 35% since the start of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel Foundry has reported a deal pipeline exceeding $15 billion. However, profitability remains a distant goal for the company. Intel expects Intel Foundry to remain unprofitable until at least the midpoint of this decade. In addition, Intel faces competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), which claims its N3P process will outperform Intel’s 18A node.\n\nChina represents Intel’s largest market, accounting for 27% of the company’s total revenues. However, recent regulatory changes have highlighted Intel’s heightened exposure to geopolitical risks. The Chinese government has urged state-backed organizations to reduce their reliance on foreign chips. This will have a direct impact on Intel’s market share.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn recent years, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a serious contender in the semiconductor industry. However, it faces stiff competition from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which continues to dominate this space. Despite moderately positive earnings surprises, AMD’s stock has faced selling pressure of late. The stock has fallen 23% since the start of March this year.\n\nNvidia recently announced its next-generation Blackwell GPUs, coupled with advanced AI software offerings. This could pose a significant threat to AMD’s market share. Although AMD’s MI300 AI accelerator has made impressive gains, analysts remain cautious about its ability to compete effectively with Nvidia’s upcoming products.\n\nWhile AMD has raised its FY2024 data center GPU revenue guidance from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, this pales in comparison to Nvidia’s $47.5 billion in data center revenues in FY2024.\n\nWith the stock currently trading at a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation, investors should carefully assess the risk/reward of having money invested in AMD stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Can Triple in the Next 24 Months",
        "content": "Blue-chip stocks are generally associated with slow and steady returns. However, there can be exceptions when blue-chip stocks move like growth stocks.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good example, with the stock having surged by 217% in the last 12 months. The focus of this column is on similar blue-chip stocks set to triple in the next 24 months.\n\nI believe there are two key reasons for ballistic returns in blue-chip stocks in quick time. First, the stocks are trading at a deep valuation gap due to temporary headwinds. When these headwinds wane, the stock surges. Further, there is a big addressable market for a particular product or service that changes the entire growth outlook for the company. The rally in Nvidia was largely driven by the growth potential of AI.\n\nWith this overview, let’s talk about seven blue-chip stocks set to triple in quick time with a focus on the industry or business catalyst.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is a relatively new listing that holds immense potential. After listing at $51 in September 2023, ARM stock surged to highs of $164 in February. A meaningful correction has followed, and ARM stock trades at $108. In my view, this is a golden opportunity to accumulate.\n\nAs an overview, Arm Holdings is a developer and licensor of central processing unit products and related technologies. The company claims its CPUs have enabled advanced computing in over 99% of the world’s smartphones.\n\nFor Q3 2023, Arm reported 14% year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenue to $824 million. That was the company’s highest-ever quarterly revenue, with growth driven by license as well as royalty revenue upside. Further, Arm Holdings is on track to report annual free cash flows of more than $1 billion.\n\nAn important point to note is that Arm has moved away from general-purpose CPUs to products catering to specific industries. The company offers AI-enabled CPUs for mobile, consumer electronics, IoT, automobile and cloud & networking. Therefore, the addressable market is significant, and royalty revenue will continue to swell. With the stock relatively undiscovered, it’s a good time for exposure.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocks\n\nSource: Alexander Limbach / Shutterstock\n\nI believe gold mining stocks are positioned to surge higher, and Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is among the undervalued names to consider. My view is underscored by the point that GOLD stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 15.8.\n\nAn important point to note is that gold is already trading above $2,300 an ounce. Further, analysts expect the precious metal to touch $2,600 an ounce. If this scenario holds true, gold mining stocks will likely skyrocket on the back of higher realized sales prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2023, Barrick reported adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow of $5.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. If gold trades above $2,500 an ounce, it’s likely OCF will be more than $4.5 billion.\n\nThat will translate into higher dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, credit metrics will improve, and GOLD stock will be re-rated. It’s, therefore, a good time to buy the stock before the big rally from a valuation gap.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s said that the best time to buy quality ideas is when sentiments are bearish. That holds true for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which has a reputation for making big comebacks. Year-to-date, TSLA stock has declined by almost 30%. In my view, the negatives of competition and macroeconomic headwinds are discounted in the stock.\n\nIn May 2023, Elon Musk indicated that the company is working on two new products. These have the potential for combined sales of five million cars annually. The markets might be in for some surprises in the coming quarters as more is revealed on these products.\n\nElon Musk also indicated that higher interest rates have been impacting sales growth. With multiple rate cuts likely in the next 12 to 18 months, I expect deliveries growth to accelerate.\n\nAnother point worth mentioning is that Tesla has been looking to build a $25,000 car. Low-price cars can have a big impact on sales in emerging markets like Southeast Asia and India. With plenty of surprises likely, TSLA stock can surge from oversold levels.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong asset classes, industrial commodities are the most undervalued. Within the industrial commodity space, Vale (NYSE:VALE) is trading at a deep valuation gap. To put things into perspective, VALE stock has delivered capital gains of 10% in the last five years. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 6, the stock seems poised for a big breakout rally.\n\nAn important point to note is that with the possibility of rate cuts, I expect industrial commodities to surge. That will be positive for Vale, and it’s worth noting that iron ore has already been trending higher.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Vale reported the highest iron ore production since 2019. For the quarter, copper and nickel production growth was also robust.\n\nOn the financial front, Vale reported free cash flow of $2 billion for the quarter. If commodities trend higher, the company is positioned to report an annual FCF close to $10 billion. That will ensure dividends sustain. Additionally, the balance sheet will likely remain strong, even after factoring in the potential payment for the dam disaster.\n\nAT&T (T) Image of a person holding their smartphone\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) is another depressed stock that might be poised for a big breakout rally. After remaining sideways for the last 12 months, T stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.7. Further, the stock offers a robust dividend yield of 6.5%. Considering financial and business metrics, the stock seems to be trading at a deep valuation gap.\n\nThe first positive to note is that the company’s operational trend has been encouraging. That includes growth in subscribers coupled with upside in average revenue per user. Between 2018 and 2023, AT&T has invested more than $140 billion in its U.S. wireless and wireline networks. These investments will continue to ensure the company’s operational trend remains positive.\n\nThe second important point to note is that AT&T has guided for free cash flow of $17 to $18 billion for 2024. Healthy FCF will ensure dividends and deleveraging. AT&T is on track to achieve its leverage target, and as credit metrics improve, T stock will likely trend higher.\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPanasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stock has been depressed, and the reason is because of negative sentiments for the EV sector. I, however, see this as an opportunity to accumulate. With PCRFY stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.3, the upside can be significant once industry sentiment reverses.\n\nOne catalyst for a change in sentiment is potential rate cuts. Expansionary monetary policies will likely support accelerated growth for the EV sector. As one of the largest manufacturers of EV batteries, Panasonic is positioned to benefit.\n\nOf course, that’s not the only reason to be bullish. Panasonic has ambitious capacity expansion plans through 2031. That will translate into steady revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion. At the same time, the company is focused on innovation. It partnered with Sila Nanotechnologies to purchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries. This will likely help boost the energy density of batteries by 25%.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Warren Buffett is buying a stock from a cyclical industry, it’s not worth ignoring. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has, therefore, been in the limelight this past year. However, with oil remaining subdued, OXY stock has remained largely sideways. I see that as a good opportunity to accumulate before the energy stock surges higher.\n\nAmong the positives, Occidental reported an operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for Q1 2024. If oil trends higher after rate cuts, the annual OCF potential will likely be close to $10 billion. That positions Occidental for dividends, share repurchases and deleveraging. It’s worth noting that Occidental regained its investment grade rating last year. Those positive factors are yet to be discounted in the stock.\n\nFrom an asset perspective, the company’s proved reserves increased to four billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2023. Last year, the reserve replacement ratio was 137%. A quality asset base with an attractive break-even ensures long-term cash flow visibility.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 3 Small-Cap Stocks Offer Up to 557% Upside, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Since the page turned to 2023 a little over 16 months ago, the bulls have been running wild on Wall Street. Professional and everyday investors have flocked to high-growth, innovation-driven businesses, and have been particularly enamored with Wall Street's next-big-thing investment trend: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith AI and machine learning, software and systems are given the ability to learn over time without human intervention. Being able to evolve and become more proficient at assigned tasks gives AI wide-ranging utility and multitrillion-dollar long-term potential. It's precisely why investors have piled into semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and sent its market cap higher by nearly $1.9 trillion since 2023 began. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's upside may be limited as headwinds build\n\nA quick review of Nvidia's headline growth figures demonstrates why investors can't seem to get enough of this stock.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, which came to a close on January 28, Nvidia reported total sales growth of 126%, with Data Center revenue climbing by a scorching-hot 217%. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become staples in AI-accelerated data centers, and are the go-to for businesses aiming to train large language models and run generative AI solutions on their cloud-based platforms.\n\nBut even with things going swimmingly for Nvidia, the high-water price target among Wall Street analysts is $1,400 from Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt. This implies Nvidia's peak upside over the next year is 58%, based on where the company's shares ended on May 3.\n\nDespite this lofty price target, it's possible the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement is firmly in a bubble. Every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has endured a bubble during its early stages of expansion, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has competition coming at it from all angles. External competitors are bringing newly designed AI-GPUs to market to compete directly with Nvidia's H100 chip. Meanwhile, Nvidia's top four customers, which comprise around 40% of its net sales, are developing in-house AI-GPUs for their respective data centers. In other words, Nvidia's upside appears limited.\n\nInstead of focusing on a potential bubble stock, select Wall Street analysts see upside ranging between 223% and 557% for the following three small-cap stocks.\n\nPlug Power: Implied upside of 557%\n\nThe first small-cap stock with truly jaw-dropping upside that could handily outpace Nvidia in the return column, at least based on the lofty price target of one Wall Street analyst, is hydrogen fuel-cell solutions company Plug Power(NASDAQ: PLUG).\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to analyst Amit Dayal of H.C. Wainwright, Plug Power stock can reach $18 per share. If accurate, this would represent upside of 557% compared to the $2.74 Plug shares closed at last week. Dayal believes the company's double-digit long-term growth projections, efforts to control its expenses, and incremental margin improvements, merit this aggressive price target.\n\nOn paper, Plug Power hasn't struggled to grow its sales. While its partnership with Amazon to supply some of its warehouses with hydrogen fuel-cell-powered GenDrive forklifts has helped Plug, the long-term buzz has to do with the green hydrogen infrastructure the company is developing to (pardon the pun) fuel cleaner transportation.\n\nBut just like Dayal's price target, these ambitions may be a bit too grand for a company that hasn't been able to keep its expenses under control. Though sales catapulted from $701 million to $891 million in 2023 from the previous year, its net loss more than doubled to about $508 million from around $194 million.\n\nTo make matters worse, Plug Power has been forced to sell shares of its common stock to raise capital as it burns cash. Even if the company secures a much-awaited $1.6 billion low-interest government loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, it doesn't provide an immediate remedy for the company's ongoing cash burn.\n\nI'm no fan of Nvidia at a $2.2 trillion market cap. I might be even less of a fan of Plug Power approaching a $2 billion valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPetco Health and Wellness: Implied upside of 223%\n\nA second small-cap stock with scorching-hot upside that could potentially run circles around Nvidia, based on the forecast of one Wall Street pundit, is pet-focused retail chain Petco Health and Wellness (NASDAQ: WOOF).\n\nIn a March note, analyst Anna Andreeva of Needham maintained her firms' buy rating on Petco and stood firm on her previously issued $5 price target. If Petco were to rally to this mark, shareholders as of May 3 would enjoy 223% upside!\n\nThe lure of investing in the pet industry is simple: owners will gladly open their wallets to keep their furry, feathered, gilled, and scaled \"family members\" healthy and happy. The American Pet Products Association reported in April that \"total U.S. pet industry expenditures reached $147 billion in 2023,\" with aggregate spending on pets expected to grow annually through 2030. It's a recession-resistant industry that hasn't seen a collective sales downturn in more than a quarter of a century.\n\nOn paper, Petco Health and Wellness should be able to benefit from steady growth in U.S. pet ownership. Management has wisely been promoting higher-margin services, such as grooming, veterinary services, and pet insurance.\n\nThe major issue for Petco is that a portion of its outstanding debt sports variable rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has undertaken an aggressive rate-hiking cycle that's seen interest rates climb at their fastest pace in four decades. Put simply, Petco's operating cash flow is being gobbled up by debt-servicing expenses. That's less than ideal -- and its plummeting share price is indicative of this.\n\nWhile I do believe Petco has the tools to right the ship, its liable to remain in the doghouse in the coming quarters.\n\nNovavax: Implied upside of 285%\n\nThe third small-cap stock with sensational upside potential, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is biotech company Novavax(NASDAQ: NVAX).\n\nDespite the Novavax stock chart looking like something straight out of a horror film, analyst Vernon Bernardino of H.C. Wainwright believes shares will hit $19. Given that Novavax ended the previous week at $4.93, Bernardino's aggressive price target implies a near-quadrupling over the next year.\n\nThe reason Novavax's stock chart looks so wild has to do with its promise and missed opportunity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was one of a select few drug companies to successfully develop a COVID-19 vaccine. However, management delayed filing an emergency use authorization (EUA) application in the U.S., and the company struggled to increase vaccine production. Whereas Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech raked in tens of billions of dollars in sales from proverbial low-hanging fruit with their respective COVID-19 vaccines, Novavax missed out on virtually all of it.\n\nOn the other hand, Novavax's vaccine is differentiated. Whereas the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines rely on messenger-RNA (mRNA) technology, the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is protein-based and teaches the immune system how to recognize the virus and fight back. It provides an alternate treatment pathway for people who might be apprehensive of mRNA technology.\n\nFurther, Novavax is working on a combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine that could hit pharmacy shelves as soon as 2026, assuming accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This combo vaccine would almost certainly be a better revenue driver for the company than a seasonal COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nLastly, Novavax and global vaccine alliance Gavi reached a up to $400 million settlement in February that had been a major overhang for the company. Inclusive of significant cost-cutting efforts, Novavax has a genuine chance at becoming profitable on an operating basis by as early as next year.\n\nThough Bernardino's price target is lofty, Novavax looks to have the intangibles needed to outperform Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Plug Power wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Most investors are well aware that the S&P 500 was down 1.6% at the end of April.\n\nHowever, the ongoing earnings season and the promise of at least one rate cut later in the year have helped stocks keep momentum. Experienced investors are aware of the fact that market ups and downs are common. Simply put, it is just not possible to time the market. Instead, consider this as a time to buy the most undervalued S&P 500 stocks that have the potential to move higher as the economy improves.\n\nThese well-known industry players haven’t been able to gain momentum lately. The three stocks are legacy players in their respective sectors and have reported impressive fundamentals. They are meant to skyrocket and if you make your move, you will be able to make the most of their upward journey.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is known for cloud services in several organizations. Currently, it is a frontrunner in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. As the world’s major database software company, Oracle is building 100 data centers and has partnered with some of the biggest tech companies in the world. It is working with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to deliver Oracle cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure.\n\nAdditionally, it has partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to deliver generative AI services for consumers around the world. Oracle’s cloud services will be combined with Nvidia’s generative AI software for consumers to deploy AI factories.\n\nAnother recent development is its partnership with Palantir (NYSE:PLTR). Oracle’s cloud software will be combined with Palantir’s leading AI platform to deliver solutions for the government and businesses.\n\nThe soaring demand for Palantir’s AI software could benefit Oracle’s cloud segment and it could be a boon for the business. In Q3 results, the company saw a 49% year-over-year (YOY) growth in the cloud infrastructure revenue. So, considering the prominent partnerships, this number could easily rise in the coming quarters.\n\nAlso, Oracle is planning to invest $8 billion in cloud and AI infrastructure in Japan over the next decade. Exchanging hands for $117 today, the stock looks highly undervalued. It is moving in the range of $100 to $129 over the last six months. As one of the top tech stocks that could benefit from the growing AI demand, Oracle is a strong buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson  (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealthcare leader Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is down 7% YTD and 8% in the past 12 months. The company saw a big boost in revenue from medical device sales and reported a revenue of $21.4 billion for Q1. Its EPS stood at $2.71, while the medtech segment saw an increase in sales during the quarter and generated sales of $7.82 billion, up 4% YOY.\n\nJohnson & Johnson steadily expands its business through acquisitions. And, it recently announced the acquisition of Shockwave Medical for $13.10 billion. Also, JNJ bought Abiomed for $16.60 billion in 2022.\n\nUnfortunately, the company’s lawsuit problems haven’t gone away, which may have impacted the financials. Trading at $148 today, the stock is undervalued and considered a long-term buy and hold. So close to the 52-week low of $143, buy this dip while you have the chance.\n\nCompared to the healthcare industry average, the stock is trading at a discount. A dividend stock, JNJ has paid dividends for the past 62 years and increased the dividend by 4.2% to $1.24 in the recent quarter.\n\nOne thing to remember is that JNJ may face ups and downs but it will never go out of business. Thus, its massive umbrella of pharmaceuticals and medical devices will help the business thrive over the years.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is trading at $63 today. The stock is up 7% year-to-date (YTD) and is moving in the range of $56 to $67 since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe company reported impressive financials with a revenue of $7.7 billion, up 10% YOY, and the EPS increased 27% to $1.08. Its total payment volume was up 14% to $403.9 billion. The management lifted the profit forecast for the year and now expects it to increase by a “mid-to-high single-digit percentage”.\n\nDespite reporting a strong quarter, PYPL stock only rose 3%. Considering the high inflationary environment and low consumer spending, the costs impacted PayPal’s margins. Catering to over 400 million users, PayPal’s comeback was inevitable. It showed the ability to attract and retain customers with high user engagement and improved revenue growth.\n\nTruly, PayPal is one of the best fintech stocks to own right now. Trading at a reasonable price, and as the digital payments industry expands, it will see higher users and payment volume. It is a well-established business and one of the largest industry players. Therefore, the future looks bright for this growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still losing billions of dollars on the metaverse. In fact, in the company’s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent a good deal of time talking about how Meta loses money, including the $3.8 billion it lost on the metaverse. Still, Zuckerberg isn’t giving up on the metaverse just yet, which is creating opportunity for some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today.\n\nInstead, he’s now associating his metaverse plans with artificial intelligence. As noted by a LinkedIn.com article, “Zuckerberg believes that the integration of AI and the metaverse will revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other.”\n\nEven companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are selling “real world” goods in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) gaming environment, which is reigniting metaverse commerce, says ChainStoreAge.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“Walmart’s IRL commerce shop in its Roblox experience enables users to check out real world items chosen by its partner user generated content (UGC) creators. Walmart is adjusting its merchandising strategy to fit the metaverse, which by itself should make metaverse and retail observers sit up and take notice,” they added.\n\nIn short, don’t off the metaverse just yet. Instead, you may want to use weakness as an opportunity with some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today, such as:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best metaverse stocks to buy today is Roblox.\n\nFor one, after plummeting to a low of $33.71, Roblox is exploding higher. Last trading at $40.54, if it can break above double-top resistance, it could test $43 next.\n\nTwo, the company is opening a new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD). By doing so, advertisers will be able to reach more than half of its 71.5 million daily active users.\n\nThree, Roblox is also running on a JPMorgan upgrade, with a price target of $48.\n\n“The crux of our bull thesis is that we believe RBLX has a significant monetization opportunity ($0.06 per hour with 80% of hours not monetized) and [management’s] focus on margin leverage, which we expect to result in FCF compounding 40%+ through 2027,” said the firm, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s also the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to name a few of them.\n\nAt the moment, the ETF trades at just under $12.50, so I can spend about $1,250 for 100 shares. And I can diversify with the fund’s 38 holdings. Or, I can go out and just buy 100 shares of Nvidia and spend closer to $91,000.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $7 in late 2022, the ETF exploded to a recent high of $12.49. From here, if the metaverse story can gain traction, it could double, if not triple in value—with a good deal of patience. With the METV ETF, simply buy it, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown but not out, shares of Unity Software are sitting at strong support. In fact, if you pull up a two-year chart, you can see it’s holding and bouncing from the same support level for the seventh time since Nov. 2022. From its current price of $25.32, based on history, we’d like to see it retest around $35 a share.\n\nHelping, analysts at William Blair have a buy rating on the stock. Analysts at Wedbush have an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $33.50.\n\nAnd, as noted by Investorplace contributor Jeremy Flint, “Unity generates positive cash flow through a substantial advertising network. The ability to generate profit bolsters Unity’s stability amid broader market volatility, sustaining the company until metaverse investments garner broader institutional appeal.”\n\nMuch like the METV ETF, buy Unity Software, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months. I’d like to see this one double, with patience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) AI push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros packing an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.\n\nBut it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.\n\nBut the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will serve up at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.\n\nThe M4 and AI\n\nApple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.\n\nMillet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nOutside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.\n\nThe company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths.\n\nStill, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.\n\nThe company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party.\n\nCEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months, and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.\n\nThat includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple’s AI experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect Apple’s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.\n\nNow Apple just has to deliver.

        "title": "Earnings Superstars: 3 Stocks Primed to Outperform This Quarter",
        "content": "Companies have generally managed to perform well against the consensus of earnings forecasts, with around 77% of S&P 500 firms reporting in Q1 considered earnings outperformers. That rate is higher than the normal rate of around 74% recorded in the first three months of a year, with earnings outperformers beating historical trends.\n\nThe main theme of this quarter’s earnings reports has been artificial intelligence, with companies reporting soaring spending on the technology. Not surprisingly, AI-based and adjacent stocks have been the star earnings outperformers.\r\n\r\nWith about 80% of the major names having reported so far, some big companies that are still likely to move the market have yet to update investors on their Q1 financials. Even though the number of firms reporting earnings is declining as the season comes to an unofficial end, there are still some potential earnings outperformers left to deliver strong results despite an already solid market.\n\nNVDIA (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith AI taking center stage during this earnings season, the top performer in the space has yet to report. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a consistent AI earnings outperformer, is set to report its earnings on May 22 amid high expectations about whether its meteoric rise continues and what guidance it will provide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOther AI companies have provided positive commentary, with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) significantly increasing its orders of Nvidia’s H100 chips that power AI workloads. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also looking to nearly double its use of H100 chips in 2024 as it works to roll out full self-driving cars.\r\n\r\nAnalyst consensus forecasts Nvidia’s revenue growth will slow down from last year’s explosive pace but remain celestial, with EPS projected to rise 34% to $7.64.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has a proven track record of handily beating estimates since the AI boom, followed by a rally in its share price. Will the company deliver over $0.50 in earnings upside for the fourth consecutive quarter and turn Nvidia into another earnings outperformer?​\n\nApogee Therapeutics (APGE) pharmaceutical industry. Production line machine conveyor with glass bottles ampoules at factory\n\nSource: Dmitry Kalinovsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelatively small pharmaceutical company Apogee Therapeutics (NASDAQ:APGE) saw its stock jump over 95% after it was one of the earnings outperformers in its most recent release. Its earnings came with positive data on the progress of one of its two investigational candidates for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Atopic Dermatitis.\n\nThe AD candidate completed positive Phase 1 trials just before the earnings report. The company took advantage of the post-earnings stock surge to sell $420 million worth of shares, though the stock price has retreated slightly since.\r\n\r\nWhile the company hasn’t scheduled its next earnings date yet, it historically reports in early June. Investors will then get more details of the company’s financials and pipeline, including an increased cash position of approximately double its $399.5 million cash on hand last time it reported following the share issuance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis provides a fairly comfortable runway to complete ongoing clinical trials as the company works to establish itself as a potential earnings outperformer in the biopharma industry.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs investors worried about China’s economic recovery earlier this year, Chinese tech firm JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and other Chinese stocks saw their share price plummet.\n\nHowever, China’s Q1 GDP growth exceeded expectations, and Chinese tech stocks have rebounded, with some still making a recovery. JD.com currently trades at a relatively low price-to-earnings P/E ratio of 15.15, showing a notable gap from its American equivalent, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a P/E ratio of 52.\r\n\r\nJD.com is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 16. Analysts estimate forecast earnings of $0.65 per share, slightly below the $0.66 reported in the previous year.\n\nHowever, JD.com has a solid track record of beating analyst estimates and being an earnings outperformer. Given it topped analysts’ EPS estimate of $4.51 per share by 17% at $5.30 in March for the fiscal year 2023, recording a straight 10-year beat, and an attractive valuation, JD.com remains well-positioned as an earnings outperformer for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets",
        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nOn May 8, the S&P 500 faced resistance after a four-day winning streak, its longest run since March. The index stayed below the 5,200 level it had briefly reached earlier in the week, reflecting a loss of momentum in the stock market. The day's trading was characterized by fluctuations, with notable declines in major technology companies such as Nvidia and Tesla. These losses played a role in tempering Wall Street's enthusiasm for stocks. Uber Technologies also suffered a sharp drop after reporting disappointing first-quarter bookings, while Intel saw a decline due to a downgraded revenue outlook in light of a U.S. ban on chip exports to Huawei Technologies. At the same time, oil prices reversed earlier losses after a decline in U.S. stockpiles suggested a tightening market. West Texas Intermediate crude traded above $78 a barrel as the Energy Information Administration reported a reduction of 1.36 million barrels in inventories. This shift in the oil market is seen as a bullish indicator amid generally bearish technical trends. These factors reflect an inflection point in the market, as investors reassess their positions amid evolving economic conditions, corporate performance concerns, and changes in the oil market. Futures positioning has raised doubts about the strength of the S&P 500's recent gains, suggesting that some investors are more cautious about the sustainability of the rally.\n\nOn May 8, an official from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the growing divisions between the United States and China, warning that their trade tensions could hinder global economic growth. The U.S. has heightened trade restrictions and sanctions on China, citing national security concerns and ongoing disputes in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, reported CNBC. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath noted that trade relations between the U.S.-led Western bloc and the China-aligned bloc have weakened since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Trade between these blocs has decreased by roughly 12%, and foreign direct investment has fallen by 20% compared to levels within these groups. The IMF estimates that, in the most extreme scenario, these divisions could cost the world up to 7% of its GDP. The pandemic and geopolitical strife have disrupted international trade patterns not seen since the Cold War, according to Gopinath. Increasingly, countries are focusing on economic and national security when making trade and investment decisions. This trend threatens to undermine a rules-based global trading system and the benefits of economic integration. However, while the global economy faces significant challenges due to fragmentation, the overall trade-to-GDP ratio has been relatively stable over the past two decades. This stability is partly due to the role of neutral countries like Mexico and Vietnam, which act as connectors for rerouting trade and investment between the U.S. and China. These non-aligned nations leverage their economic and diplomatic influence to help keep the world economy integrated. The presence of these neutral mediators may serve as a buffer against the full impact of the ongoing U.S.-China tensions, providing a pathway for continued international cooperation and trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the stock market front, analysts are bullish on stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) among many others. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.\n\nA Wall Street trader on the trading floor discussing the company's stock performance.\n\n10. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)\n\nUpside Potential: 11%\n\nOn May 7, Piper Sandler upgraded its price target for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), which is a biopharmaceutical company, raising the target to $456 from $450. The firm maintained its Overweight rating on the shares due to a significant financial outperformance in the first quarter. The company exhibited strong results in both its top-line and bottom-line performance. Piper Sandler highlighted that despite a mention of some inventory benefits from international channels, the key focus of the story is on the company's advances in its late-stage pipeline. Specifically, Piper Sandler is optimistic about the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for vanza, with the potential for approval in January 2025. Additionally, progress on the rolling NDA for suzetrigine, targeting acute pain, is underway and is expected to be completed this quarter. The current market price for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stands at $422.52, and the new price target suggests an upside potential of approximately 11%. This indicates that investors could see substantial gains given Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) promising developments and pipeline progression.\n\nJust like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), wall street analysts are also bullish on Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX).\n\n09. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\n\nUpside Potential: 15%\n\nOn May 7, UBS analyst Michael Lasser raised the firm's price target for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), a major player in the retail industry, to $69 from $63 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. This revision suggests an upside potential of 15% compared to the current market price of $60.76. In a research note to investors, Lasser acknowledged that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) performed well in the first quarter, even with the unpredictable consumer spending environment and challenges such as the impact of an earlier Easter and pressures facing lower-income households. UBS believes that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) performance in the quarter will meet expectations and demonstrate that the company's strategic investments are paying off. The firm sees Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) ongoing ability to capture market share both domestically and internationally as a significant advantage. This market share expansion, along with other factors, indicates that the stock has potential for further growth and suggests that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains a strong investment option.\n\n08. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nUpside Potential: 17%\n\nOn May 7, HSBC raised its price target for Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a leading company in the online travel industry, to $4,230 from $4,220 and reaffirmed its Buy rating on the shares. The stock is currently trading at $3,624.05, which indicates an upside potential of 17% following the upgrade. HSBC's decision to increase the price target reflects its preference for Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) within the U.S. online travel market. The firm's analyst noted Booking's advantage in terms of scale and consistent execution, which distinguishes it from competitors in the space. The performance gap between Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and its peers has become more pronounced, particularly in the first quarter, across various metrics. The recommendation suggests that Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) strong market position and operational effectiveness make it a promising investment opportunity, with room for significant growth. As the company continues to leverage its strengths in the online travel sector, investors can expect potential benefits from its ongoing success.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) contributed negatively to relative performance. The Company grew bookings on their platforms +16% and reported +22% growth in adjusted operating income during their fourth quarter of 2023. We think the market is cautious about the Company’s results for 2024 because they will be lapping very high levels of growth compared to those in 2023 (full year 2023 bookings growth +24%). However, Booking’s end markets continue to be quite healthy, outside of geographies affected by war because consumers still have plenty of wallet share to re-dedicate to travel compared to pre-COVID-19 numbers. We applaud the Company as they aggressively repurchase shares at valuation levels well below the market and peers. This should serve to compound our ownership in Booking’s business, which has exceptional pro2itability.”\n\n07. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)\n\nUpside Potential: 18%\n\nOn May 7, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst J. Rahmani raised the price target for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), a leading homebuilder in the real estate and construction industry, from $172 to $178 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. With the current market price at $149.03, this new target implies an upside potential of 18% for investors. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is known for its reputation as one of the largest and most respected homebuilders in the United States. The company operates across multiple markets, offering a wide range of housing options to meet the needs of diverse customer bases. Analyst J. Rahmani's decision to raise the price target reflects confidence in the company's ability to sustain its strong performance and capitalize on opportunities within the housing market.\n\nOn the same day, UBS also increased its price target for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) from $192 to $200 while maintaining its Buy rating on the stock. UBS's revised target reflects the company's solid performance in the second quarter and its positive outlook. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is known for its excellence and consistent high-level execution, even in the face of challenging interest rate environments, according to the UBS analyst. The firm believes that D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), along with other major publicly traded homebuilders, is poised to continue benefiting from robust demographic demand, limited availability of existing homes, and the company's size, scale, and financial advantages compared to most private competitors. These factors contribute to D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) strong position in the homebuilding industry, making it an attractive investment opportunity for investors.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The share prices of our investments in homebuilder companies – Toll Brothers, Inc., D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), Inc., and Lennar Corporation – gained 39.4%, 41.8%, and 33.2%, respectively, in the most recent quarter, in part due to the continuation of strong quarterly business results, management optimism about 2024 prospects, and a more than 100 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates during the quarter.\n\n2023 was an excellent year for the public homebuilders. Housing fundamentals were resilient despite the affordability challenges of elevated mortgage rates and home prices. Several years of pent-up demand, fears that mortgage rates could move higher, a dearth of inventory in the existing home market, and an overall housing supply shortage drove home buyers off the sidelines to “stretch their wallet,” in part due to fears that they could miss out on the opportunity to buy a home. The Fund’s homebuilding companies Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar increased 108.0%, 71.4%, and 66.3%, respectively, in 2023.\n\nThough we anticipate more modest gains for the Fund’s homebuilder investments in 2024, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton, and Lennar. Further, we continue to believe there is a compelling case for the homebuilder valuations to re-rate higher over time.\n\nSince the beginning of 2020, D.R. Horton, Lennar, and Toll Brothers have demonstrated substantial resilience and operating prowess. Despite several black swan events – COVID-19, a sharp increase in mortgage rates from 3% to 8%, and supply-chain disruptions – each company has managed its business exceptionally well and demonstrated that the demand to buy homes is resilient.”\n\n06. Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA)\n\nUpside Potential: 18%\n\nSimilar to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Wall Street analysts also have a positive outlook on Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA). On May 7, Susquehanna increased its price target for Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), a leading player in the oil and gas industry, from $32 to $33 while maintaining its Positive rating on the stock. With the current market price at $28.19, the new target represents an 18% upside potential for investors. The firm’s decision to raise the price target highlights its optimism about Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) future performance. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the energy sector, given its strong operational capabilities and strategic focus. Investors might find Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) an attractive option due to its potential for growth and profitability in the oil and gas market, as indicated by the favorable outlook from Susquehanna.\n\nDiamond Hill Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other bottom contributors in Q4 includedCoterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), VF Corporation and Ciena Corporation. Coterra Energy is an oil exploration and production company focused in West Texas’s Permian Basin and Oklahoma. Though production is beating expectations, shares traded in sympathy with the broader industry, which declined alongside falling oil and natural gas prices.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 States with the Largest Oil Reserves in the US 20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia 15 Best Places to Retire in Georgia\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "US chip manufacturing capacity projected to triple by 2032, fueled by CHIPS Act: Industry leader",
        "content": "US chip manufacturing capacity is projected to triple by 2032, according to a new report published by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), signaling progress nearly two years after President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law.\n\nThat increase is expected to grow the US's share of global semiconductor production to 14% by 2032 from 10% today, marking growth in the country’s manufacturing footprint for the first time in decades, according to the SIA.\n\n“It's going to take us years to climb back,” John Neuffer, president and CEO of SIA, said to Yahoo Finance. “But with the CHIPS Act and with all these private sector investments, we absolutely turned the corner and are heading now in the right direction.”\n\nThe report card, conducted in partnership with Boston Consulting Group, comes amid a global push to expand chipmaking capacity to address growing demand, particularly in advanced semiconductors used for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe US has maintained its lead in chip design and research and development, led by companies like Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), but it manufactures just 10% of the global chip supply. Meanwhile, 100% of all advanced chips are developed overseas, mostly by TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan.\n\nThat reality and fear of a supply disruption prompted the Biden administration to pass the $50 billion CHIPS Act in 2022, aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the US. The incentives included in that package have attracted nearly half a trillion dollars in investments to build fabrication facilities in the US, according to Neuffer.\n\nIntel, which has received $8.5 billion in federal grants, has been the biggest beneficiary. The company has invested more than $100 billion to expand manufacturing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon.\n\n“[The CHIPS Act] has leveled the playing field when it comes to companies deciding where to put the next fab,” Neuffer said.\n\nUS subsidies have set off a type of global land to incentivize chip manufacturing. Europe is attempting to attract fab development with its own $47 billion package. Japan has pushed to reclaim its position as a semiconductor powerhouse by extending $17.5 billion in grants to industry leaders, including TSMC and Micron (MU). And China, largely limited by US export controls, has looked to build out its own chipmaking capabilities with more than $150 billion in investments.\n\nFurthermore, the SIA estimates that private investments in wafer fabrication will total $2.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nSupply-demand imbalances\n\nNeuffer said the scale of investments made since 2022 has put the US in a stronger position to compete for advanced chip manufacturing, with the country set to capture 28% of the market for chips below 10 nanometers by 2032. A smaller nanometer size indicates a more powerful chip.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, oversupply remains a concern, particularly for processors that are most widely used in devices like smartphones and consumer electronics.\n\nThe SIA report said the trajectory of current fabrication plant construction puts the capacity of future demand for \"legacy\" chips that are 28 nanometers and above “substantially in excess of future demand,” particularly in China, leading to price decreases. US President Joe Biden, with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, arrives to speak about rebuilding US manufacturing through the CHIPS and Science Act at the groundbreaking of the new Intel semiconductor manufacturing facility near New Albany, Ohio, on Sept. 9, 2022. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) (SAUL LOEB via Getty Images)\n\nA shortage of workers to fill new fabrication facilities is also a concern. TSMC cited an “insufficient amount of skilled workers” when it announced a delay in its Arizona facility last summer, saying it would need to send technicians from Taiwan to train its US workforce. In December, the company agreed to develop a workforce training program to resolve a labor dispute there.\n\nNeuffer said the semiconductor industry faces a projected shortfall of 67,000 workers this decade, particularly with a lack of engineers, computer scientists, and technicians. He said more training programs and STEM course development are needed to support an industry whose workforce is expected to grow by nearly 115,000 jobs in that time period.\n\n“It's going to take a lot of people to fill these fabs up,” he said. “This is an issue we are focused like a laser on, but it's going to take public support as well in the universities and the community colleges.”\n\nAkiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "What's in the Offing for Gen Digital (GEN) This Earnings Season?",
        "content": "Gen Digital GEN is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 9. Gen Digital was formerly known as NortonLifeLock Inc. and was trading under the NLOK ticker symbol.\n\nNortonLifeLock changed its name and ticker symbol, effective from Nov 8, 2022, following the completed merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast Plc. The newly named company unites trusted consumer safety brands, including Norton, Avast, LifeLock, AVG, Avira, CCleaner and ReputationDefender.\n\nThe company projects quarterly revenues between $960 million and $970 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $964.8 million, which indicates a 1.9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $947 million.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 52-54 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 52 cents per share, which calls for a 13% increase from the year-ago reported figure of 46 cents.\n\nThe company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 1.8%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.\n\nGen Digital Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nGen Digital Inc. price-eps-surprise | Gen Digital Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nGEN’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the increased demand for cybersecurity and ID analytics solutions in the hybrid work environment. Over the past couple of years, as more people are shifting online, the need for online privacy has been rising. Global workforces working remotely are logging into employers' networks, escalating the need for digital security. This trend is likely to have spurred the demand for Gen Digital’s security products in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nOur fourth-quarter estimate for Gen Digital’s Consumer Security segment’s revenues is pegged at $614.6 million, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 2.3%. Our estimate of $333.6 million for the Identity and Information Protection division implies growth of 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nGen Digital’s fourth-quarter top line is also likely to have been primarily driven by the inclusion of the Avast business, which significantly increased the combined company’s Average Direct Customer count. Our fourth-quarter estimate for this key metric is pegged at 38.4 million.\n\nMoreover, the expansion of product offerings following the merger of NortonLifeLock and Avast is likely to have facilitated the newly formed company to cross-sell products to each other’s customers, thereby aiding Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”) growth. Gen Digital’s ARPU increased by 12 cents to $7.21 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 from $7.09 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe anticipate the trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Our fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 estimate for ARPU is pegged at $7.32, which is 8 cents higher than the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 level.\n\nAn expansion in the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions is also likely to have been an upside for GEN this season. Further, the growing number of client bookings, supported by their retention and renewal rates, is anticipated to have contributed to the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter top line. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Gen Digital’s client retention rate was 77%, while bookings grew 4% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nHowever, GEN’s overall fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by softening IT spending. Still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions are hurting consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\n\nAdditionally, increased interest expenses due to enhanced debt related to Avast acquisition financing are likely to have weighed on the bottom line. Moreover, the company’s earnings per share are expected to be negatively impacted by the equity dilution impact of the Avast acquisition. To finance the acquisition of Avast, Gen Digital issued 94 million new shares.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Gen Digital this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nThough GEN currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3, it has an Earnings ESP of -1.92%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Agilent Technologies A and Zscaler ZS have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.50%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 20.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s first-quarter earnings stands at $5.49 per share, which indicates a year-over-year improvement of 403.7%. It is estimated to report revenues of $24.17 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 236.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAgilent Technologies is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 29. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.72% at present. Agilent Technologies’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.19 per share, which suggests a decrease of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.27. Agilent Technologies’ quarterly revenues are estimated to decline 8% to $1.58 billion from $1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%. The company is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jun 6. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 28.2%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zscaler’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents per share, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 35.4%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $535.6 million, which calls for a year-over-year rise of 27.9%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings",
        "content": "Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nDespite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are once again on investors’ radars.\n\nAnalysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings, noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.\n\nApart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization. And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.\n\nAs a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.\n\nStory continues\n\niShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) iShares by Blackrock sign\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.\n\nTherefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) stands out as a compelling choice. This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.\n\nSince its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.\n\nAmong its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).\n\nIYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.\n\nRecently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.\n\nInvestors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.\n\nSo far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in META stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Undervalued tech stocks are attracting eyeballs this year because of two elements: the astronomical rise of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the three anticipated rate cuts from the now more dovish Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is why the tech sector is up 13.5% so far this year, better than the S&P 500‘s 9% gain. Goldman Sachs says the index will return 6%, which includes dividends, which means to beat the market this year, invest in undervalued tech stocks.\n\nAnalysts have given all three of the undervalued tech stocks we will look at a “strong buy” rating with double-digit upsides. This is because they are all working on new ways to make AI more widely used and to protect data.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe first pick on this list of undervalued tech stocks is a cybersecurity expert teaming up with AWS and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). The second has a platform with over 200 million customers and wants to expand beyond Taiwan by including sports broadcasts and speedier delivery. The final selection partners with the U.S. Department of Commerce to potentially receive $6.6 billion in funding for a new manufacturing factory in Arizona.\n\nCome on, let’s explore further!\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock has made a big comeback and is now selling at around $188, which is up 25% from the start of the year, but most analysts are still recommending that investors “buy” the stock, with a target price of $219.5 per share for the next 12 months, a 16% upside.\n\nPart of the reason for optimism is consistent innovation and growth. For example, Amazon is working overtime to expand its Amazon Web Services (AWS) system. AWS opened a new region in Calgary, Canada, the company’s second infrastructure area in the country. Amazon has also created the AWS European Sovereign Cloud to meet the needs of businesses in Europe subject to strict rules.\n\nIn the meantime, CES 2024 saw Amazon and Siemens (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) announce a partnership to link Amazon Bedrock to Siemens’ Mendix platform. This alliance seeks to make creative AI technologies easy to use in many sectors.\n\nOn the streaming end, Amazon Prime Video is adding more sports shows from around the world, like NASCAR and Wimbledon tennis in certain regions.\n\nAMZN investors should monitor Amazon Prime, which includes the streaming business, since its 200 million users generated $40.2 billion in 2023. In 2021, growth was 33%; in 2023, 8%. Market saturation, notably in the U.S., caused this slowdown. Amazon is offering Prime members speedier delivery, exclusive bargains, and more entertainment, to stop the drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) investors are thrilled about its new deal with AWS, which will speed up the growth of AI and cloud security. The deal also includes making more use of Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker and standardizing security on CrowdStrike’s AI-native Falcon platform.\n\nCrowdStrike and Tata Consultancy Services have also made a global strategy deal to use Falcon XDR to change the way business hacking is done. Falcon’s combined protection, which includes cloud security and next-generation security information and event management (SIEM), will be available to TCS through this deal. This will allow AI-powered system-on-chip (SOC) change that stops hacks.\n\nThe National Australia Bank and CrowdStrike are also working together to keep small and medium-sized businesses safe online.\n\nThese interactions and partnerships have made CrowdStrike well-known in its sector. KuppingerColeand IDC rank it as a leader in Identity Threat Detection and Response and in the 2024 Worldwide Managed Detection and Response MarketScape.\n\nLastly, new ideas are a big part of CrowdStrike’s success and potential upside of 25%. CrowdStrike said at Google Cloud Next ’24 that it would also be adding new security tools to the Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S. Department of Commerce recently agreed to collaborate. As a result of the tie-up, TSMC could receive up to $6.6 billion in funds through the CHIPS Act.\n\nIt’s part of their plan to build a third manufacturing plant in Arizona. That plant will make advanced electronics. With this addition, TSMC will have invested over $65 billion in Arizona so far.​\n\nTSMC is also expanding its business worldwide, opening a second chipmaking plant in Japan. The new factory is part of Taiwan-based TSMC’s plan to increase the reliability of its supply chain and expand its production sites.​\n\nIn addition, India and TSMC are working together to see if it is possible to set up a hub for semiconductors there. This move is part of larger talks between Taiwan and India.\n\nThe excitement around chipmaker Nvidia is also helping TSMC’s shares. Thanks to its AI hardware solutions, Nvidia is the third U.S. firm with a $2 trillion market worth and is driving the tech-led market revival in 2024.\n\nTSMC’s shares rose after Morgan Stanley boosted its Nvidia target price, illustrating their correlation. However, TSMC does not need Nvidia to stand on its own feet; the stock holds a “strong buy” consensus rating, with a 16% projected upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "If you’re looking for stocks to buy for the next decade, there are a lot to choose from, especially if you’re looking to buy on weakness. After all, buying on weakness can often help you realize outstanding returns over the long haul.\n\nIn addition, companies that have a well-established customer base and offer products with staying power are unlikely to disappoint in the long run. A big plus is if they have megatrend tailwinds that will boost them even further in the next 10 or so years. Here are seven such stocks to buy for the next decade.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) has been one of the hardest-hit stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYear to date, for example, it’s down about 29%. All thanks to news its planes were having severe maintenance issues. Worse, there were valid criticisms of how the company manufactures its planes and the potential negligence in the production line. These criticisms gave birth to even more trouble for Boeing, with two whistleblowers dying within a short span of each other.\n\nThe good news, though, is that with most of the negativity firmly priced into the Boeing stock, it created a buying opportunity. After all, Boeing is one of the world’s biggest suppliers of commercial passenger aircraft.\n\nAlso, at a time when China is expanding its own Boeing copy “COMAC,” I find it hard to believe that Boeing will not receive lots of support going forward. There are no big financial problems here, and once rate cuts kick in, I expect the stock to significantly outperform. BA EPS. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is a company that is very popular with the younger generation. This is primarily why I think CROX could perform well going forward.\n\nSince recommending CROX in mid-2022, it’s up 160%. However, I still strongly believe it can return even more in the next decade.\n\nHelping, analysts believe EPS expansion will be around 8-9% annually going forward, along with mid-single-digit revenue growth in the next few years. These aren’t stellar numbers by any means. However, I still expect it to outperform those expectations, just as it has in every quarter since Q2 2020. It has also made smart acquisitions, like HEYDUDE. Plus, cash flow growth for CROX has been impressive. crocs cash flow. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nIn my opinion, international markets will be where Crocs shines the most in the coming years. In Q4, International Crocs revenue jumped 24.9% to $261.2 million. DTC revenue soared 40.0%, while wholesale revenue jumped 18.3%. Asia revenue jumped 36%, with Europe up 16%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is an e-commerce company that is also up triple digits since I first started covering it. And, again, I see a lot more gains going forward. E-commerce is certainly the future, and more businesses are expanding their outreach by listing their products online.\n\nA lot of small and mid-sized businesses use Shopify for this. Granted, they can use Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for this, but Shopify allows businesses to have their own dedicated e-commerce sites. SHOP revenue. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nA metric that makes me really bullish is the merchant count. Shopify’s merchant count is growing fast, and so is the volume. Analysts expect EPS to grow over 5X from $1 to $5.4 from 2024 to 2033, along with revenue growing from $8.6 billion to $35.1 billion in the same period. I think the current premium for the stock is worth it with this sort of growth. FCF was $905 million in 2023 compared to -$186 million in 2022.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the biggest winners since 2022. It’s also one that could continue to deliver stellar returns over the next decade.\n\nThe stock checks all the boxes. First, this is a company that is well-positioned to exploit the biggest tech breakthrough we’ve seen in decades, which is artificial intelligence (AI). Some even think the AI windfall will end up being bigger than the internet.\n\nThe second is that this company is sort of like the underdog here, and AMD already has a lot of experience being the underdog. AMD is currently lagging behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI chips sector just as it was lagging Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a few decades before in the CPU sector.\n\nAMD is working on AI chips that can rival those of Nvidia in the next few years and already has MI300. In my view, AMD can repeat history and dethrone Nvidia in the AI chips space just as it managed to crack Intel’s CPU dominance. Even if it doesn’t, you’re unlikely to see losses with a company like AMD.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings (UAL) a picture of an airplane flying with the sun in the background. Airline Stocks to Buy and Hold\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is one of the biggest airline companies, and it almost doubled its debt load from $20.5 billion in 2019 to $39.4 billion in 2021.\n\nTaking on this much debt to keep the business afloat was a necessary evil. Unfortunately, it also created substantial long-term issues. For example, with sky-high interest rates, the company has been forced to pay ~$430 million in interest expenses every quarter on average since Q3 2020. This has put a dent in profits. However, the company has been recovering very well and paying off debt despite this pressure. UAL interest expense. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nDebt is down to $32.3 billion as of Q1, with $14 billion in cash. Moreover, the three-year free cash flow growth rate is at 66.6%. In addition, the three-year sales growth rate is 43.3%. I think this is a remarkable rebound, which should translate into the stock bouncing much higher in the coming years as well.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a controversial pick, but I find it hard to believe that this company won’t deliver stellar gains if you hold it for the next decade. It is going through near-term weakness mainly due to rate hikes that have caused many consumers to pull back on big-ticket purchases that involve borrowing. Once rates come down, we should see a rebound in sales and the momentum should continue. Tesla sales estimates. stocks to buy for the next decade\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe thing that makes me really bullish about Tesla is that there is simply no competition here in the West. Many Chinese EV companies and startups are doing well right now, but those are unlikely to ever dominate the U.S. market. The EV startups that are in the U.S. are burning billions in cash with no light at the end of the tunnel. Tesla looks like the obvious winner in the EV space.\n\nBofA Securities analyst John Murphy upgraded their rating to buy from neutral and affirmed a $220 price target. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Overweight rating and a $310 price target.\n\nOuster (OUST) Graphic demonstrating self-driving car technology\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOuster (NYSE:OUST) is also an indirect automotive pick, but the stock can benefit from the booming robotics market as well. It is a lidar supplier and it has been delivering robust gains recently. The stock is up 120% in the past year and I think it can deliver quadruple-digit gains in the next decade if the stars align.\n\nLidar is better than radar and camera technology but is prohibitively expensive for automakers to adopt. However, lidar costs have been coming down, and many companies are trying it out.\n\nIn my opinion, if the current trajectory continues, costs could come down enough for it to be adopted more widely. Ouster is expected to see its revenue grow from $116.2 million in 2024 to $2.2 billion in 2030. It is not profitable yet, but profitability is expected in 2027 with significant expansion afterward. It also has $190 million in cash to provide a buffer against near-term losses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Best Growth Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "It’s been a tremendous year for growth stocks. New technologies and increasing consumer adoption in fields such a semiconductors, electric vehicles, and generative AI have led to tremendous gains for growth stocks. In addition, mega-cap tech companies continue to report solid earnings and attract tons of investor capital.\n\nWhile growth stocks have been sizzling hot, they cooled off a bit in April. Concerns about higher inflation and a potential twist in Federal Reserve interest rate policy seemingly led to some profit taking in growth stocks.\n\nDoes that make it too late to ride the growth stock wave? Not at all. However, investors should be prudent and select growth stocks which have strong risk/reward ratios. These are seven of the best growth stocks to buy today that are still at compelling valuations and should have plenty of upside ahead in coming months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVeriSign (VRSN) verisign logo on a sign\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany people love the idea of investing in toll road-style assets. These sorts of infrastructure businesses get to charge a set use fee to every passenger, making for an amazing business.\n\nWhat’s unique about VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) is that it effectively serves as a toll road for the internet. That’s because it serves as a key domain registry, operating as a vital backbone for the global internet network.\n\nVeriSign has the exclusive license to operate all of the .dom and .net website domains worldwide. VeriSign charges approximately $9.75 per year for each registry, and its contract allows it to raise prices about 8.5% per year on average.\n\nGiven that VeriSign has operated these domains since the 1990s and has a contract that can likely be renewed in perpetuity, this makes for a tremendous long-term asset. VeriSign shares have plunged over the past year amid weakness in online spending and the Chinese market in particular.\n\nThat makes a compelling longer-term buying opportunity. This is especially true since VeriSign uses its cash flows to aggressively repurchase its own stock. With the share price currently being depressed, the buyback program will generate a higher rate of return for investors going forward.\n\nEndava (DAVA) The logo for Endava (DAVA) displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com\n\nEndava (NYSE:DAVA) is an information technology outsourcing company. Specifically, its business model is to hire highly qualified IT professionals in lower cost-of-living countries, such as Poland, Colombia, and India; it utilizes those workers to carry out IT services for major multinational companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe business model has proven highly successful both for Endava and rivals such as EPAM Systems (NYSE:EPAM) over the years.\n\nHowever, Endava’s customer base is skewed towards the payments, financial services, and banking sectors. With those categories being in a downturn recently, client spending has slowed down. This deceleration led to an abrupt 40% decline in DAVA’s stock price following its latest earnings report.\n\nThis plunge appears to be grossly overdone. Management has said that clients are merely deferring spending for a couple of quarters rather than abandoning future expansion plans. Endava also just made a large acquisition to expand its position in the healthcare vertical.\n\nThese factors should power revenues over the next year. In addition, Endava appears to be a winner from generative AI, as Endava can help large and sometimes stodgy companies to implement cutting-edge technology solutions into their existing workflows.\n\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) provides product testing, quality assurance and design solutions to technology companies.\n\nThe company started operations as part of Hewlett-Packard’s (NYSE:HP) Test & Measurement division more than half a century ago. Keysight ultimately became its own publicly traded company in 2014 following a spin-off.\n\nKeysight shares initially ramped up from around $30 at the time of the spin-off to a peak of more than $200. The company enjoyed a strong operating environment as an independent company that could pursue fresh growth opportunities. In addition, key clients such as telecom and mobile communications firms were spending heavily to deploy 5G solutions; Keysight is a leading provider of testing and quality assurance for 5G networks.\n\nSince the peak, however, KEYS stock has pulled back about 25%. Spending in the 5G arena has dramatically slowed. Other Keysight markets such as RFID units and edge computing have also tapered off a bit.\n\nHowever, several of these fields appear to be reaching a positive inflection point. In addition, Keysight offers testing solutions for fields such as semiconductors and AI functionality which should be robust growth markets going forward. All this sets Keysight up to be an excellent buy during this current downturn.\n\nCharles River Laboratories (CRL) The logo for Charles River Laboratories (CRL) displayed on a smartphone with a blue stock chart in the background.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCharles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) has built a unique business. The Boston-based life sciences firm was founded in 1947 to provides the lab specimens — such as mice, rats and monkeys — for clinical trials on pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nWhile Charles River got its start with lab animals, the firm is far larger and more diversified today. Now, it also offers software and services, trial design, and outsourced clinical research organization functionality, among other items.\n\nIn effect, Charles River collects a small tax on nearly the entirety of the biotech and pharmaceutical research space; incredibly, Charles River was involved in the development of an astounding 80% of all drugs which received FDA approval over the past few years. That’s a pretty strong competitive moat.\n\nCharles River enjoyed an unusual burst of revenue tied to COVID-19 vaccine research and lab testing. Investors bid CRL stock up to the stratosphere on this large but temporary revenue stream.\n\nAs COVID-19 revenues rolled off, CRL stock crashed with it. However, with the stock down more than 50% off its highs, this has been a gross overreaction.\n\nThe company has posted a double-digit compounded annualized earnings growth rate for decades now. And management forecasts a return to double-digit growth as industry conditions clear up. Make no mistake, with the world’s aging demographics, there will be a global surge in biotech spending, and Charles River will reap the rewards.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest analog semiconductor company by market share.\n\nAnalog chips are vital because they allow devices to translate real-world information, such as weather conditions, into data that devices can recognize. Analog chips are a huge piece of the Internet of Things theme, as all sorts of appliances and devices can now connect to the Internet and be controlled remotely.\n\nTexas Instruments has 10,000s of thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs) with a vast array of offerings that touch almost all modern industries. That said, the company has leaned into several major growth avenues such as smart cars. The computing intensity of vehicles is skyrocketing as automakers make vehicles increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. The rise of electric vehicles, self-driving operations, and other such next-generation automobile technology will further enlarge Texas Instruments’ opportunity.\n\nTXN shares have underperformed other semiconductor and growth stocks in recent quarters. That likely comes because the automobile and other core industrial markets have been relatively weak. Texas Instruments also has less exposure to fields like AI that have captured investors’ imaginations recently.\n\nHowever, Texas Instrument’s long track record of growing cash flows, huge share repurchases, and a generous dividend all stack up to make this a blue-chip growth stock that investors can count on for the long-term.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is another quality semiconductor company that is currently on sale.\n\nTo be sure, Intel has its critics. Intel has struggled to keep up with rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in key markets. It has also not been at the forefront of the all-important artificial intelligence chip trend, letting Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) grab a huge leadership position.\n\nIntel’s recent earnings have been quite poor as the company is struggling with weak CPU demand and falling profit margins. However, the company has a secret weapon — its long-term investment program.\n\nIntel is pouring tens of billions of dollars into new semiconductor foundry capacity. The idea here being that Intel can develop a large manufacturing unit for producing other companies’ semiconductor chips. With Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  (NYSE:TSM) facing political risk and the Biden Administration investing heavily in domestic chip manufacturing capacity, this is a golden opportunity for Intel.\n\nThe firm is undoubtedly in a cyclical downturn right now. But the long-term strategy makes sense. And CEO Pat Gelsinger has been buying Intel shares recently on the open market, suggesting that there is considerable value to be had at current prices.\n\nCorporacion America Airports (CAAP) two women carrying luggage in an airport\n\nSource: Shine Nucha / Shutterstock\n\nCorporacion America Airports (NYSE:CAAP) is one of the world’s largest private airport operators; it controls 52 airports in total serving more than 81 million passengers annually. Its key market is Argentina, where it controls the various Buenos Aires airports – Argentina generates around half of revenues and EBITDA in a given year. The balance of the firm’s airports are in Brazil, Italy, Ecuador, Armenia, and Uruguay respectively.\n\nCorporacion America Airports had a near-death experience during the pandemic, with shares dropping from a prior high of $17 to just $2 per share at one point. But the company slashed costs and was able to obtain government aid to make it through the pandemic.\n\nAs a result, while passenger traffic is only slightly above pre-pandemic levels, total profitability is multiples higher.\n\nAnd the growth is bound to continue. The election of libertarian firebrand Javier Milei to Argentina’s presidency seems likely to rein in that country’s inflation problem and unleash a new era of economic prosperity in Argentina. Making matters even better, Mr. Milei happened to be Corporacion America’s chief economist prior to becoming president, ensuring he will give private sector infrastructure companies a fair shake during his presidency.\n\nCAAP stock has rallied 50% over the past year on the more favorable travel environment and improving political conditions in Argentina. Even so, shares still go for just 11 times forward earnings and an estimated seven times estimated 2025 earnings. That’s a deep bargain for this growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in DAVA, KEYS, VRSN, CRL, TXN, INTC, CAAP and EPAM stock.

        "title": "1 Major Difference Between 401(k)s and IRAs That You Should Know, Before You Save Any More for Retirement",
        "content": "There are several major differences between 401(k)s and IRAs. Some of them are rather well-known.\n\nOne major difference is investment flexibility. With an employer’s 401(k), you're generally limited to a small \"menu\" of investment funds. This can be fine if you want to keep your retirement investing on autopilot, but an IRA lets you invest in virtually any stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds you want. If you want some of your retirement savings in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock, for example, an IRA can let you do it.\n\nSome differences between 401(k)s and IRAs aren’t quite as well-known but can be very important to understand. One of the biggest differences is how you can use these accounts early. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUsing your retirement savings early\n\nIn most cases, you have to leave your 401(k) and IRA savings alone until you reach 59 1/2 years of age. Both have some exceptions, but they are very different.\n\nWhen it comes to a 401(k), there are a few reasons you’d be allowed to withdraw money early without a penalty. Most notably, there’s the \"separation from service\" exception, which says that if you are no longer working for the employer who sponsored the plan and you’re older than 55, you can withdraw money.\n\nOn the other hand, IRAs have two big exceptions that don’t apply to 401(k)s:\n\nYou can withdraw up to $10,000 from your IRA to use towards a first-time home purchase for you or someone else. You can withdraw any amount at any time to use towards higher education expenses. Many parents use IRAs to help pay for college, and simply use what’s left for their own retirement.\n\nOverall, IRAs are more flexible than 401(k)s when it comes to both investment flexibility and early withdrawals. Even if you have a 401(k) or similar plan at work, it could be smart to supplement it with an IRA -- only after you’ve taken full advantage of your employer’s matching contributions, of course.\n\nWhat stocks should you add to your retirement portfolio?\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years, potentially setting you up for a more prosperous retirement.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $564,547!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term \"AI\" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.\n\nWithin that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a \"trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure\" to transform computing from \"general purpose to accelerated.\"\n\nSince then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:\n\n\"So now, we're in the beginning of this new era. And what's going to happen is, there's about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we'll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that's really at the core of what is happening. While we're replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can't assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.\n\nAnd, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward.\n\nFor Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft's overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment's sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that \"AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company's Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud's AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that \"60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) \"deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.\"\n\n\"And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\"\n\nSo, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with. A couple of notable names are Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top analyst AI stock picks, we ranked the top 35 holdings of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF by their average analyst share price target upside and selected the top AI stocks.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Nvidia (NVDA) reached $905.54, with a -1.72% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.13%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.08%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.1%.\n\nShares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 5.75% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 0.89% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.35%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 22, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.49, showcasing a 403.67% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $24.17 billion, indicating a 236.08% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05 billion, representing changes of +84.72% and +74.07%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Nvidia. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Nvidia is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 38.49. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 23.1, so one might conclude that Nvidia is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nMeanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 1.24.

        "content": "George Soros' Ex-Employee Just Sold A Large Nvidia Stake: DruckenMiller Says It Was A 'Hell Of A Run'\n\nBillionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, who runs the Duquesne Family Office, has tapped the brakes on his Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) investment as he believes the artificial intelligence revolution has gone too far too fast.\n\nWhat To Know: Druckenmiller has been betting on AI for more than a year with positions in Nvidia, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other tech leaders. Recent quarterly filings show that he even bought call options in Nvidia stock to help boost his investment exposure.\n\nTuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Druckenmiller noted that he recently reduced his exposure to Nvidia because of the stock’s incredible surge from around $150 per share to more than $900 per share in just over a year.\n\n“I'm not Warren Buffett,” Druckenmiller said. “I don't own things for 10 or 20 years. I wish I was Warren Buffett.”\n\nThere have been several beneficiaries of the AI boom, but Nvidia is certainly the poster child, as its AI chips have experienced exorbitant demand as other company’s race to train and build their own AI models. Nvidia shares have more than tripled over a one-year period. The stock rallied 238% in 2023 and is already up another 66% year-to-date.\n\nDruckenmiller told CNBC that he initially doubled down on his Nvidia position when Microsoft-backed ChatGPT surged in popularity.\n\n“Even an old guy like me could figure out what that meant,” Druckenmiller said.\n\nCheck This Out: ChatGPT Is Not A ‘Long-Term’ Engagement Model, OpenAI’s Top Executive Says: ‘Today’s Systems Are Laughably Bad’\n\nAt that time, he expected to hold his Nvidia position for at least two or three years as he anticipated that the AI boom was going to be a “mega trend like we’ve never seen” and could potentially be bigger than the internet, he said.\n\n“I just need a break. We’ve had a hell of a run. A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now,” Druckenmiller said.\n\nThe legendary investor noted that he’s still bullish on the prospects of AI longer term. His decision to slash his Nvidia stake was more about the incredible run from $150 to $900 in such a short period of time, he explained.\n\n\"AI could rhyme with the Internet. As we go through all this capital spending we need to do, the payoff, while it's incrementally coming in by the day, the big payoff might be four to five years from now. So AI might be a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term,” Druckenmiller said.\n\nNVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares were down 0.76% at $914.13 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.\n\nImage generated using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article George Soros' Ex-Employee Just Sold A Large Nvidia Stake: DruckenMiller Says It Was A 'Hell Of A Run' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly tumbled today, falling as much as 10.7% early in the trading session, but recovered those losses throughout the morning to finish the session down just 1.7%.\n\nThe catalyst for the movement was comments from famed billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat did Druckenmiller say about Nvidia?\n\nIn an interview on CNBC this morning, Druckenmiller, who had an impeccable record running the Duquesne Capital Management fund for nearly 30 years, said he'd cut his Nvidia stake in late March.\n\nDruckenmiller argued that it was time to take profits in the stock, saying, \"A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now.\"\n\nThe former hedge fund titan was early to recognize Nvidia's potential in the generative AI boom as his Duquesne Family Office moved aggressively into Nvidia stock in the fourth quarter of 2022 when ChatGPT launched.\n\nDruckenmiller began selling his Nvidia stake in Q4, though that looks premature in retrospect as the AI stock surged again in this year's Q1.\n\nWe'll learn how much of his Nvidia stake he cut when 13F reports come in over the next week.\n\nWhy Nvidia stock bounced back\n\nThere was no particular catalyst for the recovery in Nvidia stock. Shares seemed to gain as some investors believed the sharp decline to be a buying opportunity.\n\nDruckenmiller wasn't particularly bearish on Nvidia and expressed long-term optimism for AI, but he seemed content to take profits as the stock has surged since he first began buying.\n\nWhile we're unlikely to see more multibagging returns from Nvidia as the company is now worth more than $2 trillion, the stock could continue to outperform. We'll learn more when Nvidia reports Q1 earnings later this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Given the rapid rise in AI relevancy, many have argued that AI stocks are currently in a bubble similar to the Dot-Com bubble in the 2000s. However, the main difference between the two eras is that most dot-com companies weren’t actually producing any real products or services. On the other hand, AI stocks have legitimate revenue-driving products. And, they have the ability to boost the productivity and efficiency of other strong existing businesses.\n\nSo are all AI stocks worth buying right now? Definitely not. In a bubble-like environment, many stocks will be overvalued. Currently, AI is the tide that is raising all boats.\n\nLet’s examine the three best AI stocks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META)  In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is an American technology company that was founded by its current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg. It’ best known for apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, which have over 3.2 billion daily active users. In April, 55 of the 62 analyst recommendations were a buy or strong buy rating for the stock. The average price target is $480.13 with a street-high target of $552.50.\n\nAt the center of Meta’s AI research is its Llama 3 large language model. This is Meta’s answer to OpenAI’s GPT and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Gemini platform. The main difference is that Llama 3 is completely open-source and free for both commercial and personal users. As META moves to integrate its intelligent assistant into many of its products, investors should expect Meta’s market dominance to continue.\n\nAs for its financials, although Meta had a quick meltdown after its recent earnings, its recovery has swiftly been going underway. Shares are trading at a reasonable 8.3x sales and 22.8x forward earnings. Revenue-wise, Meta’s ten-year revenue CAGR of 32% puts it an edge above its peers like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nFounded in 2012, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is an American cloud-computing company. The stock held its IPO in September 2020 in what was one of the most anticipated debuts in Wall Street history. Even still, Snowflake has a ton of potential upside with a street-high price target of $600.00. Its average target of $219.71 represents a nearly 40% upside from its current price.\n\nSo how is Snowflake an AI stock? Snowflake’s data warehousing and analytics platform is essential to building AI solutions for specific companies and businesses. Think of it as a pick-and-shovel play for AI rather than a business that directly develops AI technology. Also, SNOW has become well known for its large language model called “Arctic”. It helps deliver enterprise solutions like coding and development with breakthrough efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, its stock has seen a sell-off resulting from a combination of a weak forecast and overall uncertainty surrounding its sudden change in CEO. At these depressed prices, shares are now trading at 18.6x sales, a historically cheap point for SNOW. Assuming a reversion to the mean, now is a great opportunity to take advantage of the recent negative sentiment around Snowflake.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is an American data analytics firm that was founded in 2003 and specializes in empowering enterprises with its big data analytics. Wall Street analysts have a wide range of price targets for PLTR. These targets range from as low as $5.00 to as high as $35.00 with an average price target of $23.33.\n\nThis company is well known for its enterprise software platforms that help to digest and analyze large sets of data. Palantir recently partnered with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to provide AI solutions to both commercial and government clients. Moreover, CEO Alex Karp recently stated that demand for its AIP AI-based platform has been unprecedented. PLTR’s commitment to signing new contracts has helped it establish itself as an emerging leader in the AI data analytics sector. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Palantir’s valuation has always been the bear thesis for the stock. Even with the recent growth, shares trade at 24x sales and 75x forward earnings. Nonetheless, Palantir has finally become profitable and has seen a sharply rising revenue CAGR over the past three years. So, with its emergence as a major AI player, Palantir could be on the verge of a hyper-growth phase in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The technology industry has been booming, especially over the last year. This is primarily due to the increased attention surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI) and similar technologies. The production of semiconductors is crucial to the development of innovative technologies.\n\nAlong with being vital to technological advancement, semiconductors are just as important to our everyday lives. They make our smartphones, cars and computers function.\n\nA few stocks within the semiconductor industry share impressive price appreciation and offer strong long-term growth potential. Let’s explore some great options for investors seeking to gain exposure to this burgeoning industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) primarily sells cleaning equipment for integrated circuits. It also provides electrochemical plating and thermal deposition services.\n\nOver this past year, its share price has increased by 175%. That was primarily due to its most recent earnings results, which greatly exceeded analysts’ expectations.\n\nOn Feb. 28, ACM Research released its Q4 earnings of full year 2023. It stated that total revenue increased by 57% to $170 million. And earnings per share more than doubled from nineteen cents per share to forty-three cents year-over-year (YOY).\n\nDirectly following this earnings report, ACMR’s stock price increased by over 40% because it beat analysts’ predictions for revenue and earnings per share by a fair margin.\n\nACMR provided revenue estimates for the full year 2024 of between $650 million and $725 million. In addition, the total revenue for the full year 2023 was $558 million.\n\nRecently, the company released preliminary unaudited revenue and shipment results for the Q1 of 2024. It revealed that revenue and shipments are expected to increase by 103% to 105% and 163% to 165% YOY, respectively.\n\nTherefore, ACMR is a sturdy buy semiconductor company that draws in investors due to its healthy growth metrics.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a leading producer of semiconductor devices used in smartphones, high-performance computing and other electronics.\n\nOn Apr. 18, TSM reported Q1 earnings of 2024. The total revenue increased by 17% and net income rose by 9%. And, it announced expected earnings for Q4 of 2024, with anticipated revenue between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also experiencing impressive share price appreciation. For example, within the last year, it has increased by 67%.\n\nMoreover, TSM has benefited due to the influx of investors’ attention towards generative AI. The company offers investors impressive growth capabilities. And it anticipates a strong growth rate over the next several years, particularly within its high computing and automotive segments.\n\nOffering solid growth metrics, TSM is the second largest company in the sector by market cap behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nImpinj (PI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) uses its wide array of integrated circuit technology to provide a cloud connectivity platform. Its applications include industries such as retail, logistics, healthcare and industrials.\n\nOver the past year, Impinj’s share price has increased by 73%, primarily due to a positive earnings report for the first quarter. This has investors rushing to buy shares.\n\nOn Apr. 24, PI dropped earnings results for Q1 of 2024. That showed a net loss of $4 million for Q1 2023 was reported. And for Q1 2024, it increased to net income of $33 million. Total revenue decreased by 10% YOY. This year’s second quarter outlook expects total revenue to range between $96 million and $99 million.\n\nDespite experiencing a decrease in total revenue YOY, Impinj still beat analysts’ expectations for first quarter earnings. And that sent the stock price higher by nearly 30%.\n\nThus, Impinj is a strong semiconductor stock buy that investors should keep their eye on. With projected revenue for Q2 improving over Q1, expect share price appreciation.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era",
        "content": "Dear fellow investors,\n\nAt the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) Annual Meeting we marked what we believe is the end of an era both for Berkshire and for the S&P 500 Index. In Berkshire's case it is the loss of Charlie Munger and the passing of the baton from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) to his well-prepared team. In the case of the index it is the rhymes surrounding the past major peaks in stock market euphoria and what Munger and Buffett have said publicly.\n\nBuffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting over the weekend that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a great deal of good and a great deal of evil in the form of scamming. The video of Charlie saying that a euphoria episode is like a chain letter or a Ponzi scheme and when it gets combined with a legitimate development, like the internet, it is like combining raisins and turds. You still end up with turds! We believe that AI is a legitimate development, but it is coming at the late stages of the fourth euphoria episode of the last 100 years (1929, 1969, 1999 and 2021).\n\nAt Smead Capital Management, we believe investors are going to be extremely negatively impacted by the hangover from the euphoric emergence of AI. The reason lies in the historical behavior of the stock market in relation to major life-changing technology. History shows that the stock market benefits of technological advances come 10 years after the original excitement.\n\nRadio changed everyone's life between 1923 and 1941. One percent of U.S. households had a radio in 1923, and by 1937, that number grew to 75% household penetration. In 1941, the most famous radio address was conducted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said, \"December 7, 1941, is a day that will live in infamy!\" The U.S. declared War against the Axis powers.\n\nRCA was the largest maker of radios, one of two large national radio broadcasters and one of two large radio content producers. As is the case for new technologies in the investing world, RCA saw a blistering gain between 1925 and 1929 in what is referred to as the Roaring 1920s: Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nHowever, from October 1929 to May 1941, you would've lost over 80% of your investment in RCA. Eventually, from 1941 to 1968, RCA was spectacular!\n\nMany new technologies were spurred forward by the space race from 1955 to 1969. Television's popularity exploded and business use of computers (IBM) contributed to a euphoric stock market era called the Go-Go 1960s. T. Rowe Price and Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) pivoted away from stocks by shifting to inflation hedges like oil, commodities and gold (Price) and giving his partners cash back in 1969 (Buffett). Buffett said in early 1969 that \"investors had moved from lethargy ten years before to acute hypertension at the end of 1968. This era ended on the two-year bull market led by 24 stocks in the two Nifty-Fifty lists at Morgan Guaranty and Kidder Peabody. Stocks didn't get attractive at the S&P 500 Index level until 1982. Here is how the market treated shares of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Coke (NYSE:KO) from the end of 1972 to the end of 1982:\n\nStory continues Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nJump ahead to the late 1990s euphoria related to the introduction of the internet and the mania tied to it which did change our lives. Tech stocks soared in 1998-1999, just like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has in the last two years. This was despite a severe Fed tightening cycle by then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan who could see that a financial euphoria episode had developed. He called it \"irrational exuberance in 1997! Like Charlie Munger just called it turds! Here is how Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) traded from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002, as two of the most popular ways to participate in the legitimate development called the internet: Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nThis time, the stock market believes the AI phenomena will change our lives as it elongates the financial euphoria episode that Munger called, in November of 2021, \"the biggest euphoria episode of his career!\" Again, Munger had been through the Go-Go 1960s and the DotCom bubble. We are advising extreme caution for investors who fear stock market failure. This chart of low dividend stocks relative to high dividend stocks does a good job of showing where we are compared to 1969 and late 1999: Buffett and Munger Mark the End of an Era\n\nHere is why we are extremely cautious: Like the prior euphoria episodes, the AI craze has hit the stock market like wildfire. Investors feel like it is a train they must catch, even if it gets severely interrupted at some point. It is, as Munger says, \"a legitimate business development.\" However, it is coming toward the end of a massive euphoria episode in stocks that is strong enough to withstand a 500-basis point Federal Reserve tightening and a tech bear market in 2022. Therefore, the raisins of AI are intertwined with the financial euphoria turds!\n\nAs responsible fiduciaries and stock pickers, we must defend our capital until this euphoria gets purged through severe losses in the S&P 500 Index, which is \"all twisted up\" in the euphoria of this era. Join us in patiently waiting through the last phases of the euphoria and the bargains that we believe could be available to us as a result. Lastly, recognize that we are close to the end of an era.\n\nFear Stock Market Failure.\n\nThe information contained in this missive represents Smead Capital Management's opinions and should not be construed as personalized or individualized investment advice and are subject to change.

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 has been on a tear. The tech-heavy index is up 37% over the past 12 months compared to a 26% gain by the S&P 500 and a 17% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But what goes up must come down. And as any investor who remembers 2022 knows, the reversal can be quick and sharp. The Nasdaq 100 lost 33% of its value that year.\n\nOf course, the bull market ride since then has been phenomenal. Tech stocks have carried the index to a 63% gain, so there’s no reason to fear a market crash. It’s just the next phase before a new run higher that washes away all the pain of the downturn.\n\nBut if you want to survive a crash in fine form, the three companies below are Nasdaq 100 crash-resistant stocks that should protect your downside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock\n\nA market crash might impede Booking Holdings’ (NASDAQ:BKNG) growth trajectory as travel demand ebbed, but this global travel giant has geographic diversification that would minimize a full collapse.\n\nIn virtually every country around the world, Booking has developed a leading network of hotel properties and services. It has achieved a critical mass that attracts more travelers looking for rooms, rentals, attractions, flights, and a payment platform.\n\nBooking Holdings also possesses a first-mover status in certain regions, such as Asia, which gives it a competitive edge over rivals trying to break into these markets. In China, its partnerships with Trip.com (NASDAQ:TCOM), Meituan-Dianping (OTCMKTS:MPNGF) and ride-sharing app Didi Chuxing give it a leg up as does its own Agoda.com portal. It is difficult and expensive for rivals to build the same sort of network that Booking has established.\n\nWith an equally extensive relationship with proprietors in Europe, the online travel agent offers investors downside protection in case of a crash.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is finding its groove as data center demand for artificial intelligence (AI) creates a burgeoning market. While Marvell’s leadership in electro-optical chips will be its mainstay of growth and profitability, the chipmaker also opened up a new avenue for growth in custom accelerators.\n\nMarvell recently announced its third hyperscale cloud customer for its custom chip business. It proves the chipmaker’s pivot to data center infrastructure positions the company for long-term growth as the market has a runway for significant expansion. Wall Street believes Marvell has won Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google as customers. They are impressed with its ability to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and, of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in delivering superlative networking chip performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chipmaker forecasts AI revenue will double this year and then double for several years. It expects to generate $2.6 billion in AI sales by 2026. And because it offers a broad catalog of switches, processors and optical chips, Marvell Technology can arguably gain significant market share.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a Nasdaq 100 market crash, having Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in your portfolio would provide sufficient ballast to keep the whole thing afloat. As a cheap form of at-home entertainment, movie streaming can’t be beat. As one of the very few that has proved it can do so profitably, Netflix is quickly becoming one of the last-man-standing providers.\n\nThe market is already giving investors a bit of a discount on the stock after it knocked Netflix shares back 10% following earnings.\n\nAlthough the streamer added even more subscribers to the platform, its forecast for deceleration in the second half of 2024 caused the market to pause its incredible run-up. Over the past year, shares nearly doubled. The platform has over 81 million subscribers in North America, making it a very mature market that is not likely to see much more growth. That’s especially true after converting millions to paying members following a password-sharing crackdown. Still, there is plenty of growth available internationally.\n\nHowever, what the past four years have shown is that operating a streaming business is not as easy as Netflix made it look. Not even Disney (NYSE:DIS) has found the formula for making money at it, while Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is desperately seeking a buyer.\n\nNetflix is a solid business that has endured an onslaught of competition. Waiting them out was difficult but has paid off for Netflix and its shareholders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Immersion Corporation IMMR is slated to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 8.\n\nFor the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.9 million, indicating a 252.8% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s $7.07 million.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 59 cents per share, suggesting a significant improvement from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 25 cents.\n\nIMMR’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 62%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nImmersion Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nImmersion Corporation price-eps-surprise | Immersion Corporation Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nImmersion’s first-quarter 2024 performance is expected to have benefited from strong demand for a wide range of technologies and licenses that the company provides in the haptic space.\n\nIMMR’s deep expertise in IP and haptic, as well as the authorized distribution through technology licenses, patents, services, reference designs and software development kits are likely to have aided the company’s performance\n\nIts operations across multiple segments, including its partnerships with Original Equipment Manufacturers like Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Sony and Panasonic in the mobile, gaming, wearables and consumer electronics are expected to have boosted Immersion’s top line. The company is likely to have benefited from its association with industry giants like Stanley, Nippon Seiki, Elan Microelectronics and Wacom.\n\nThe company is expected to have benefited from the rising AR/VR space that is experiencing the growing use of haptics. According to a markets and markets report, the global AR/VR market is estimated to grow from $32.5 billion in 2023 to $77.5 billion in 2028, with a CAGR of 19%. Besides its application in AR/VR gaming, haptic technology is also used in medical training, automotive, report operations, engineering and military. The application of haptics across so many fields is expected to have positively impacted IMMR’s revenues.\n\nImmersion’s performance is expected to have gained from the renewal of contracts with industry giants. In the first quarter, the company signed license agreements with Nintendo, Razer, Morterex and Meta.\n\nThe company has also licensed its patents to third party gaming accessory makers to use its patents in high-end spinning mass and force feedback devices.\n\nThese include controllers, steering wheels and joysticks designed for PC platforms like Microsoft Windows, as well as gaming consoles from Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.\n\nStory continues\n\nImmersion primarily focuses on tactile haptics that provide advantages over the manufacturers of force feedback haptics. Expensive force-feedback haptic devices have extremely limited scope in haptic technology market compared with tactile ones. This factor is also expected to have contributed to Immersion’s performance.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Immersion Corporation this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nSoundHound is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its conversational AI platform, owing to the increasing popularity of generative AI and large language models.\r\n\r\nThe demand for AI-driven customer service solutions, particularly in the restaurant and auto sectors, is expected to have remained a key factor in driving SOUN’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nSoundHound's offerings, such as Smart Ordering, Employee Assist, and Smart Answering, cater to this demand and are expected to have contributed to revenue growth in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nSoundHound's Pillar 1 strategy, emphasizing partnerships and growth in sectors such as automotive on the back of collaboration with NVIDIA NVDA, is expected to have been a significant contributor to revenue growth in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nIn March, SoundHound AI introduced an in-vehicle voice assistant powered by a large language model on the NVIDIA Drive platform, offering real-time and generative AI capabilities for seamless responses without cloud connectivity, transforming driver experiences. This partnership is expected to have boosted SOUN’s clientele.\r\n\r\nClients like Olo OLO and Oracle ORCL leverage SOUN’s voice AI solutions to enhance their offerings in the restaurant landscape. This is likely to have strengthened SOUN’s position in the conversational AI space during the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, SOUN announced the integration of its Smart Ordering voice AI technology with Oracle MICROS Symphony point-of-sale (POS) for restaurants.

        "title": "12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments.\n\nTom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented:\n\n“A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.”\n\nCurrently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the \"size effect\". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs.\n\nSome of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\nA close-up image of a stock market graph displaying the growth of the company's mutual funds.\n\nBest Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\n12. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 69.29%\n\nFirst Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Growth Index. It seeks to achieve similar investment outcomes in terms of both price and yield, excluding fees and expenses. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)’s net expense ratio stands at 0.60% as of December 1, 2023. As of May 2, 2024, the fund’s net assets exceed $1 billion, and its portfolio comprises 187 holdings, excluding cash. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to monitor.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top holdings of First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC). According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds held stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with a stake worth $1.88 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a popular stock among elite hedge funds.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top Q1 contributors were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Shockwave Medical and Spotify. Chipotle’s combination of superior quality and speed of service has created a strong brand affinity, and the company is currently expanding its store count at a growth rate of 8%–10% annually. With each restaurant generating an annual income of around 60% of its original investment cost, the implied payback period is less than two years. Given these attractive economics, we believe a long runway remains for market penetration potential. Next, increased accessibility and convenience have been a strategic priority, leading it to add secondary “make lines” that enable each store to meet increased demand from third-party delivery services and the company’s own digital pickup lanes (“Chipotlanes”). And last, evidence is emerging that the company’s post-COVID training initiatives (“the four pillars of throughput”) are resulting in higher peak-time productivity. Overall, the profit cycle remains nicely in motion, and the stock remains a large CropSM holding.”\n\n11. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 81.23%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 11th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) aims to replicate the performance of S&P 900 Growth Index, which consists of large and mid-cap US stocks known for their growth potential.

According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was found in 302 hedge fund portfolios, with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holding the biggest stake in the company, comprising 38.2 million shares worth $14.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company’s new GenAI personal assistant.”\n\n10. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 82.91%\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is placed 10th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) seeks to replicate the performance of S&P 500(R) Growth Index, which is composed of large-cap US stocks known for their growth potential.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global consumer electronics and software company that designs and markets mobile communications devices (iPhones), personal computers (Macs), multi-purpose tablets (iPads), and wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods, and Accessories). The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock’s underperformance during the quarter was due to fears that the company’s slowing top-line growth and increased competitive threats make the stock’s premium valuation harder to justify.”\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 83.73%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Growth Index. Its primary objective is to closely mirror the returns of this index, which is considered a benchmark for overall US growth stock performance. The ETF was established on September 7, 2010. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) features an expense ratio of 0.10% and its portfolio comprises 228 stocks. As of March 31, 2024, VOOG’s net assets came in at $10.3 billion.\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG). As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was found in 173 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 180 in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is one of the largest stakeholders of NVIDIA, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.88 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\n8. iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 92.31%\n\niShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG) seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth Index, consisting of US equities with growth traits from both large and mid-cap categories.

Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 41.78 million shares worth $6.34 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 94.88%\n\nFidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) strives to mirror the price and yield performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a weighted index reflecting the market capitalization of stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs, ranking 7th on our list. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) was launched on September 9, 2003.

(NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\n6. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 100.46%\n\nNuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) ranks 6th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) follows a passive management strategy, investing primarily in large-cap US equity securities displaying growth characteristics and meeting required environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) was part of 166 hedge fund portfolios at the conclusion of December 2023, up from 163 in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of Alphabet, with a position worth $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top growth plays on the radar of smart investors.\n\nPalm Valley Capital Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Governments have various irons in the fire for curbing (commandeering?) the power of tech titans, with the European Union rolling out the Digital Markets Act, the Federal Trade Commission suing Amazon for illegally using monopoly power, and the DOJ lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advertising business going to trial in September.\n\nFurthermore, the dominant technology enterprises are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot. Google’s botched launch of its AI model, Gemini, shows the risk of having too much money. You lose discipline. A Pirate Wires exposé into the firm’s culture revealed that employees went to extreme lengths to intentionally degrade the quality of the AI engine’s output for ideological reasons. Try that as a small business!

        "content": "ACM Research ACMR is set to report its first-quarter 2024 results on May 8.\r\n\r\nThe company has been benefiting from its multi-product portfolio and growing customer base. Its strengthening foothold across international markets like the United States, Europe and Korea, strong China localization trend, increasing mature node investment in China, and new product cycles have been driving top-line growth.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strong market position across the semiconductor end market on the back of its differentiated technology is expected to have continued boosting its revenue growth during the first quarter.\r\n\r\nThe growing demand for the company's chiplet designs, driven by the rising AI trend, is expected to have aided it in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the booming advanced packaging market. Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the advanced packaging market is expected to hit $32.64 billion in 2024 and reach $45 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.6% during the forecast period of 2024-2029.\r\n\r\nThe increasing adoption of its flagship SAPS Tahoe and TEBO single-wafer cleaning products, driven by growing demand for single-wafer cleaning tools across various sectors, is expected to have bolstered the company’s overall performance in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Electrochemical Plating (ECP), Furnace and other technologies segment on the back of its patented plating technologies like multi-zone anodes for superior uniformity control, rubber-seal plating chucks for superior sealing, and vacuum pre-wetting of wafers, is likely to have acted as a tailwind for the company in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across evaluation tools, including its Track and Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) platforms, is likely to have driven top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nContinuous recovery of shipment delays is expected to have positively impacted the total shipment growth during the quarter under review. For the first quarter, the company expects total shipments to be in the range of $235-$240 million, indicating year-over-year growth in the band of 163%-169%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the negative impacts of U.S.-China trade policies are expected to have been a major concern.\r\n\r\nFurther, changes in the spending patterns of key customers and supply-chain constraints are likely to have hurt top-line growth during the first quarter.\n\nACM Research, Inc.

The central banks will win there and the cost will be a slower economy,\" said Hal Reynolds, chief investment officer at Los Angeles Capital Management.\n\n\"That will happen sometime later this year or early next year and these rate cuts will come. But there is still a fair bit of noise. I don't think things are much clearer today than they were two months ago.\"\n\nTraders currently anticipate rate cuts of 45 basis points (bps) from the Fed by the end of 2024, according to LSEG's interest rate probabilities app, with the first pivot to rate cut priced in for September and another in December.\n\nInvestors will keep an eye on Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari's speech later in the day. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Monday finishing the battle against inflation will likely require a hit to demand, while his New York counterpart John Williams said that at some undefined point the U.S. central bank will lower its interest rate target.\n\nAt 8:33 a.m. ET, S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.03%. Nasdaq 100 e-minis slipped 30.75 points, or 0.17%, while Dow e-minis climbed 19 points, or 0.05%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe earnings season has been largely supportive for markets. Of the nearly four-fifth of the S&P 500 companies that reported first-quarter results through Friday, 76.8% topped analysts' profit estimates, as per LSEG data. In a typical quarter, 67% beat earnings estimates.\n\nKenvue gained 3.6% after the Band-Aid maker beat first-quarter profit estimates and said it would cut 4% of its global workforce.\n\nNvidia fell 0.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was developing its own chip to run artificial intelligence (AI) software in data centers.\n\nApple gained 0.9% ahead of an event later on Tuesday where it is expected to unveil new iPads.\n\nTesla fell 1.8% after data showed the U.S. automaker sold 62,167 China-made electric vehicles in April, down 18% from a year earlier.\n\nPalantir Technologies tumbled 11.4% after the data analytics firm's annual revenue forecast fell short of analysts' estimates.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $5.49 per share, indicating a change of +403.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.94 points to a change of +84.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.26 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $24.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +236.1%. The $106.05 billion and $125.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +74.1% and +17.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $22.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +265.3%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.82%. The EPS surprise was +13.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Nvidia a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute & Networking.\r\n\r\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\r\n\r\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $201,950.68, or a gain of 20,095.07%, as of May 7, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 177.38% and the price of gold increased 70.50% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 29.1% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.75%, and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Alert: 3 Must-Buy Robotics Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "As the stock market weathers a temporary decline, savvy investors are looking for robotics stocks to buy. Wall Street recently closed out a challenging month with major indexes seeing substantial drops. The S&P 500 finished the month of April down by 1.6%, marking its first monthly loss in six months. This downturn was primarily driven by increasing concerns over persistently high inflation and interest rates.\n\nHowever, despite the short-term challenges, the market potential for robotics remains enormous. The global robotics technology market is projected to surpass $283 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 14.7%. Some factors driving this growth include increasing investments in technology, especially in vehicle production, and the rising demand for industrial and service robots.\n\nAs the robotics industry continues to innovate and expand, it offers strategic opportunities for long-term gains, especially when market volatility causes prices to dip. Hence, here are three must-buy robotics stocks that savvy investors should consider when prices plunge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSymbotic (SYM) a computer rendering of Miso Robotics's \"Flippy\" robot\n\nSource: Miso Robotics\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) has positioned itself as a leading player in the warehouse automation sector. The company leverages robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize supply chain logistics.

These robots operate in high-density storage aisles, guided by a sophisticated software platform that orchestrates their movement and task assignments.\n\nSymbotic’s financials reflect a promising growth story. The company generated $369 million in revenue during Q1 2024, an impressive 79% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA stood at $14 million, compared to a loss of $16 million in the same period last year.\n\nSymbotic’s recent upgrade to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Xavier chips has improved its AI capabilities, enabling its robots to handle boxes with greater precision. The company’s CEO, Rick Cohen, mentioned during the earnings call that the company’s flagship robot, Symbot, delivers better efficiency and reliability than previous bots. It improves deployment speed and expands market reach.\n\nSYM stock is down 17% year-to-date (YTD). However, analysts remain bullish and have an average price target of $54.8 on the stock. This presents a potential 33.3% upside in the near term.\n\niRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum cleaner robots powerful cleaning system with intelligent sensors to clean Pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and daily dust\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is a pioneer in the robotic vacuum industry. iRobot’s cutting-edge technologies, such as Imprint Technology, AI and computer vision, enhances the overall cleaning experience. The company is currently a turnaround story hinging on balancing cost reduction with continued innovation.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, iRobot Corporation reported revenue of $307 million, marking a 14% YoY decline. The company’s gross margins fell to 19%, driven by sluggish consumer spending and aggressive competition. Interim CEO Glen Weinstein outlined the company’s restructuring plan designed to stabilize operations amid current challenges. The key aspects of the plan include simplifying the cost structure, building a sustainable business model and focusing on core value drivers like leveraging the iRobot brand and innovative products.\n\nThe company’s stock has not done well in 2024. However, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and have an average price target of $13. This leaves room for a 37% upside in the near term.\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is at the forefront of robotic process automation and artificial intelligence. The company boasts over 10,000 customers globally, ranging from software developers to large corporations. Its automation platform provides tools like a visual workflow designer and AI-powered document processing.\n\nA critical driver of UiPath’s growth has been the buzz surrounding AI, especially since the launch of ChatGPT. As companies prioritize AI-based transformation, UiPath has effectively upsold its RPA products to existing customers while attracting new ones.\n\nUiPath reported strong financial results for Q4 2024, exceeding both top and bottom-line guidance. The company achieved $405 million in revenue, marking a 31% YoY increase. The quarter also marked UiPath’s first GAAP profitable quarter, with a record 27% non-GAAP operating margin.\n\nThe stock continues to do well and is up 45% over the past one year. Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and have an average price target of $27.9. This leaves room for a 43.1% upside in the near term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Buy These 2 Hypergrowth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent of the internet completely changed the growth arc for corporate America. Since then, countless next-big-thing investments have come and gone with moderate success. However, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) may be the first game-changing innovation that gives the advent of the internet a run for its money.\n\nWith AI and machine learning, software and systems are able to learn and evolve without human intervention. The ability to become more proficient at their tasks, as well as learn new tasks, gives AI systems utility in most sectors and industries. It's the likely catalyst behind PwC's otherworldly estimate that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDespite this eye-popping figure, history tells us that not every company will benefit from a next-big-thing innovation. Although Wall Street and investors are absolutely enamored with semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), two hypergrowth AI stocks look like considerably smarter buys right now.\n\nThe infrastructure foundation of the AI movement may be in a massive bubble\n\nOn the surface, it's easy to see why investors have flocked to Nvidia since 2023 began. Last year, the company's Data Center segment sales surged 217% to $47.5 billion, with its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) leading the charge. In particular, Nvidia's H100 chips are the preferred choice of businesses wanting to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\n\nNvidia has also benefited from AI-GPU scarcity. Whereas Nvidia recorded 126% net sales growth across all segments in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), its cost of revenue rose by only 43%. This is a pretty clear indication that phenomenal pricing power for its in-demand GPUs drove the bulk of this sales growth.\n\nBut don't expect this superior pricing power to last much longer. As the company increases its own production of A100 and H100 chips, and new entrants enter the AI-accelerated data center space, high-powered GPU scarcity is going to decline. Nvidia's pricing power will probably weaken in the quarters to come.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is unlikely to see successively larger orders from members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" after this year. Its top four customers make up around 40% of its net revenue, and they're all developing their own GPUs. Over time, this should lessen the reliance of the Magnificent Seven stocks on Nvidia's infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the biggest concern of all might just be that every next-big-thing trend and innovation dating back 30 years has navigated its way through an early innings bubble. Professional and everyday investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption and uptake of new innovations. It's highly unlikely that AI is going to be the exception, and arguably no company is more directly exposed to a bubble-bursting event than Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead of going against history, the following two supercharged AI growth stocks look like genius buys. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first high-octane AI stock that makes for a considerably smarter buy than Nvidia is social media colossus Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta happens to be one of Nvidia's \"top four customers\" I alluded to earlier that's developing its own AI chips.\n\nAside from developing in-house AI-GPUs, Meta is deploying generative AI solutions in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most notable is as a tool to help advertisers tailor their message(s) to individual users.\n\nIf the AI bubble were to burst, Meta would be able to navigate the storm with minimal risk to its operating performance. That's because almost 98% of the company's revenue can be traced to advertising. In other words, all that really matters to Meta's near-term operating results is how healthy the U.S. and global economy are.\n\nThough there are select predictive indicators and money-based metrics that suggest the U.S. economy could fall into a recession in the not-too-distant future, history shows that periods of growth last significantly longer than downturns. For patient investors, the ad-driven model that Meta offers continues to pay off.\n\nMeta owns a number of the most-visited social sites globally, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger. Collectively, its family of apps helped lure 3.24 billion daily active users to its platforms in the March-ended quarter, and close to 4 billion monthly active users as of the end of December. This makes it the clear go-to for advertisers, which should support substantial ad-pricing power over the long run.\n\nAnother reason investors can confidently buy Meta stock is its pristine balance sheet. Meta closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated more than $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations. It has more than enough capital to continue to tackle its metaverse and AI ambitions without adversely impacting its foundational advertising cash cow.\n\nMeta is currently valued at just 12 times consensus cash flow estimates for 2025, which represents an 18% discount to its trailing-five-year average multiple to cash flow.\n\nSentinelOne\n\nA second hypergrowth artificial intelligence stock that investors can confidently buy instead of Nvidia is endpoint cybersecurity solutions provider SentinelOne(NYSE: S).\n\nSentinelOne's security platform, known as Singularity, relies on AI and machine learning to become more efficient at autonomously recognizing and responding to potential threats across all system processes.\n\nOne of the many beauties of cybersecurity is that it's no longer an optional service. Businesses of any size that have an online or cloud-based presence need to protect their data from robots and hackers that don't take time off. Increasingly, the onus of this protection is falling to third-party providers, like SentinelOne.\n\nThough Wall Street was less than thrilled with SentinelOne's full-year sales guidance of $812 million to $818 million -- the consensus forecast was for $818 million -- when it was issued in March, the midpoint of the company's guidance still implies 31% year-over-year growth. There's a real possibility this company could catapult from a reported $621 million in sales in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31, 2024) to north of $2 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029.\n\nAside from growing at a lightning-quick pace, SentinelOne is benefiting from its subscription-driven operating model. As of the end of fiscal 2024, its annualized recurring revenue (ARR) jumped by 39% to $724.4 million. Subscriptions provide the company with predictable cash flow, which has led to a juicy adjusted gross margin that's closing in on 80%. Recurring profitability shouldn't be too far off.\n\nFurthermore, SentinelOne is landing bigger fish. The number of customers generating at least $100,000 in ARR for the company jumped 30% to 1,133 last year, with a dollar-based net retention rate of 115% among these clients. In short, its larger customers are spending an average of 15% more from the previous year.\n\nOnce SentinelOne reaches recurring profitability, the sky could be the limit for its share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AMD Stock: Investors Needed More Than Just a Solid Quarter",
        "content": "On paper, semiconductor stalwart Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) produced a reasonably solid report for the first quarter. However, the company is competing against technology juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in multiple advanced arenas, most notably artificial intelligence. Therefore, investors needed more than just a solid print. Unfortunately, the generative AI space may be overhyped, warranting a cautious approach. Therefore, I am bearish on AMD stock.\n\nHitting Certain Right Notes Wasn’t Enough for AMD Stock\n\nWhen looking at Advanced Micro’s Q1 earnings results without broader context, it appears that the company did enough to assuage its shareholders. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 62 cents, which the company met. On the top line, experts projected sales of $5.47 billion. Instead, the tech firm posted $5.48 billion. Further, as TipRanks reporter Vince Condarcuri mentioned, the revenue tally represented a 2.2% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNotably, AI-related endeavors undergirded the top-line expansion. “Data Center revenue jumped by 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. The main driver of this segment was AMD’s MI300 AI accelerator. The MI300 is a competitor to Nvidia’s H100 chip and costs about 33% less. It also tends to be better suited for memory-intensive tasks, such as simulations,” wrote Condarcuri.\n\nMoreover, Advanced Micro CEO Dr. Lisa Su mentioned that widespread AI deployment was driving demand. In response, the company ramped up its Data Center business to “enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio.”\n\nLooking ahead to Q2, management believes that revenue will land between $5.4 billion and $6 billion. Analysts previously modeled for sales to reach $5.69 billion. From a bird’s-eye view, the tech giant appeared to be saying the right things. However, investors disagreed, with AMD stock slipping sharply following the earnings report.\n\nHarsh Realities Cloud the Q1 Report\n\nAlthough Advanced Micro delivered many encouraging statistics, Q1 wasn’t a perfect print. In particular, the company suffered from lower revenue in its Gaming and Embedded business unit. Per AMD’s earnings conference call, it disclosed that total revenue declined 11% sequentially because the aforementioned unit offset its data-center-focused GPU sales.\n\nThat’s a problem for two reasons. First, Nvidia represents the clear leader in GPU sales associated with the AI ecosystem. Yes, it’s true that many experts have projected generative AI to command a valuation of $1.3 trillion by 2032. However, the tech arena is not a democracy.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith Nvidia’s technical edge, it’s possible that it can take the lion’s share of the AI hardware market, leaving everybody else fighting for scraps. Since those are expensive scraps, investors may not be in the mood for “good enough.” Conspicuously, while AMD stock is down almost 9% in the trailing month, NVDA is up nearly 5%.\n\nIn other words, Advanced Micro needs to take the fight to Nvidia. Delivering an 11% sequential quarterly revenue decline wasn’t what the market wanted.\n\nSecond and more importantly, AI could be overhyped. While the evolution of AI and machine learning has offered groundbreaking solutions, they’re still works in progress. Last year, Harvard Business Review warned that what it termed the AI hype cycle has been distracting companies. Though AI is undoubtedly a powerful tool, it’s not a miracle worker.\n\nA huge vulnerability regarding AI is that it’s not always accurate. As academic researchers have pointed out, large language models are prone to “hallucinate” – in other words, make stuff up. In certain contexts, the consequences for such false information are rather minimal; perhaps a school teacher gives a failing grade to a student.\n\nHowever, there’s much talk about computers taking over human jobs. Whether we’re talking about legal guidance or accounting or some other service, accuracy is critical. If it turns out that generative AI is incapable of an acceptable level of accuracy, then the whole innovation is rather pointless.\n\nRethinking the Valuation\n\nIf AI’s capabilities are found wanting, then Advanced Micro will need to rely on its other business units to pick up the slack. However, it’s these units that are underperforming, which may be why investors are spooked about AMD stock. The underlying company has too many eggs in one basket, and that basket may undergo a valuation adjustment.\n\nFor Fiscal 2024, analysts, on average, anticipate revenue of $23.88 billion. However, it’s possible that if AI doesn’t live up to the hype, Advanced Micro could hit the lower end of the spectrum, which sits at $22.71 billion.\n\nRight now, AMD stock trades at 10.4x trailing-year revenue. That’s well above the semiconductor sector’s average multiple of 4.05x. Now, let’s just assume the AI industry falters. AMD could find itself trading at an even higher multiple of 10.7x or worse.\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, AMD stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average AMD stock price target is $192.83, implying 23.8% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: AMD Stock Was Good but Not Good Enough\n\nAt first glance, Advanced Micro appeared to deliver satisfactory results for its Q1 earnings report. However, investors were looking for more amid Nvidia’s dominance in the AI space. In addition, AI runs the risk of being overhyped, requiring AMD to shore up its other business units, something it failed to do in the last quarter. With the possibility that the company could suffer a negative valuation adjustment, AMD stock presents risks for investors.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "2023 tax season has come and gone meaning it is time to consider 2024 contributions to your IRA. That will include some mix of Index and mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and individual stocks. The maximum contribution in 2024 is $7,000 for those under 50 years of age and $8,000 for those 50 and older.\n\nWhile most investors will be primarily mixing funds and bonds many will also be picking individual stocks to add to their IRAs. How much money an investor dedicates to individual stocks within an IRA is largely a function of risk tolerance. Generally speaking, the higher that contribution, the more risk and reward it entails.\n\nThat said, let’s look at some of the better individual stocks to choose when considering IRA contribution limits in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is going to be one of the most popular large cap choices in an individual IRA in 2024. Many investors will have exposure to Microsoft through various index funds and ETFs. However, here we’re advocating for purchasing MSFT shares on an individual basis as part of an individual retirement account.\n\nFrankly, investing in Microsoft should be an easy choice. Analysts recommend purchasing Microsoft on a near unanimous basis. It’s generally expected that the value of those shares should rise by between 20% in a base case scenario and by as much as 50% should things rapidly improve.\n\nThere’s plenty of reason to believe in that best case scenario when one looks at the firm’s most recent earnings report from April 25. Revenues grew by 17% and net income increased by 20%. Thus, it’s entirely logical to believe that the value of the stock will rise by 20% moving forward. I like Microsoft because its AI fueled Cloud growth is a particular bright spot. Otherwise, investors should continue to consider Microsoft for its blend of growth and scale that has rarely been rivaled in the past.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealtyIncome (NYSE:O) represents an excellent individual stock choice within an IRA, especially for income-oriented investors. Each share includes a dividend yielding 5.6% paid as a monthly dividend. The beauty of a monthly dividend is that it includes three times as many distributions meaning greater opportunities to compound gains.\n\nRealty Income is also well-positioned defensively. Although the company is very retail oriented, it is highly recession resistant. The vast majority of its tenants operate in recession resistant sectors. That generally includes grocery stores, dollar stores, drugstores and other retail categories that tend to be non-cyclical in nature.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other thing to note about Realty Income is the structure of the leases it signs with its tenants. They tend to be longer, usually on the order of 10 years. Further, the triple net agreements place many of the cost responsibilities on the tenants themselves. That leaves more money for investors and shareholders in the end.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Close-up photo of hands holding glass Coca Cola (KO) bottles, clinking them together. One hand has a bottle opener and is opening a bottle.\n\nSource: BORIMAT PRAOKAEW / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will continue to show up on lists and articles discussing the best stocks to invest in. Whether it’s related to Warren Buffett or defensive positioning and anticipation of a weakening economy, Coca-Cola is generally well regarded.\n\nIt’s that ladder notion – a potential economic weakening – that bears discussion.  A lot of the issue centers around the ongoing fight against inflation. The Federal Reserve has not had as much success in the last few months as it would have liked. That leads some to believe that inflation will be much more persistent than initially believed.\n\nI believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to benefit from that ongoing issue. First of all, Coca-Cola is one of the best defensive stocks there is. It tends to weather economic downturns better than the vast majority of the stock market. Further, consumers continue to buy Coca-Cola products despite higher prices brought on by inflation. In fact, the company raised its guidance for 2024 due to that fact. If inflation will indeed continue to prove more sticky than initially believed, Coca-Cola looks uniquely positioned to thrive regardless.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to deal with a period of stagnation and slowing sales. The news there isn’t all bad by any means. while Apple’s sales and earnings did decline on a year-over-year basis, each also bested guidance.\n\nApple decided to placate investor worries by increasing its share buyback program while simultaneously increasing its dividend by 4%. So, Apple is trying to introduce greater share price stability via more conservative means. The market seems to have appreciated the efforts. However, that is not the only reason to buy Apple at the moment.\n\nThe company remains tight-lipped about its AI plans. CEO Tim Cook is likely to divulge the details about Apple’s AI future at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.\n\nThe best time to have invested in Apple would have been a few days ago before the share buyback announcement. However, all is not lost. Apple’s shares are strengthening again as it appears dedicated to stability. That, along with the potential for a price spike in June suggest that investors should buy in the interim.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s difficult not to like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock at the moment. Aside from the ever persistent threat of anti-monopoly litigation there’s very little to dislike. Amazon has largely avoided that threat for so long that it’s probably better to just ignore it wholesale. Instead, investors should focus on its earnings report and what it says about the company’s future.\n\nSales increased by 13%, rising to $143.3 billion. The company’s Cloud service – Amazon Web Services – continues to thrive. As good as those numbers are, the focus is really all about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company announced a generative AI based assistant intended to speed software development. That AI assistant should be particularly powerful from the perspective that it leverages Amazon’s AWS cloud. The company concurrently announced Bedrock, a fully managed AI service for quickly building and launching applications.\n\nThose developments –  along with strong results – suggest that Amazon is an excellent individual stock choice in any IRA.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to face a bevy of headwinds that have pulled its share prices lower by about 15%. Those headwinds include news that its Blackwell chips might ship later than initially anticipated, disappointing guidance from rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and ongoing concerns regarding when in 2024, if at all, rate cuts will occur.\n\nBuy it anyway because it is one of the best individual stocks to have in your IRA or otherwise. The simple fact remains that until another firm produces better AI chips than Nvidia does, there’s no reason to doubt the company over the mid and long-term. The artificial intelligence boom continues to be the greatest opportunity for investors of this generation.\n\nNvidia dominates demand for the chips that power the AI boom. However, Nvidia’s strengths extend beyond chips alone when it comes to AI. The company is rapidly moving into the artificial intelligence fueled humanoid robots sector. The Project GR00T foundational model is going to be an interesting theme to follow. Nvidia has clearly affected the data center space and may ultimately disrupt the entire economy down to the factory floor.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is arguably the best choice of the top three credit card stocks. Actually, if you follow the returns it’s inarguable that it’s the best. American Express has outperformed Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in 2023. That outperformance spans back more than 5 years and suggests that American Express will continue to outperform its rivals.\n\nThat logically begs the question of why American Express has been able to outperform other credit card stocks. My theory is that it relates to credit worthiness. American Express serves a higher income consumer base which is more credit-worthy. The risk of non-payments and defaults is much lower and as a result AXP shares simply outperform.\n\nFrankly speaking, any of the major three credit card stocks are good choices for the purpose of an IRA investment: each is relatively stable and well exposed to fintech growth opportunities. However, for all of the reasons I just discussed, American Express stands head and shoulders above the other two.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The last 18 months have been very good for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThe exploding demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications since the launch of ChatGPT has pushed big tech companies to snap up Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can make them. That's led to a huge rise in revenue and earnings for the chipmaker, and a commensurate increase in Nvidia's stock price. Shares are up 425% since ChatGPT's launch on November 30, 2022.\n\nBut some of the most influential members of the stock market think Nvidia's run may be overdone. Members of Congress and hedge fund billionaires alike are selling shares of Nvidia and buying two other AI stocks that may have more upside left in them. Should you follow the smart money and drop Nvidia stock? Image source: Nvidia.\n\nWho's selling Nvidia and why?\n\nNvidia has seen a host of sellers on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.\n\nMembers of Congress selling the stock since last October include:\n\nMichael McCaul, Republican Representative from Texas John Curtis, Republican Representative from Utah Ro Khanna, Democrat Representative from California Josh Gottheimer, Democrat Representative from New Jersey Dan Meuser, Republican Representative from Pennsylvania Tom Suozzi, Democrat Representative from New York Dan Newhouse, Republican Representative from Washington\n\nEight prominent billionaires also pared down their positions in Nvidia, according to their most recent filings with the SEC:\n\nIsrael Englander, Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares sold) Jeff Yass, Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares sold) Steven Cohen, Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares sold) David Tepper, Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares sold) Philippe Laffont, Coatue Management (218,839 share sold) Chase Coleman, Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares sold) John Overdeck and David Siegel, Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares sold)\n\nTo be sure, most of these smart money investors aren't completely disposing of their positions in Nvidia. But they are trimming their stakes by a significant amount. And it may be more than just profit taking after Nvidia's incredible price performance.\n\nThere are reasons to believe Nvidia's future isn't as bright as its recent past. For one, the stock valuation remains lofty. Shares trade for over 35x forward earnings expectations. And while Nvidia should see strong demand for the next year or two thanks to several big customers, it's not clear it can sustainably grow earnings at such a rapid pace long-term.\n\nManagement pointed out in its 10-K that one of its customers accounted for 13% of its revenue in fiscal 2024. The concentration of its customer base is a big risk, especially as Nvidia's biggest customers actively working to develop alternative chip designs for their own use. One of Nvidia's biggest advantages right now is its existing relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the leading chip fabricator in the world. As more competing chips go into full-scale manufacturing, demand for Nvidia's chips will fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI chip stock smart money is buying instead\n\nWhile investors on Capitol Hill and Wall Street shed their positions in Nvidia, they've put more of their money into one of Nvidia's biggest rivals in GPU chip design Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nHere are the members of Congress buying shares of AMD:\n\nMichael McCaul, Republican Representative from Texas Josh Gottheimer, Democrat Representative from New Jersey Markwayne Mullin, Republican Representative from Oklahoma\n\nAnd the most prominent billionaires adding AMD to their portfolios:\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen, Viking Global (4,737,399 shares added) Ken Griffin, Citadel Advisors (3,506,881 shares added) Ken Fisher, Fisher Asset Management (570,035 shares added) Philippe Laffont, Coatue Management (23,383 shares added)\n\nAMD has struggled to make progress against Nvidia in its data center GPUs, which are used to train AI models, but that could change soon. It released the MI300X AI accelerator and Instinct MI300A accelerated processing unit in December last year. Still, management's second-quarter sales outlook disappointed investors when it released its first-quarter earnings.\n\nNonetheless, AMD appears poised to grow its share of the AI GPU market over the long run since it's just getting started. And it may have a much bigger opportunity as more companies invest in inference chips. Those are chips needed to actually use AI models after they're trained. The ability to run an AI application on a local device like on a car's computer, for example, is going to be increasingly common. AMD already has several strong relationships with manufacturers there.\n\nAMD's stock isn't cheap, though. Shares trade for an even higher multiple than Nvidia at a forward PE of 41.3x. AMD faces some of the same challenges as Nvidia in ensuring long-term demand for its data center chips. However, its position in the PC marketplace is stable and could present an opportunity as more inference chips come into demand. Importantly, AMD's growth story may just be getting started, while growth may have peaked at Nvidia.\n\nSmart money is moving up the AI food chain\n\nIf there's one company that's benefited nearly as much as Nvidia amid this AI boom, it's Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Since making a $10 billion investment in OpenAI at the start of 2023, Microsoft has positioned itself as a leader in the AI space. Both its enterprise software and its Azure cloud computing platform have benefited as a result.\n\nMembers of Congress and Wall Street have noticed. The following representatives have all bought shares recently:\n\nJosh Gottheimer, Democrat Representative from New Jersey Pete Sessions, Republican Representative from Texas Kathy Manning, Democrat Representative from North Carolina Bill Keating, Democrat Representative from Massachusetts\n\nAt the same time, these Wall Street billionaires added to their positions in the fourth quarter:\n\nKen Fisher, Fisher Asset Management (403,409 shares added) Stanley Druckenmiller, Duquesne Family Office (68,860 shares added) David Tepper, Appaloosa Management (65,000 shares added)\n\nMicrosoft is seeing continued demand for its AI services. Its cloud computing division, Azure, saw sales grow 31% last quarter, far faster than its biggest rivals. Management said growth was driven by demand for AI. In fact, it said, \"near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also seeing strong demand for its Copilot software, which uses generative AI to improve productivity across various fields. As a leader in enterprise software, it sits in an excellent position to sell more subscriptions to its AI software.\n\nMicrosoft's forward PE of 29.8x is still a premium to the overall market. But it's largely in the driver's seat when it comes to its position. No office manager is going to switch from Microsoft's software. Few developers are going to migrate from Azure. Switching costs are high, keeping customers locked in place. That makes Microsoft worthy of the smart money, and perhaps worthy of your money as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Steady Dividend Plays: 3 Aristocrat Stocks to Own Now",
        "content": "On Wall Street, many income-focused investors prioritize long-term stability and reliability over short-term volatility. Enter the Dividend Aristocrat stocks.\n\nThese companies boast a remarkable track record of increasing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Weathering market storms and economic downturns, they consistently reward shareholders with a dependable stream of income.\n\nBut dividend aristocrat stocks offer more than just consistent payouts. They often represent well-established companies with strong fundamentals, healthy balance sheets and a clear path for future growth. Including these reliable dividend payers in your portfolio can provide a valuable source of passive income, while potentially offering long-term capital appreciation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s explore three dividend aristocrat stocks that stand out for their robust business models and solid fundamentals.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nTopping our list of dividend aristocrat stocks to buy is the global healthcare behemoth Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company currently operates across two segments: Janssen, its pharmaceutical segment, and Johnson & Johnson MedTech, its medical technology segment. But management has recently announced that the former segment will now be rebranded as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine.\n\nThe healthcare titan announced strong financial results for the first quarter in April. Total sales rose 2.3% year-to-date (YTD) to $21.4 billion, while adjusted net earnings climbed 3.8% to $6.58 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged 12.4% to $2.71 per share. Management also raised the midpoint of full-year 2024 adjusted operational sales guidance from 5.5% to 5.8%.\n\nRecently, Johnson & Johnson MedTech announced it is working withNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to enable AI-based model development. As a result, the company is hoping to achieve real-time AI deployment through JNJ MedTech’s digital surgery ecosystem. Research suggests between 2023 and 2032, the AI-based healthcare segment should grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 29%.\n\nDespite losing around 4% YTD, JNJ shares seem reasonably priced at 14.2x forward earnings. In addition, the stock offers a compelling 3.28% dividend yield. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $170 for JNJ, suggesting potential upside of close to 14% from current levels.\n\nAir Products and Chemicals (APD) Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PA\n\nSource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial gas manufacturer Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is another top pick as a dividend aristocrat stock. APD develops and operates some of the world’s largest industrial gas projects. Their core business focuses on supplying atmospheric industrial gases to various industries. Those includ oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen and carbon dioxide,\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late April, Air Products and Chemicals delivered mixed second quarter 2024 earnings. Revenue totaled $2.93 billion, down 8% from the previous year and falling short of estimates of $3.047 billion. On the other hand, adjusted net income rose to $694 million, a 7.6% increase compared to the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EPS came in at $2.85, up 4% from the previous year, and surpassing estimates of $2.69.\n\nRecently, Air Products received funding to build two large-scale hydrogen refueling stations (HRS)in the region of North-Rhine Westphalia in Germany. These stations will have the capability of fueling a range of vehicles including medium and heavy-duty classes. Germany has been installing HRSs as it decarbonizes its vast transportation network. The trend is likely to continue in the country as well as the rest of the European Union (EU).\n\nMeanwhile, the APD board increased the quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share in January. At present, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.96%. Since the start of the year, APD has tumbled more than 10%, making the stock even more attractive for income-focused investors. Currently, the shares trade at 19.3x forward earnings. Wall Street still remains bullish, with a median 12-month price target of $263, implying a potential 8% upside.\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB) Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.\n\nSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final dividend aristocrat pick is personal care consumer giantKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB). Some of its brands readers will recognize include Huggies, Pull-Ups, Poise, Kleenex, Scott and Cottonelle.\n\nRecently, Kimberly-Clark announced first quarter earning results. Sales dipped 1% YOY to $5.1 billion, impacted mainly by foreign currency translation and divestitures in Brazil in June 2023. But adjusted net income jumped by 14% YOY to $658 million fueled by gross profit gains. Meanwhile, diluted EPS also increased 14% to $1.91 despite a negative impact from the company’s transformation initiative.\n\nIn mid-March, the company outlined the next phase of its strategic plan. Management is looking to revamp the operating model and key commercial initiatives with the aim of accelerating brand and business growth. As a result, investors will need to evaluate the steps being taken by Kimberly-Clark’s management.\n\nMeanwhile, the board raised its quarterly payout to $1.22 per share in January. The shares currently have a dividend yield of 3.58%. Despite the volatility on Wall Street, KMB stock has gained a solid 13% YTD and now trades at 19.2x forward earnings. As the Street placed a median 12-month price target of $136, interested readers may consider waiting for a pullback before buying KMB shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil held both long and short positions in NVDA stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "The recent market correction paves the way for exploring compelling opportunities for investors looking for AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe stock market has slipped into correction territory, with key indexes shedding significant value. This slump follows record highs for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks last year, which were driven by a small group of powerful businesses from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAs we chart new waters, the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates would remain high for longer due to ongoing inflation in the world’s largest economy. This approach has no immediate plans for a decrease, which adds to investors’ uncertainty.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, investors now want more than just inflated growth metrics. They demand tangible results that benefit both the top and bottom lines. However, we are still in the early stages, so now is an excellent opportunity to stock up on these three AI stocks.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a digital behemoth that revolutionized social media and owns platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. Additionally, it is a pioneer in the AI revolution, constantly developing to incorporate cutting-edge AI technologies that boost user engagement.\n\nMoreover, Meta is taking things to the next level by building on OpenAI’s ChatGPT initiative. New products like Llama 3 and the addition of real-time image generators to WhatsApp demonstrate this commitment to generative AI. With these developments, Meta is all set to take on its competitors head-to-head and become a significant force in the AI realm.\n\nFurthermore, Meta started off the year with a banger in the first quarter. Its revenue bumped around 27% year-over-year (YOY) to a mind-boggling $36.46 billion, beating estimates by $240 million. Likewise, its earnings-per-share (EPS) clocked in at $4.71, slashing analyst expectations by 39 cents. Despite these fantastic results, we witnessed a dip in the company’s shares after it provided a cautious outlook. Nevertheless, this presents a lucrative chance to buy the stock and maximize long-term profits.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ: SOUN) is at the forefront of interactive AI, a sector expected to grow rapidly. The company uses AI to provide contemporary text-to-speech and speech recognition capabilities, enabling real-time translation and applications. This expertise broadens its customer base to restaurants, automobiles, and support centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) announcement on the ownership position in SOUN catapulted the stock to the top charts. However, NVDA’s plan to sell up to 150 million shares was not well received and resulted in over 10% drop in SOUN’s stock price last month. Yet, TipRanks analysts are optimistic and see a stellar 59% upside potential.\n\nThis upside potential is stoked by the SOUN’s bright future growth prospects. The company has projected revenue for the fiscal year 2024 between $63 million and $77 million, which is greater than the $69.73 million average analyst estimate.\n\nLastly, with a 112% price upswing this year and trading approximately 50% below its peak of $10.25, a considerable horizon lies ahead for this small stock.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: UiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) specializes in robotics process automation (RPA), a niche that harnesses software robots and AI to streamline routine tasks. As businesses increasingly emphasize cutting costs and increasing productivity, robust automation solutions will become essential. Since PATH is regarded as the best RPA tool available, these developments will benefit it greatly.\n\nBuilding on this trend, UiPath has included Watsonx.ai capabilities into its platform in partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM), giving users access to core AI models. The claim is that more than 1,500 businesses use UiPath Autopilot, resulting in consistent weekly production and expression.\n\nThis technological leap has propelled UiPath’s impressive financial growth. In Q4, the company notched a revenue of $405.25 million, up 31.4% YOY and surpassing estimates by $21.56 million.\n\nLooking ahead, UiPath anticipates generating $330 million to $335 million in revenue for Q1 of the 2025 fiscal year instead of the analysts’ projected $338 million. If we add the 40% upside potential assigned by TipRanks analysts, UiPath shines as a prime choice among AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNabeel Bukhari is a seasoned research analyst and keen investor.

Its investments in generative AI and machine learning to enhance its product portfolio are expected to have improved its performance as well.\n\nUPST’s expertise in offering unsecured loans, particularly when traditional banks refrain from lending during a macroeconomic crisis, along with its ongoing efforts to automate the unsecured loan process, are expected to have contributed positively in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nDuring first-quarter 2024, the company introduced Recognized Customer Personalization, a new feature of the Upstart Referral Network. It allows banks and credit unions to offer personalized loan options to their existing customers seeking loans. This enhancement is expected to have boosted UPST's performance.\n\nUpstart Holdings is expected to have gained from multiple partnerships with banks and credit unions, including PriorityONE, Kaua'i Federal, Liberty Savings and Maine Savings.\n\nHowever, challenges from the softening lending market due to heightened consumer risk caused by numerous bank failures and dislocation of capital markets may have affected the top line. The degradation in the macro environment caused by worldwide geopolitical tension is expected to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the deterioration of the macroeconomic landscape, coupled with the growing conservatism among lenders, is likely to have resulted in heightened loan pricing within the company's platform and decreased approval rates for loan applicants. Consequently, this is expected to have diminished transaction volume and affected the company's revenue stream.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Upstart Holdings this season.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 10 Stocks to Buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 5 Stocks.\n\nCramer Thanks Powell for \"All-Clear\" Sign\n\nJim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an \"all-clear\" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs.\n\nJerome Powell: \"The Bull's Best Friend\"\n\nHe thinks Jerome Powell has become \"the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend.\" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of \"softness all over the place,\" Powell is currently \"more of a dove than a hawk\" since he believes inflation will \"go away on its own.\"\n\nPowell Takes Another Rate-Hike Scenario Off the Table\n\nCramer said Jerome Powell was \"badgered\" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is \"too smart\" as he didn’t take the \"bait\" and took the \"dreaded\" rate hike scenario \"off the table.\"\n\n\" I think Jay Powell has realized that these brown shoots are doing the work for him and his consistent messaging in the face of endless Fedspeak tells me that I think you should hand on to stocks.\"\n\nCramer Laments About The Market's Obsession with Fed\n\nJim Cramer in another program last week again voiced his frustrations about the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve's comment, saying jobs numbers, inflation, possibility of rate cuts and the Fed's future moves is \"all we talk about.\" Cramer said that some analysts were expecting the Fed chief Jerome Powell to \"lower the boom\" of the stock market by \"saying something hawkish.\" Cramer is surprised that some circles in the market are talking about another raise.\n\n\"We are one again hostage to everyone's worries about the Fed which is another way of saying, everyone's worries about inflation.\"\n\nJim Cramer on What Should You Buy in the Current Environment\n\nAfter analyzing the current market situation, Cramer came straight to what matters the most for an average investor:\n\n\"So, what wins in this environment? What do you do? Well, pretty much everything is going to kind of work here,\" Cramer said before analyzing different stocks some of which we will discuss in this article.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't Miss: Jim Cramer's Stock Picks Heading into May 2024 Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors in the current market environment. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nJim Cramer is anxiously waiting for the latest quarter report from Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) as his charitable trust owns a position in the company. In a latest program, Cramer highlighted that Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) has two casinos in Macau. Cramer is bullish on the China business of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) because he thinks the Chinese are \"willing to travel locally.\"\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is scheduled to post earnings May 7 after markets close.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), an owner and operator of hotels and casino resorts, declined modestly in the most recent quarter, in part due to concerns about economic weakness in China.\n\nWe remain optimistic about the multi-year prospects for the company. We believe the ongoing re-emergence of business activity in Macau will drive additional shareholder value. If cash flow returns to the level achieved in 2019 prior to COVID-19, we believe Wynn’s shares will increase 30% to 50% higher than where they have recently traded.\n\nWe believe additional drivers for future value creation beyond a re-emergence in Macau business activity include: (i) our expectation for long-term growth opportunities in the company’s U.S.-centric markets of Las Vegas and Boston, including an expansion of Wynn’s Encore Boston Harbor resort; (ii) Wynn’s plans to develop an integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates with 1,500 hotel rooms and a casino that is similar in size to that of Encore Boston Harbor; (iii) opportunities to improve cash-flow margins by rightsizing labor and achieving lower staff costs in Macau; (iv) the possibility that Wynn is granted a New York casino license; and (v) an expansion in the company’s valuation multiple to levels achieved prior to the pandemic.”\n\n9. Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 47\n\nA caller reminded Jim Cramer during his program that he was bullish on Cloud software company Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA) last month. The stock is down about 3.3% over the past 30 days. The questioner asked whether Cramer is still bullish on the company.\n\n\"Oh am I ever, I think Okta is terrific.\"\n\nCramer also praised Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon and said that he was \"humbled\" by the hacking attack and \"learned\" from it. Cramer was referring to the attack on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in which hackers, according to the company, stole data of almost all users of its customer support system.\n\nMeridian Growth Fund made the following comment about Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the largest independent identity software company, serving enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits, and government agencies across the globe. Its solutions provide higher-level security authentication services, a business-critical function that has the attention of CEOs and IT leaders everywhere. The company’s integration with 7,000 other software vendors and system providers is a competitive advantage that enables rapid and seamless implementations. Okta’s complete product suite allows customers to deploy an enterprise-wide identity platform that serves both the workforce segment (clients’ employees) and the customer segments (clients’ customers). The stock has started to recover after falling nearly 85% from post-COVID bubble levels due to a stabilization in the overall macro environment for security services. The company has also seen a normalization in salesforce attrition which had hampered growth. The stock moved higher during the quarter when it reported higher than expected revenues and a much-improved adjusted operating margin of 11% versus -3% in the prior year quarter. Beyond its core capabilities, which are in high demand, we are also encouraged by the company’s ability to expand into product adjacencies such as privileged access management and identity governance. Due to these improving fundamentals, we added to our position in the company during the period.”\n\n8. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nJim Cramer earlier this month hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), saying the stock is \"cheap.\" Cramer said Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) CEO Michael Dell is \"terrific.\" Cramer said Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) is a \"good stock to own\" and he wants people to buy it. In addition to DELL, he's also recommending Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 56 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL). The most notable stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) is owned by Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $383 million stake in Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL).\n\n7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). He said he \"likes Costco very much.\" Last month Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) upped its dividend by 13.7%. Jim Cramer praised this news and said the hike shows the stock has the potential to go higher.\n\n6. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 72\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA), saying HCA Healthcare Inc's (NYSE:HCA) latest quarter was \"good.\"\n\n\"I'm going to have to go with it. I know it's been uneven last year but it's been a great long-term horse.\"\n\nHCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) recently posted first quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $5.93. Revenue in the quarter jumped 11.2% year over year to $17.34 billion.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 72 hedge funds reported owning stakes in HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA).\n\nIn addition to HCA, investors are also watching Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We eliminated one position, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), during the quarter as the stock traded at our estimate of fair value. HCA was a very good investment and more than quadrupled from our original investment price in 2016. We believe HCA is a well-managed business with the best collection of assets in the hospital space. Hospital stocks tend to be much more volatile than their actual intrinsic value, and we would gladly purchase HCA again if the discount to value warrants.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Recommends 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Intel Claims It's On Track To Catch Up By 2026 Despite A Lackluster Outlook\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) fell short of revenue estimates, but topped earnings per share estimates with its first quarter financials. But, Intel remains confident of its ongoing revival and claims it is on track to catch up to its peers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) and even the mightly AI chip leader Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the March quarter, Intel reported revenue rose 9% YoY to $12.7 billion, slightly below $12.78 billion that LSEG expected. Intel narrowed its net loss from last year’s comparable quarter when it lost $2.8 billion, or 66 cents per share to $400 million, or 9 cents per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to 18 cents, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 14 cents.\n\nThis was Intel’s first report since revealing it had established its chip manufacturing business, Intel Foundry, a separate line item with its own costs and sales. Intel Foundry posted a revenue of $4.4 billion, which Intel noted was a 10% YoY drop, while operating loss amounted to $2.5 billion.\n\nClient Computing sales, Intel’s biggest business which is making chips for PCs and laptops, reported revenue rose 31% YoY to $7.5 billion.\n\nData Center and AI business, which include making central processors for servers, reported revenue rose 5% YoY to $3 billion, while Intel continues to fight for market share against the industry leader, Nvidia.\n\nIntel is working hard to stay relevant in a highly competitive environment.\n\nIntel is investing heavily in AI. Earlier in April, it revealed it will be releasing a new AI processor for servers. Named Gaudi 3, this will be Intel’s attempt to go after Nvidia. Intel plans to challenge Nvidia or more precisely, its popular graphic processing units. With Gaudi 3, Intel promised a 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency compared to Nvidia-made GPUs. Intel expects its newest offering to bring in more than $500 million in sales during the second half of the year.\n\nIntel claims it's on track to close the gap despite providing a lackluster second quarter guidance.\n\nFor the current quarter, Intel guided for earnings of 10 cents per share which was significantly below 25 cents per share that analysts on average expected, while revenue of $13 billion at midpoint was below sales of $13.57 billion that analysts expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, CEO Pat Gelsinger confirmed that Intel remains on track to close the technology gap that is the result of more than a decade of underinvestment and catch up by 2026.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Unity Software U is set to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 9.\r\n\r\nThe company expects first-quarter revenues between $415 million and $420 million, indicating a decline of 15-16% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $422.53 million, indicating a decrease of 15.55% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 5 cents per share, which has remained unchanged in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nUnity Software’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 69.43%.\n\nUnity Software Inc.

Quote\n\nFactors Likely to Influence Q1 Results\n\nUnity Software is restructuring its portfolio to focus on core businesses only. This restructuring is expected to aid the long-term growth of the company. The decline of business operation verticals is likely to have affected top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, the company entered into some notable partnerships to better support game developers, as well as in-cabin car experience.\r\n\r\nThe company is also right sizing the cost structure to grow from a healthy financial position. This includes the previously announced reduction of approximately 25% of the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis includes a partnership with Valeo Racer, a new extended reality in-car gaming experience for passengers developed using Unity Software. The game integrates the vehicle's real surroundings, including buildings, roads and traffic, offering unique experiences and challenges every time. U has also announced a groundbreaking partnership with Mazda to pioneer a next-generation in-cabin car experience, promising a seamless journey for drivers.\r\n\r\nThe company has been expanding its platform by introducing relevant capabilities. This is likely to have been a major growth driver in customer engagement.\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

Price and EPS Surprise Magnite, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMagnite, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Magnite, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nMagnite’s first-quarter performance is expected to have suffered from increasing competition and seasonality in the business.\r\n\r\nDeclining momentum across all formats and device types, including connected Television (CTV), DV+, mobile, non-CTV video and display, is likely to have affected MGNI’s performance.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Magnite partnered with Mediaocean to bring deeper automation and greater supply path efficiency to the latter's Prisma buyers for CTV and online video. This is expected to have aided the company’s top-line growth.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, MGNI’s CTV revenues, excluding TAC, declined 2% year over year to $63.5 million. The company expects revenues between $49 million and $51 million in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nCTV revenues suffered in the previous quarter, mainly due to mix shifts and managed service softness trends in the streaming market. This trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nContributions from a robust partner base, including the likes of Sling, Hulu, Pluto, Tubi, Discovery and Fox and device manufacturing companies like Roku and Samsung, are expected to have contributed to MGNI’s revenues in the quarter under review.\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nMagnite has an Earnings ESP of -166.67% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

        "content": "Airbnb ABNB is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 8.\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $2.03 billion and $2.07 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 12-14% on a reported basis.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.07 billion, indicating growth of 13.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported value.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 26 cents per share, suggesting growth of 44.4% from the year-ago reported figure.

Price and EPS Surprise Airbnb, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nAirbnb, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Airbnb, Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nAirbnb’s first-quarter 2024 results are expected to reflect growing Nights and Experiences booked across all geographies, owing to growing momentum among first-time bookers.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Nights and Experiences Booked is pegged at 132.1 million, indicating growth of 9.1% from the year-ago reported figure.\r\n\r\nGrowing gross nights booked, owing to the solid momentum in Airbnb app downloads is likely to have boosted the top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across cross-border travel is likely to have acted as a tailwind for the company.\r\n\r\nAll these factors are expected to have driven growth in gross booking value (GBV) in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GBV is pegged at $22.5 billion, indicating growth of 10.3% from the reported figure in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company’s increasing focus on developing innovative and personalized AI interfaces is likely to have been another positive.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in active listings, owing to increasing supply across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America, is likely to have aided the company’s top line during the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nABNB’s growing awareness around hosting and new features introduced for hosts are likely to have acted as tailwinds for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have remained an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nAlso, greater volatility in travel demand due to macroeconomic uncertainties and the impacts of geopolitical conflicts may have been a major concern.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Airbnb this time around.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Results from the world’s biggest technology companies have brought mostly good news. There’s just one missing piece: Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTruce Talks Drag as Hamas Hits Israel Crossing in Deadly Attack Buffett Praises Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake Treasury Rally Risks Running Into a $125 Billion Brick Wall France’s Macron Calls for Reset of Economic Ties With China Lamborghini Bros No More: Crypto Is Creating a New Wealth Effect\n\nThe company, whose dominance in chips that do the heavy lifting for AI computing have made it the focal point in a market captivated by the burgeoning technology, isn’t due to report earnings until May 22.\n\nThat’s well after other releases that have shown profits rising at a healthy clip, demand for artificial intelligence tools boosting sales for cloud computing services and signs of continued heavy spending on AI gear.\n\n“You have massive buyers of chips coming in saying we were already buying a ton, we’re buying even more. The question for Nvidia is: is it enough?,” Mike Bailey, director of research at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman LLC, said on Friday.\n\nNvidia shares rose as much as 1.4% at the open of Monday trading.\n\nAmong Nvidia’s biggest customers, Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have all indicated that capital expenditures will continue at the current pace or increase this year.\n\nNvidia shares have rebounded since April 19, when AI hardware makers tumbled ahead of the first week of Big Tech earnings. The stock is up 18% since then but it’s still down about 5% from a March peak. With other AI hardware maker shares falling in the wake of strong earnings reports, it’s clear that expectations are high.\n\nRival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. tumbled nearly 9% on May 1 despite raising its forecast for AI accelerator sales this year to $4 billion from $3.5 billion. Super Micro Computer Inc., the server maker whose shares have gained more than 170% this year, dropped 14% after its earnings report that included forecasts for revenue and profits that far exceeded the average of analyst estimates.\n\nWith earnings from about 80% of the S&P 500 already in, technology and communication services companies are beating profit estimates at a stellar clip. Roughly 90% of tech and communication services companies have topped earnings estimates, well ahead of the 79% average for the benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRead More: Nvidia Shares Go on a $290 Billion Tear as Clients Splurge on AI\n\nThe trouble is that the results have had difficulty moving the needle for stocks after a rally that’s lifted the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index by more than 35% over the past 12 months. Both groups rank at the bottom of the main S&P 500 sectors for stock price moves the day after earnings. The average move for the tech sector is down around 1.5% while communications shares have fallen 2.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo UBS’s Solita Marcelli, AI computing stocks remain attractive with combined capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon expected to exceed $200 billion this year, up $20 billion from a previous estimate.\n\n“We are encouraged by many positives in tech fundamentals during the first-quarter reporting season, which in our view continue to support the investment case for generative artificial intelligence,” said Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Financial Services.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nAt Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday, Warren Buffett heaped praise on Apple Inc. — after revealing he’d cut his stake in it. Jack Dorsey has left the board of social networking service Bluesky, which he helped fund and popularize a year ago in the wake of regret over the sale of Twitter to Elon Musk. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.’s shares jumped to a record high after posting its strongest monthly sales growth since the start of 2023, potentially raising expectations for iPhone and AI server sales. The $26 billion offer from Apollo Global Management Inc. and Sony Group Corp. this week threw a wrench in talks between Paramount Global and film producer David Ellison. X, the social network owned by Elon Musk, will start summarizing news events inside the app by using xAI’s chatbot, Grok. Chinese self-driving firm Beijing Momenta Technology Co. has filed confidentially for an initial public offering in the US, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEarnings Due Monday\n\nPremarket\n\nModel N Postmarket\n\nPalantir Lucid Microchip Coherent Corp Fabrinet Varonis Systems Teradata Lumentum Zeta Ultra Clean SEMrush Matterport Adeia Inc Adtran Holdings\n\n(Updates stock move at market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation The State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring AI Is Helping Automate One of the World’s Most Gruesome Jobs Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

A lot depends on the path the Federal Reserve takes on interest rates. While multiple rate cuts are no longer in the cards, any glimmer of hope could send stocks soaring. Inflation continuing to rise, on the other hand, would be a sure-fire damper.

That’s because the old General Electric split itself into two separately traded companies. One was the aerospace division, which retained the legacy ticker, and the renewable energy business was renamed GE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) and got a new ticker symbol (GEV). The old GE that people knew is no more.\n\nHowever, as investors prepared for a different kind of halving event, GE stock soared. Shares are up 59.8% in 2024, good enough for a third-place showing.\n\nGE Aerospace had $32 billion in revenue last year with 70% generated by services. It starts its new life as an independent company with an installed base of 44,000 commercial engines and 26,000 military and defense engines globally. GE Aerospace believes it can achieve $10 billion in operating profit by 2028.\n\nGeneral Electric was founded in 1892 as the merger between Thomas Edison’s Edison General Electric and two other electric companies. It eventually grew into a major industrial conglomerate. But over the years it divested many of its businesses and today has a different purpose and trajectory ahead of it.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot surprising to many, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be a massive growth story. Shares are up 69.5% this year, continuing to pad the lead it posted in 2023. The chipmaker is powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and though it is down from the all-time highs hit last month, the market still expects Nvidia stock to grow further this year.\n\nFourth quarter revenue was $22.1 billion, a 265% from the year-ago figure and well ahead of management’s forecast of $20 billion. That was due to companies building next-gen data centers, or what Nvidia calls “AI factories.” It now expects Q1 revenue to be $24 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there is a good chance investors will experience a lot more volatility with the stock. Rockets like the chipmaker will run into instances when it just can’t keep up with demand and those shortfalls will wreak havoc around earnings time. The business remains solid but because expectations of peak performance are built into the stock price, anything even slightly underwhelming will send shares lower.\n\nNvidia is priced for perfection. At 69 times trailing earnings and 34 times sales, NVDA stock is not cheap. That doesn’t mean it is a bad company, but you may wish to find other opportunities that offer better valuations or smoother forward progress.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to see an overreaction, look at what’s happening to Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). While it is still the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 with shares soaring 149% in 2024, that was after a 17% pullback in the stock after “missing” earnings.\n\nMind you, Super Micro’s revenues tripled in its fiscal third quarter while profits quadrupled from last year. But because Wall Street was looking for even greater sales, the stock plummeted on the news.\n\nThat is the type of situation investors should pounce on. It is obvious the maker of AI-optimized servers, storage and equipment for data centers is on fire with more demand for its product than it knows what to do with. That is blistering growth that should not have been punished.\n\nThere is no let up in demand for data centers. Not even if the economy were to fall into a recession would the demand ebb. Hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are undergoing a demand wave themselves and are building out their own data center footprint. Because Super Micro’s equipment is essential to their proper working, look for its stock to quickly regain the lost ground and advance once again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Play Likely Earnings Beat With These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks",
        "content": "It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are of high quality.\n\nIn this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Amazon.com AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS, Alaska Air Group ALK and DocuSign DOCU as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks That Can Beat?\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.\n\nLast EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.\n\nIn addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.\n\nEarnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.\n\nIn order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:\n\nNext 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.\n\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.\n\nA handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only nine.\n\nHere are five out of nine stocks:\n\nAmazon.com: The Zacks Rank #2 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon's online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by its massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. The average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 48.17%.\n\nNVIDIA: The Zacks Rank #2 company is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.\n\nOver the years, NVIDIA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. The average earnings surprise of NVDA for the past four quarters is 20.18%.\n\nZscaler: The company is one of the world’s leading providers of cloud-based security solutions. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nZscaler offers a full range of enterprise network security services, including web security, Internet security, antivirus, vulnerability management, firewalls, and control over user activity in mobile, cloud computing, and Internet of things environments. The average earnings surprise of ZS for the past four quarters is 28.17%.\n\nAlaska Air Group: The Zacks Rank #2 airline company, together with its partner regional carriers, serves more than 120 cities across North America. Alaska Air Group also offers passenger and cargo services to/within Alaska.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of ALK for the past four quarters is 22.68%.\n\nDocuSign: The Zacks Rank #2 company is a global provider of cloud-based software. DocuSign’s anchor product eSignature helps businesses prepare, sign, act on and manage agreements digitally. Contract Lifecycle Management automates workflows across the agreement process. Insight scouts and analyzes agreements by legal concepts and clauses using artificial intelligence, and Analyzer analyzes inbound agreements by detecting clauses by type, scoring their risk and extracting important terms.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of DOCU for the past four quarters is 23.72%.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "Instead of Buying Nvidia Stock, I'm Buying This AI ETF Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Climbing 467% over the past three years, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has skyrocketed as investors have raced to gain artificial intelligence (AI) exposure. Those looking to add AI exposure to their portfolios may feel they've missed the boat on Nvidia stock. Plus, they may feel overwhelmed by the variety of other choices to consider.\n\nBut the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: CHAT) has all those bases covered. In addition to holding a large position in Nvidia, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF provides exposure to a variety of other AI-focused companies that stand to benefit from growth in generative AI, machine learning, and large language models.\n\nThis is going to be big\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that people had little exposure to generative AI. Nowadays, it feels unavoidable. \r\nAnd it's nearly a certainty that its presence in our lives is going to continue ramping higher. In fact, many pundits predict that it's going to accelerate considerably. Business intelligence firm Markets and Markets projects the generative AI market will represent about $21 billion in 2024 and soar at a 37% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 when it will reach $137 billion.\n\nEager to benefit from the growth in generative AI, investors have unsurprisingly raced to Nvidia stock. A leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia helps data centers handle the tremendous computing demands that generative AI platforms place on them. With its recent rise, however, Nvidia stock is now trading at 69 times operating cash flow (OCF), making it unappealing for those looking to avoid high valuations.\n\nAn AI ETF like no other\n\nBranding the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF as the \"world's first Generative AI ETF,\" Roundhill Investments, the manager of the fund, cites research from GoldmanSachs that estimates AI can contribute to $7 trillion in economic growth worldwide over the next 10 years.\n\nWith 46 holdings in the fund, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF offers investors wide exposure to leading companies that will drive the advancement of generative AI. Of course, Nvidia holds a prominent position in the ETF with a 10.1% weighting, making it the largest position, so those wary of Nvidia stock on its own will still have some exposure. Rounding out the top-three positions, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are the second- and third-largest positions, respectively.\n\nWhereas Nvidia makes the GPUs that help support generative AI computing, Microsoft is developing AI solutions such as Copilot, an AI assistant that integrates with several Microsoft products. The company's reach in AI extends further with its multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT. Similarly, Google is incorporating AI into offerings such as Gemini, a generative AI chatbot. And in exploring the potential for AI in various applications, Google operates the DeepMind Lab where its exploring the development of artificial general intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META), whose Llama 3 large language model can be used to develop generative AI applications, is the fifth-largest position in the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, it's not only Magnificent Seven stocks that hold top spots; Adobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is the fourth-largest position. A generative AI application, Adobe's Firefly can be used across various Adobe products, such as Express, Photoshop, and Illustrator.\n\nIs the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology right for you?\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia stock is extremely alluring right now considering the company's position as a stalwart GPU developer, but it's hardly the only generative AI game in town. Investors cognizant of this fact -- and who are looking for comprehensive exposure to the industry -- therefore will want to pay particular attention to the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF, which provides a singular opportunity to gain broad exposure to generative AI. I know I am. This exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been on my watchlist for several months now, and I plan on starting a position in the coming weeks to sit in the niche of my portfolio carved out for growth investments.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 6, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\n\nMag 7 Leadership Reflects Earnings Power\n\nWith Q1 results from Apple and Amazon now out, we only have Nvidia’s results still awaited at this stage of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of companies. The sub-par growth numbers from Tesla and Apple notwithstanding, the Mag 7 group as a whole showed impressive top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\n\nIn fact, had it not been for the substantial earnings contribution from the Mag 7, Q1 earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.\n\nIt is interesting to note here that the market reaction to the Tesla and Apple releases has thus far been the best of the group. This may look odd since Tesla’s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple’s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn’t surprising as both companies’ results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple’s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.\n\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2024 Q1, the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 22.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\n\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +28.2% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 1200 companies reporting results, including 54 S&P 500 members. This week’s notable reports include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Shopify, and others.\n\nThrough Friday, May 3rd, we have seen Q1 results from 400 S&P 500 index members, or 80% of the index’s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 400 index members are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -2.2%, while the growth pace improves to +8.3% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.7% revenue growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> A Positive Earnings Picture Remains\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "I was wrong about SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock. After three years of waiting for a return on my investment, I sold my shares recently, at a loss.\n\nThe stock currently sells at about $7/share. If you got in a year ago, when it traded near $5, you’re in great shape. But I’d still recommend you sell it.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Stock and Consumer Banking\n\nSoFi has evolved into a consumer bank. Its main business is taking deposits and making loans, for houses, for education, and for other life expenses.\n\nThis can be a good business. It’s certainly growing for SoFi. SoFi revenues last year passed $2.1 billion. They were $1.57 billion in 2022, and under $1 billion the year before that.\n\nThe problem is that SoFi continues to lose money, because SoFi wants to be much more than a consumer bank.\n\nAs I wrote last November, it offers banking software through Technisys, banking services through Galileo, and automates risk management through Konecta.\n\nIt competes with Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) in brokerage. CEO Anthony Noto talks of it becoming a “10-bagger,” delivering 10-for-1 returns to investors.\n\nI bought this hook, line, and sinker. I defended the company after bad earnings last year, when it fell from $10/share to $8.\n\nBut it’s still just a bank. Banks are defined by their “yield spread,” the difference between what they pay for money and what they rent it for.\n\nBut SoFi’s spread is narrower than the big banks it competes with. That’s because it’s paying depositors 4.5% for their money, with no account fees.\n\nBanking Breaking Bad\n\nI wasn’t just wrong on SoFi. I was wrong about the whole banking sector.\n\nI figured that once money started costing money, as it does now, selling money should be a great business. But banks are leveraged. They compete with private equity companies that aren’t.\n\nBanks face regulation private lenders don’t. They also hold reserves against deposits, whose return could be lower than what’s needed to run the business. Watch those maturities!\n\nAgainst this backdrop, SoFi is also taking low-quality credits. I love millennials and have two of my own. But lending to low net-worth borrowers carries risk. SoFi reported 4.8% of its loans were in default at the end of March.\n\nSoFi keeps seeking new niches that might offer a greater return. Buying Wyndham Capital last year got it into home loans, but it hasn’t expanded that niche. Its growth in the March quarter was still in personal loans.\n\nThat’s why professional money managers have soured on SoFi. Tipranks now has just as many buyers as sellers, 4, with eight on the fence.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders at Stocktwits remain bullish, copying Noto’s statements like he’s Warren Buffett of Berkshire-Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). He’s not.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t make money in SoFi stock right now. The stock might even go up from here. The question is how much you might make and whether that is worth your time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWatching TV analyst Jim Cramer’s contortions over the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) quarter, I was reminded of an old investment aphorism. Not all good companies are good investments.\n\nSoFi is a good company. Noto is a good operator. In the present economic cycle, it’s just not a great investment.\n\nThere’s always an opportunity cost in what you own. I decided my money could be doing something else. I could own Amazon. Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIf you insist on owning banks, buy JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). If you really need diversification, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) isn’t a bad bet.\n\nBut you learn to pull the plug on what doesn’t work. Selling is the hardest lesson investors learn. Not everything works. SoFi didn’t.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN, NVDA, and PEP.

        "title": "3 Best-Performing Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "While you might not agree with the political stuff, Nancy Pelosi stocks have represented a tremendously popular topic. You might say there’s bipartisan support for tracking the securities that the former House Speaker has acquired.\n\nInvestors have plenty of reasons to consider trading alongside the legislator. First, Pelosi is smart. Again, you can disagree with her politics. However, you don’t rise to power (and stay there) without commanding tremendous intellect. Second, she knows how things work (or don’t work). If Pelosi feels strongly about a company, you should at least pay attention.\n\nGranted, no one has a 100% success rate. Still, these Nancy Pelosi stocks have proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the more recent acquisitions among Nancy Pelosi stocks, the former House Speaker acquired shares of cybersecurity specialist Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) in February of this year. Technically speaking, it’s not the outright best-performing idea this year. Since the beginning of January, PANW has moved up a bit over 2%. However, the potential is robust.\n\nPer information provided by Forbes, a data breach costs on average about $4.45 million. It notes that in 2022, business email accounts that suffered data compromises incurred $2.7 billion in losses. It’s no surprise, then, that the global cybersecurity industry should reach a valuation of $208.8 billion by the end of the year.\n\nAs for Palo Alto Networks, experts project that it will post $7.98 billion in revenue by year’s end. If so, that would be up 15.8% from last year’s haul of $6.89 billion. In fiscal 2025, sales could rise to $9.13 billion.\n\nPANW isn’t the best-performing idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks. However, it offers significant long-term upside potential.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nA longtime supporter of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pelosi last acquired shares of the technology giant in June of last year. It’s been an amazing investment. Sure, MSFT is only up 7% after suffering a recent correction due to broader tech sector momentum loss. However, in the past 52 weeks, it’s up more than 30%. That’s quite a turnaround from the days when MSFT was just a boring element in the landscape.\n\nMuch of the enthusiasm currently centers on the company’s investments in artificial intelligence. With more companies exploring the capabilities of generative AI, Microsoft positioned itself early. Bloomberg notes that the sector itself could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032. That’s one big reason why MSFT ranks among the top Nancy Pelosi stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts anticipate a strong year in fiscal 2024, forecasting earnings per share to hit $11.79. That’s well above last year’s print of $9.81. On the top line, sales could fly up to $244.93 billion or a 15.6% increase from 2023’s haul of $211.91 billion. Moreover, the most optimistic revenue target calls for a print of $248.47 billion.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly one of the favorite (if not the favorite) ideas among Nancy Pelosi stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been kicking the bears’ hindquarters since the closing months of 2022. The former House Speaker last acquired NVDA in November last year. It’s been a lucrative decision. Over the past six months (going back to Nov. 2), NVDA gained over 97% of its equity value.\n\nThat’s really nothing compared to the past 52-week performance, when NVDA ripped out a 204% return. Nvidia of course is best known for its graphics processing units. Initially, these GPUs focused on gaming applications. Increasingly, though, their processing capabilities served myriad other functions, such as datacenters and of course AI. With more enterprises focused on digital intelligence, Nvidia commands an enviable advantage in the space.\n\nAdmittedly, there is a risk regarding AI being overhyped. If so, a steeper correction could materialize than the one we’ve seen. Still, analysts don’t seem worried one bit. For the current fiscal year, they’re targeting revenue of $111.92 billion, up 83.7% from last year’s tally of $60.92 billion.\n\nMust be grand to live a life of public service.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Nvidia Stock Will Plunge 28%. Is He Right?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a Wall Street darling for quite a while now. And for good reason. The stock has roughly tripled over the past 12 months and is up more than sevenfold since September 2022.\n\nHowever, not everyone on Wall Street remains enthusiastic about Nvidia. One analyst thinks shares of the GPU maker will plunge close to 28% over the next 12 months.\n\nA prediction of trouble ahead\n\nD.A. Davidson's Gil Luria set a price target of $620 for Nvidia. That reflects expectations of a steep decline from the current share price of around $864.\n\nWhy is Luria so bearish about the chip stock? He predicts potential trouble ahead due to a shift in spending by big technology companies. In particular, Luria thinks major Nvidia customers including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft will eventually have all the GPU capacity they need. He told BNN Bloomberg recently that these tech giants won't continue buying chips for generative AI indefinitely at the rate they've been buying.\n\nAll of these companies have developed their own AI chips. For example, Google announced its new Arm-based Axion chip in April. Meta rolled out the next generation of its custom-made MTIA chip last month as well. Amazon offers cloud customers the option of using its cost-effective Inferentia and Trainium2 chips to run AI apps. Microsoft has its Maia and Cobalt AI chips.\n\nSome big Nvidia customers have also turned to Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Meta and Microsoft are buying AMD's new Instinct MI300X chip. AMD claims the chip is better at AI inference than Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU.\n\nOthers warning about Nvidia's risk\n\nLuria is in the minority on Wall Street. Of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG so far in May, 21 rate the stock as either a buy or a strong buy. However, he's not alone in sounding a warning about the risks for Nvidia.\n\nRichard Hunter, Interactive Investor's head of markets, has expressed concern that Nvidia could become a victim of inflated expectations. He also thinks tensions with China could hurt Nvidia's share price.\n\nAswath Damodaran, the NYU finance professor known as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" likes Nvidia's business prospects but not its valuation. His model estimated a fair value for the stock of $436 -- close to half the current share price.\n\nDamodaran posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he planned to sell half of his position in Nvidia. He said the stock \"was a bridge too far for me\" because of its premium price.\n\nWill Nvidia stock plunge?\n\nCould these negative predictions about Nvidia come true? Will the stock plunge 28% over the next 12 months? Maybe.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is subject to the laws of supply and demand like any other business is. If the demand for AI chips slows as Luria expects, Nvidia stock will likely pull back. Luria told BNN Bloomberg, \"The higher we go this year, the more we're going to fall next year, and that's not in the stock.\" While he acknowledged that it could take longer than he predicted, Nvidia's current momentum won't last indefinitely.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has a strong first-mover advantage in the AI chip market. So far, demand remains strong. I wouldn't place a bet that Nvidia's shares will indeed fall 28% anytime soon. If it does happen, though, I think it will be a fantastic buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Stock-Split Stocks Instead",
        "content": "At the moment, there's seemingly no hotter trend than artificial intelligence (AI). Utilizing software and systems in place of humans, and allowing these systems to evolve over time without human intervention in order to become more proficient at their tasks, gives AI a broad use-case that covers almost every sector and industry.\n\nBut what's arguably been an even more-trusted group of stocks for Wall Street and investors is companies enacting stock splits.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. I say \"cosmetically,\" because stock splits don't alter a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMost investors tend to focus on forward-stock splits, which are designed to reduce the nominal share price of a publicly traded company to make it more affordable for those without access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Since the midpoint of 2021, nearly a dozen high-profile businesses have conducted a forward-stock split, including AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nHowever, Wall Street's brightest minds aren't necessarily enamored with the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the artificial intelligence revolution. During the December-ended quarter, billionaires were active sellers of Nvidia stock and piled into two recent stock-split stocks instead.\n\nBillionaire investors sent artificial intelligence stock Nvidia to the chopping block\n\nShares of Nvidia have catapulted higher by nearly 470% since the start of 2023. The clear-cut catalyst behind its outperformance is its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), which are what power AI-accelerated data centers. In particular, Nvidia's H100 GPU is responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nWith its chips in high demand, Nvidia has enjoyed jaw-dropping GPU pricing power. Data Center segment sales jumped by 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28), while cost of revenue across all of its segments rose by a far more modest 43%.\n\nDespite these advantages, eight billionaire investors reduced their respective fund's stakes in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe scarcity of Nvidia's GPUs is the primary reason its Data Center sales more than tripled last year. With the company increasing its production of H100 GPUs, and new companies entering the playing field, GPU scarcity is going to be less of a talking point by the latter-half of this year. Billionaires sending Nvidia to the chopping block may be rightly anticipating a drop-off in the company's pricing power and gross margin.\n\nIn addition to an increase in external competition, Nvidia could face immense challenges from internal competitors. Four \"Magnificent Seven\" components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's net sales. Unfortunately, all four of these industry leaders are developing in-house GPUs of their own. There's a real possibility Nvidia's orders from its top customers taper off significantly in the coming years.\n\nHistory might be the other big catalyst that created a billionaire exodus from Nvidia in the December-ended quarter. There hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation in three decades that didn't endure an early stage bubble. Investors commonly overestimate the adoption and uptake of new technology, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to break that trend.\n\nBut while these eight billionaires were busy dumping shares of Nvidia, quite a few were piling into two outperforming stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe first stock-split that was a favorite among billionaire investors during the fourth quarter is retail juggernaut Walmart(NYSE: WMT). Walmart effected a 3-for-1 forward split in late February.\n\nAll told, five of the prominent billionaires who sold Nvidia stock were buyers of Walmart shares, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,416,174 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (540,004 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (261,294 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (150,570 shares)\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, the lure of putting your money to work in Walmart has long been its size. It's a company with deep pockets that's able to purchase products in bulk. A lower per-unit price for most of its goods allows Walmart to undercut traditional grocers and local mom-and-pop shops on price.\n\nTo add to the above, the vastness of the products Walmart carries in its stores is rivaled by only a few competitors. Walmart has evolved into a one-stop shopping experience for consumers looking for a good deal. With the prevailing rate of inflation creeping back up, Walmart is just the type of business we'd expect to benefit.\n\nAnother reason investors tend to put their trust in Walmart stock over the long run is because it's a consumer staples company. It carries basic need goods and services that are going to draw consumers into its stores regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy and stock market are performing. This leads to predictable operating cash flow year after year -- and Wall Street loves predictability.\n\nAlthough Walmart stock isn't cheap, its competitive advantages can yield solid gains for investors over the long run.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe other stock-split stock that billionaires were buying as Nvidia shares were being jettisoned is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle announced plans to enact a 50-for-1 forward split in June, assuming it gains approval from its shareholders.\n\nDuring the December-ended quarter, three notable billionaire investors were buyers of Chipotle stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (32,250 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (15,900 shares)\n\nLike Walmart, Chipotle offers investors a couple of well-defined competitive edges that have led to its long-term outperformance.\n\nFor starters, the company's food has been a differentiator. When possible, the company sources its vegetables locally, and it uses responsibly raised meats that are free of routine-use antibiotics. Chipotle's management team learned a long time ago that consumers will willingly pay more for higher-quality food that doesn't wind up in a freezer.\n\n\"Chipotlanes\" are another big source of growth for the company. A \"Chipotlane' is a dedicated drive-thru lane for mobile orders. Outfitting most of its new stores with these digital drive-thru lanes is helping to expedite orders and sustain a superior growth rate among fast-casual restaurant chains.\n\nPerhaps Chipotle's biggest advantage is the most subtle of them all: its menu. The company has purposely kept its menu relatively small to ensure that its staff can quickly prepare meals and shorten wait times. A limited menu also makes it easier for Chipotle to create meaningful buzz when introducing new items.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Top Index Funds That Beat the S&amp;P 500 Over the Past Decade",
        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest growth stocks on the market, with shares more than tripling in the past year alone. But the hedge fund billionaires listed below sold down their positions in Nvidia during the fourth-quarter and reallocated some capital to two high-growth index funds, the Invesco QQQ Trust(NASDAQ: QQQ) and the iShares U.S. Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: IYW).\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, trimming his stake by 45%. He simultaneously increased his position in the Invesco QQQ Trust by 53%, and he started a new position in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments sold 30,663 shares of Nvidia in the fourth quarter, trimming their stake by 5%. Meanwhile, the pair upped their position in the Invesco QQQ Trust by 75%, such that it now ranks as Two Sigma's second-largest holding. They also increased their stake in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF by 214%.\n\nThose index funds are particularly attractive because they outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. Specifically, while the S&P 500 advanced 228% during that period, the Invesco QQQ Trust returned 440% and the iShares U.S. Technology ETF soared 528%.\n\nHere's what investors should know about those index funds.\n\n1. The Invesco QQQ Trust\n\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust measures the performance of the Nasdaq-100, which tracks the 100 largest companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The index fund is heavily weighted toward the information technology (58.9%) and consumer discretionary (17.9%) sectors, the only two market sectors to beat the S&P 500 over the last decade.\n\nThe 10 largest positions in the Invesco QQQ Trust are detailed by weight below.\n\nMicrosoft: 8.6% Apple: 7.8% Nvidia: 6.2% Alphabet: 5.6% Amazon: 5.6% Meta Platforms: 4.5% Broadcom: 4.3% Tesla: 2.5% Costco Wholesale: 2.4% Netflix: 1.8%\n\nAs mentioned, the Invesco QQQ Trust returned 440% over the last decade, but its outperformance goes even further back. The index returned 1,370% over the last two decades, compounding at 14.3% annually. At that pace, $100 invested weekly (about $434 per month) would now be worth $587,500. By comparison, the same amount invested in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth $333,100.\n\nThe price of that outperformance was volatility. The Invesco QQQ Trust has a three-year beta of 1.19, meaning the index fund moved 119 basis points (1.19 percentage points) for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500. Remember, volatility cuts both ways. It can drive significant outperformance when stocks are going up, but it can lead to significant underperformance when stocks are going down.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe last item of the note is the expense ratio. The Invesco QQQ Trust carries a relatively low expense ratio of 0.2%, meaning the annaul fees would total $20 on every $10,000 invested. That makes this index fund a very compelling option for investors comfortable with volatility.\n\n2. The iShares U.S. Technology ETF\n\nThe iShares U.S. Technology ETF measures the performance of 131 stocks in the information technology sector, letting investors spread money across the consumer electronics, semiconductor, and software markets. The index fund is rebalanced quarterly to ensure (1) no single position is weighted more heavily than 22.5% and (2) the sum of positions exceeding 4.5% do not collectively represent more than 45% of the fund.\n\nThe 10 largest positions in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF are listed by weight below.\n\nMicrosoft: 18.1% Apple: 15.5% Nvidia: 12.6% Alphabet: 5.9% Meta Platforms: 3.6% Broadcom: 2.9% Salesforce: 2.4% Adobe: 2.1% Advanced Micro Devices: 1.9% Qualcomm: 1.9%\n\nThe iShares U.S. Technology ETF has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. I've already mentioned that it beat the market over the last decade, but the index fund also returned 1,240% over the last two decades, compounding at 13.8% annually. At that pace, $100 invested weekly would now be worth $547,900. The same amount invested in an S&P 500 index fund would be worth $333,100.\n\nSimilar to the Invesco QQQ Trust, the price of that outperformance was volatility. The iShares U.S. Technology ETF has a three-year beta of 1.24, meaning it moved 124 basis points for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500. More concerning, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF carries a rather high expense ratio of 0.4%. For context, the average expense ratio on U.S. ETFs was 0.37% in 2022, according to Morningstar.\n\nPersonally, I like the idea of direct exposure to the high-growth information technology sector, but I would rather own the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT). Not only did it perform a little better over the last two decades, compounding at 14.1% annually, but also it carries a much lower expense ratio of 0.1%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Think Nvidia Is Overvalued? Buy This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "Those who invested in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) a few years ago are sitting pretty right now. The tech giant has seen its shares skyrocket, even more so than its otherwise high-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, partly thanks to its artificial intelligence (AI) system sales.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with stocks that crush the market, some investors are now worried about valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 35 -- where the average for the S&P 500 is 20 -- Nvidia's shares don't exactly look cheap.\n\nThe premium might be justified if the chipmaker continues delivering the kinds of results it has lately, but for investors who want a cheaper Magnificent Seven stock that can also allow them to profit from the AI boom, let's consider why Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a solid option.\n\nAI will be a significant growth driver\n\nThe rise of generative AI leader ChatGPT initially spooked Alphabet's shareholders. Some saw the technology as being a Google killer. Alphabet generates the bulk of its revenue from ads on Google, so if it loses significant market share in online search, its financial results will worsen considerably.\n\nThis is a reasonable fear, but Alphabet wasn't worried. The company has been implementing AI within its business for years, including in updates to its Google algorithms.\n\nAlphabet quickly released its ChatGPT competitor, Bard, which has since been rebranded as Gemini. Alphabet's Gemini goes beyond text generation into videos, images, and computer coding. The company is still improving Gemini and other AI models it has developed while integrating various AI features throughout its business to make it more efficient and productive, from online search to advertising services.\n\nThe result should be stronger top-line growth and operating margins. Alphabet also offers various AI services through its cloud business, Google Cloud. As company CEO Sundar Pichai said during Alphabet's first-quarter earnings conference call:\n\nOur differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers.\n\nThe race to develop more sophisticated generative AI platforms should be a growth driver for Alphabet.\n\nMore reasons to buy\n\nAlphabet's forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio is just under 22, which is still higher than the S&P 500's average but much lower than Nvidia's. Perhaps Alphabet's comparatively low P/E reflects the fact that it isn't growing as fast. Still, the business is solid and continues to deliver strong financial results. In the first quarter, the company's total revenue of $80.5 billion increased by a healthy 15.4% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's operating margin landed at 32%, higher than the 25% generated in the prior-year quarter, while its net earnings per share of $1.89 was 61.5% higher. Alphabet has other growth drivers beyond AI, including in streaming with YouTube. The website is the leader in streaming in terms of watch time, though it isn't exactly comparable to platforms like Netflix that offer movies and TV shows.\n\nStill, the increase in viewing time is a magnet for advertisers who will continue to flock to the platform so long as YouTube remains a leader, something that shouldn't change anytime soon. YouTube benefits from the network effect: The more content creators on the platform, the more it becomes attractive to viewers, and vice versa. Alphabet should still have a long runway for growth in this area.\n\nLastly, the company recently announced it was initiating a quarterly dividend per share of $0.20. And for what it's worth, the tech giant will also repurchase $70 billion worth of its shares.\n\nWill Alphabet become a great dividend stock in time? It's too early to tell. However, given the company's solid underlying business, strong cash flow generation, and multiple growth avenues, it has the tools to be an excellent dividend payer. Incidentally, these qualities also make the stock a great buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia: Billionaire Dan Loeb Is Betting on This Dividend-Paying Magnificent Seven Stock to Win the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race Instead",
        "content": "Many savvy technology investors and entrepreneurs agree: The AI revolution is the real deal, and will likely transform our lives in the years to come. But unlike other disruptive revolutions, this one should actually benefit many current incumbent technology giants. These powerful companies are, after all, the only ones with the massive financial war chests and diverse technology know-how to deploy this extremely expensive and difficult technology at scale.\n\nNo wonder the Magnificent Seven Stocks have taken off recently. But while AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) gets most of the attention, its stock has also taken off into the stratosphere and trades at a high valuation for a chip stock.\n\nThat's why billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is betting on one of the cheapest Mag Seven stocks as his new AI bet instead.\n\nThird Point Invests in Alphabet in Q1\n\nIn his first quarter letter to shareholders, Loeb detailed the firm's new buy of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) as a cheap way to play the AI race.\n\nIt should be noted that Loeb also said AI-related bets comprised about half of Third Point's holdings today. So, Loeb is clearly bullish on this powerful trend, which accelerated following the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that AI stocks rarely come cheap these days. But as Loeb spelled out in his Q1 letter, Google's initial missteps in the rollout of its large language model, Gemini, which seeks to compete head-to-head against ChatGPT, provided that window of opportunity.\n\nThe much-anticipated rollout of Gemini in February didn't go quite as planned. When prompted by early users to create historical images, Gemini often depicted racially diverse figures in historical settings in which it was not historically accurate to do so, and these politically charged inaccuracies were well-publicized. In response, Google's stock fell to a year-to-date low in early March.\n\nHowever, Loeb wrote in his letter:\n\nAssigning primacy to a small operational misstep while demoting the fact that the company has been building world-class capabilities in AI for over a decade, created an attractive entry point for a long-term investor. While it is easy to forget that the original paper on Transformers which paved the way for the rise of LLMs was published by Google engineers, and that it was Alphabet that built two of the leading AI research organizations (Google Brain and DeepMind), when news reports previewed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) intentions to embed Gemini into iOS, investors paid attention. We believe the moment when Gemini takes a seat at the economic table is approaching.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Loeb see Alphabet's AI team eventually working out the kinks in Gemini to make it a pre-eminent LLM, Loeb also notes AI has the potential to greatly enhance Alphabet's current core businesses across Search, YouTube, Android, cloud and others. And rather than being threatened by AI, Loeb thinks Google Search could actually become even more of a trusted source of information, as the post-AI internet becomes full of \"ad-supported content full of fakes.\" Dan Loeb bet on Alphabet in the first quarter 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bet pays off\n\nLoeb had good reason to expound on Third Point's Alphabet position in the first quarter. Five days before his letter came out, Alphabet reported first quarter earnings that handily beat analyst expectations. In addition, the company announced its first-ever dividend payment, which amounts to a 0.5% dividend yield at this stock price.\n\nThe dividend payment was interesting, as management showed confidence in its growth path while also giving a nod to the company's newfound focus on operational efficiency since the downturn of 2022.\n\nIn any case, Alphabet rallied higher following the April 25 release, and is now up about 20% on the year and roughly 25% from it March lows.\n\nHow Alphabet's stock looks after the rally\n\nEven after its recent rally, Alphabet trades at less than 26 times trailing earnings and just 21 times its 2025 earnings estimates. That's still among the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Not only that, but Alphabet also has a substantial $108 billion cash hoard, and it's still losing over $1 billion every quarter on its \"Other Bets\" segment.\n\nStripping out those two factors, and Alphabet's core Search, YouTube, Android, and Cloud businesses are trading at an even cheaper valuation than Alphabet's headline P/E ratio would suggest. In this Alphabet shareholder's opinion, investors would do well to follow Loeb into the stock for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Once confined to sci-fi movies and dreamers, robotics stocks have revolutionized what’s possible. These companies have transformed industries from manufacturing to healthcare, creating efficiencies in areas where humans simply can’t achieve a certain level of precision. With the market surging, investors looking at this sector could be in line to see impressive upside, assuming this bull market rally continues in these names.\n\nThe U.S. economy saw rapid growth in robotics and automation across sectors. Companies continue to invest heavily, anticipating improved quality and efficiency. Retail and consumer goods have led this wave, with significant capital investments in most major companies already planned for the next five years. Despite challenges like high upfront costs, robotics promise a resilient industrial landscape. For those bullish on on-shoring trends, that’s a great thing.\n\nThe global robotics market is projected to hit $95.93 billion by 2029, fueling confidence in the top three robotics stocks to buy. Market Research Future predicts it will exceed $286 billion by 2032, driven by AI technologies like natural language processing and machine learning. Investors should explore the companies driving this transformative industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a worth of $134 billion as a medtech company focusing on advanced surgical robotics, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is first on the list. After a slight dip, its stock fell nearly 7%, but with da Vinci surgeries rebounding in China, there’s potential for higher highs. Despite fluctuations, the recent clearance of its fifth-generation robot and ongoing international expansion indicate strong forward growth prospects.\n\nIntuitive Surgical’s EVP and Chief Digital Officer Brian Miller recently expressed that the data from the new da Vinci 5 surgical robotics system will revolutionize patient care. Miller highlighted the DV5 as Intuitive’s most precise robot, with enhanced sensors and motors. He also highlighted how data can help characterize procedures and improve patient outcomes.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Intuitive exceeded earnings expectations and announced $1.50 per share. Sales came in at $1.89 billion. Earnings and sales saw a 53% and 11.5% increase, respectively. Additionally, procedures using its da Vinci systems grew by 16%, beating forecasts, with a compound annual growth rate of 17%. All these numbers make ISRG stock a compelling option to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nRTX (RTX) Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRTX (NYSE:RTX), formerly Raytheon, offers aerospace and defense solutions, potentially benefiting from Middle East tensions. Analysts rate RTX stock as a Hold with a $104.33 target, but this may change with geopolitical shifts. With a 2.32% yield and $5.38 in earnings per share forecasted, RTX has emerged as a blue-chip dividend stock given the recent and increasing geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nRTX faced declining profit margins in two of its main businesses. Most notably, its Pratt & Whitney segment dropped 6.4% year-over-year. Despite last year’s earnings of $2.23 per share, RTX anticipates a rebound to at least $5.25 per share this year, doubling its previous performance.\n\nAnalysts also predict a significant margin increase at both Collins and Pratt, especially as issues with Pratt & Whitney engines have peaked and should improve throughout the year. Although RTX’s stock has risen about 50% from its October 2023 lows, trading at 40x earnings and 2x sales, it’s no longer considered cheap. Wells Fargo’s (NYSE:WFC) Matthew Akers reduced RTX’s price target by $1 to $119, maintaining an Overweight rating.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the top semiconductor company in the world, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its excellent AI chips and blockchain technology, but these chips have also been integrated into robotics. GPUs are crucial for robotics, as they create future AI applications. Investors are always confident about Nvidia and its role in the AI revolution, driving a 126% increase in revenue.\n\nThe company also introduced the “Nvidia Inference Microservice” revenue-generating software for its enterprise software subscription. The company aims to transition from a microchip provider to a platform provider. In fact, it announced a $200 million AI center construction plan in Indonesia to expand further in Asia.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Nvidia aced its numbers, showing a 265% increase in sales and 769% in growth year-over-year. Guidance was also impeccable, giving investors more reasons to stay optimistic about the AI company. Nvidia’s unveiling of its Blackwell series of AI microchips in March further boosted enthusiasm for its stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Stocks to Buy Now That Could Help You Retire a Millionaire",
        "content": "It's possible to become a millionaire by investing in stocks. But to do so, you'll need to earn strong returns for many years. And to do that, you'll want to invest in businesses with powerful competitive advantages and attractive long-term growth opportunities.\n\nTo aid your search for these fortune-builders, here are three exceptional companies to consider investing in today.\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nWarren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is one of the best-performing stocks of all time. From 1964 to 2023, the venerable investment conglomerate generated astounding returns of 4,384,748% for its shareowners. And its stock price is up another 11% so far in 2024.\n\nBerkshire is a financial fortress with dependable revenue streams and more than $160 billion in cash reserves as of the end of 2023. With more than 60 operating businesses in industries spanning from insurance to transportation to energy to retail, Buffett's $867 billion behemoth is perhaps the most diversified enterprise in the market today.\n\nBerkshire's subsidiaries were chosen by Buffett for their strong competitive positions and attractive expansion prospects. Collectively, they produce annual operating earnings topping $37 billion.\n\nBuffett likes to invest this cash in new value-creating opportunities, whether that be acquiring businesses outright or buying their shares in the stock market. Berkshire's portfolio holds large positions in top-tier companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and Occidental Petroleum.\n\nNotably, Berkshire has a well-crafted succession plan in place for when the legendary investor eventually retires. Buffett's trusted lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, will manage the company's investment portfolio after he steps down, and longtime Berkshire executive Greg Abel will succeed Buffet as CEO. With the next generation of its leadership team already in place, Berkshire is well-situated to reward its shareholders with wealth-building gains for many years.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nAs businesses shift more of their operations to the cloud, effective cybersecurity solutions are only becoming more vital. In this increasingly dangerous realm, CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) stands between its customers and the cyber threats that would do them harm.\n\nCrowdStrike excels at safeguarding devices known as endpoints. Think laptops, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) appliances. The trend toward distributed workforces is making effective endpoint security indispensable for more companies -- and fueling demand for the cyber sentinel's industry-leading services.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's artificial intelligence (AI) expertise gives it an edge over the competition. Its Falcon platform constantly grows smarter as it analyzes more than 2 trillion cyber events each day. When this AI-powered guardian detects a new threat, it immediately updates its network to defend its customers from harm.\n\nCrowdStrike's business, in turn, is booming. Its revenue and free cash flow leaped 36% and 39%, respectively, to $3.1 billion and $938 million in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31.\n\nChief financial officer Burt Podbere sees a path to $10 billion in annual recurring revenue in the coming years. Yet CrowdStrike appears poised for even grander ambitions. The cybersecurity leader expects its total addressable market to grow to a staggering $225 billion by 2028.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI across industries promises to be one of the most lucrative opportunities for investors. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge technology powers the most advanced AI applications -- and demand for its industry-leading chips is soaring.\n\nTech giants Microsoft, Alphabet, and Tesla depend on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to power their cloud computing platforms and AI operations. Demand for the semiconductor titan's chips is so strong that it's struggling to satisfy it. Nvidia's sales surged 265% year over year to $22.1 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 28. Its operating income, in turn, skyrocketed by a stunning 983% to $13.6 billion.\n\nSales of AI chips are projected to remain robust for the foreseeable future. The cloud giants are expected to spend heavily to upgrade their data centers as they shift to accelerated computing systems that can run AI workloads more efficiently. All told, the market for AI chips could grow to a whopping $400 billion by 2027, up from roughly $45 billion in 2024, according to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia is the supplier of choice for these large chip buyers. Its new Blackwell processors should deliver substantial performance gains and cost savings compared to previous-generation chips. Critically, Blackwell's benefits include the potential to reduce the amount of energy consumed by AI applications by as much as 25 times.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is investing aggressively in software that can make it easier for its customers to train and run AI models. Just days ago, Nvidia struck a deal to acquire Run:ai, which provides tools that help companies optimize their computing infrastructure for AI workloads. Nvidia's efforts to bolster its software offerings should further strengthen its competitive position within the rapidly expanding AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Use cases revolving around artificial intelligence (AI) are exploding. Every industry is seeking to leverage the technology in some fashion. While the rapid pace of innovation is exciting, it's worth noting that some AI applications will be more impactful than others.\n\nOne key opportunity is autonomous driving. Once a concept reserved for science fiction, some of the world's largest companies, including Tesla and Alphabet, are now leading the charge in the development of self-driving technology.\n\nHowever, there is another member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" that is also playing an integral role at the intersection of AI and automobiles: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nHow does autonomous driving work?\n\nAt a high level, modern vehicles are becoming giant computers with built-in software learning to operate these vehicles just like a human driver. This process is an example of machine learning.\n\nTesla's cars, for example, come equipped with an array of cameras and sensors. These devices are constantly monitoring road maps, weather conditions, traffic patterns, and more.\n\nThese data are then sent back to a supercomputer that processes the information at scale. The end result is that Tesla has created a software program it can integrate into its fleet that offers owners the option to have the car drive itself. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow is Nvidia involved in autonomous driving?\n\nNvidia is mostly known for its graphics processing units (GPU) and data center services. GPUs are used for a variety of generative AI applications, including autonomous driving. These semiconductor chips are capable of immense computing power. Their ability to process loads of information at a high rate makes them necessary to AI models.\n\nRight now, Nvidia's most in-demand GPUs include its A100 and H100 chips. During Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk spoke about the company's self-driving technology. He told investors that Tesla currently utilizes 35,000 H100 chips, and \"we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year.\"\n\nAlthough the exact price point of the H100 fluctuates, multiple media outlets report these chips can cost around $40,000. Using the figures from above, that means Tesla could be spending $2 billion on Nvidia GPUs just this year.\n\nConsidering Nvidia owns an estimated 80% of the AI chip market, it's likely the vendor of choice among the various companies pursuing self-driving technology. Nvidia is looking at a multibillion-dollar opportunity from autonomous driving alone.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a good buy right now?\n\nThe chip giant has been at the center of the AI-fueled hype in the stock market. Shares soared 239% in 2023, and they are up another 70% so far this year. Investors should be aware of the risks from buying into momentum, but as Nvidia's revenue soars to record levels, profits and free cash flow have climbed even faster.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the development of autonomous driving technology is still in its early stages, I see the trends above as encouraging. Widespread adoption of self-driving cars is years away, and yet, Nvidia is already making billions off the opportunity, one that should only grow as autonomous driving becomes increasingly mainstream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Has 39% of His Portfolio in These 3 Companies",
        "content": "Investors have long observed the stock selections of Stanley Druckenmiller. The billionaire investor built his fortune in a fund he founded in 1981, Duquesne Capital Management. Although he closed that fund in 2010, he maintains about $3.4 billion in assets through his Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nDruckenmiller's top holdings, as shown in the 13-F filing for the fourth quarter of 2023, appear to reflect an interest in leading companies in cutting-edge industries and technologies. Let's review three of them.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is Druckenmiller's largest investment, accounting for just over 16% of his portfolio. As the leading producer of AI-enabled chips, it has achieved triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters as companies scramble to buy the needed hardware to capitalize on the AI revolution.\n\nEstimates on the degree of Nvidia's dominance vary, though most analysts agree that it controls at least 80% of the AI chip market.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has responded to AI chip competitors by releasing Blackwell. This combines six accelerated computing technologies into one product, offering similar functionality at 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its previous AI chip release.\n\nInvestors may also notice how Druckenmiller structures his Nvidia investment into two holdings. One is Nvidia stock, which is 9% of the overall portfolio.\n\nHowever, Duquesne invested an additional 7% of the portfolio in Nvidia call options. These are highly leveraged investment products. Since they have an expiration date and can easily fall to $0, they are unsuitable for most investors. Also, the size of that investment may change significantly when the next 13-F release in May shows Druckenmiller's first-quarter 2024 holdings.\n\nNonetheless, the aggressiveness of that options investment implies a strong belief that Nvidia will rise significantly in the near term. That additional factor that could help persuade some investors to add Nvidia shares.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nDuquesne bought Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock in the first quarter of 2014, around the time Satya Nadella became CEO. Although the fund was in and out of the stock over the years, the apparent bet on Nadella's leadership has paid off handsomely for Druckenmiller. The stock has risen by about 11-fold since Nadella became CEO.\n\nNadella transformed Microsoft into a cloud company as changing technologies and rising competition had made the dominance of Windows and Office less relevant. Its Azure platform has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon's AWS, which spearheaded the cloud industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the emergence of AI has furthered Microsoft's competitive advantage. AI relies heavily on the cloud to run applications, and its relationship with OpenAI has given Alphabet its first serious challenge to Google Search in years as Microsoft's Bing leverages this technology.\n\nToday, Microsoft is again the world's largest company, with a market cap of about $3 trillion. That growth is likely a huge factor in it becoming 12% of the Duquesne portfolio. With AI becoming an essential technology, this investment should continue to move higher.\n\n3. Coupang\n\nDuquesne first bought Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) in the first quarter of 2021, likely around the time of its IPO in March of that year.\n\nAs the leading e-commerce company in South Korea, it is not as well-known to U.S. investors. However, it has stood out in the country with its end-to-end logistics network that can deliver anywhere in the country within hours. Additionally, it competes in e-commerce in Taiwan and operates a video streaming service.\n\nSince the 2021 IPO, revenue has grown by double digits, and Coupang became profitable on an annual basis in 2023. Nonetheless, Druckenmiller may now regret his timing as he bought the stock at around the time of the IPO. Due to the steep declines during the 2022 bear market, the stock is down more than 50% since the IPO. Still, he has steadily added shares since then, and it makes up 11% of his portfolio.\n\nThe investment could eventually pay off. Analysts forecast 15% earnings growth this year and 110% in 2025. Also, at a $41 billion market capitalization, it is a small fraction of Amazon's $1.9 trillion size. That could give investors a second chance for those who missed the opportunity in Amazon.\n\nAs Coupang reinforces its dominance in South Korean e-commerce and develops new revenue sources, Druckenmiller could eventually be rewarded for his patience.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 23 most profitable stocks of the last 12 months. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.\n\nThe United States stock market has come a long way since the turn of the millennium more than two decades ago. Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.\n\nInvestors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.\n\nThe present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\n\nThe fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\n\n“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income. The Finance Charts database was then used to identify firms with the best net income growth in the past twenty years. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 23 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years\n\nAn overhead view of a bustling stock exchange, with brokers and traders exchanging stocks.\n\nMost Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years\n\n23.

FICO reported solid 4Q results, with revenue beating expectations, partially mitigated by a slight shortfall in EPS. Total revenue sustained low-double-digit growth in the quarter, with Scores up 12% year-over-year and Software up 11%. Software annual recurring revenue growth accelerated to 22% year-over-year in 4Q from 20% in 3Q. FICO also guided to double-digit revenue and EPS growth in fiscal year 2024.”\n\n22. ANSYS, Inc.

(NASDAQ:IDXX) with 2.7 million shares worth more than $1.5 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Conestoga Capital Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX): IDXX is the industry leader in providing instruments (and consumables) used in diagnostics, detection, and information systems for veterinary, food, and water testing applications. Earnings for the quarter were mixed, as IDXX revenue came in lower than expected on weaker veterinary clinic traffic. However, pricing came in better than expected and shares rebounded after a significant drawdown from July highs.”\n\n20. Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nNet Income: $1.4 Billion\n\nRoper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) provides software, engineered products and solutions.

(NYSE:ROP), compared to 42 in the previous quarter worth $2.4 billion.\n\n19. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nNet Income: $1.6 Billion\n\nMonster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of energy drink beverages and concentrates in the United States and internationally. On February 29, investment advisory Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 42 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.4 billion in Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), the same as in the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.\n\n18. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nNet Income: $1.6 Billion\n\nMoody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) operates as an integrated risk assessment firm worldwide. On February 14, investment advisory UBS maintained a Neutral rating on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stock and raised the price target to $380 from $355.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Nebraska-based investment firm Berkshire Hathaway is a leading shareholder in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) with 24 million shares worth more than $9.6 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, L1 Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyse Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”\n\n17. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nNet Income: $1.7 Billion\n\nPaychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a New York-based company that provides human resource, payroll, and other services to businesses. In late December, investment advisory Stifel maintained a Hold rating on Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) stock and raised the price target to $130 from $124.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Select Equity Group is a leading shareholder in the firm with 2.3 million shares worth more than $281 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”\n\n16. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\n\nNet Income: $1.9 Billion\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a real estate investment trust that owns and runs self-storage facilities. On March 7, investment advisory Jefferies maintained a Buy rating on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock and raised the price target to $331 from $315.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $678 million in Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), up from 24 in the preceding quarter worth $1.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)  was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the most recently reported quarter, business results for Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.”\n\n15. Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nNet Income: $2.3 Billion\n\nSimon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is a real estate investment trust engaged in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations. On February 28, investment advisory Evercore ISI maintained an Equal Weight rating on Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) stock and raised the price target to $150 from $142.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 27 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $320 million in Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), the same as in the preceding quarter worth $240 million.\n\nJust like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is one of the most profitable stocks of the last 12 months.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&P Global Inc. gave back some gains from earlier this year due to investor concerns that rising interest rates will weigh on future debt issuance and asset-based fees. Management also removed its 2026 revenue target for the ESG segment due to a more uncertain regulatory landscape and political climate. On a positive note, S&P Global reported strong second quarter financial results, with 7% adjusted revenue growth and 11% EPS growth as ratings issuance returned to growth for the first time in six quarters. Management maintained fullyear guidance as a more favorable outlook for the Ratings and Indices segments offset slower growth in the Market Intelligence segment. We continue to own the stock due to the company’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”\n\n14. Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nNet Income: $2.3 Billion\n\nMicrochip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. On February 2, investment advisory Needham maintained a Buy rating on Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) stock and raised the price target to $90 from $85.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Sydney-based investment firm Platinum Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) with 1.5 million shares worth more than $141 million.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.”\n\n13. KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 55\n\nNet Income: $2.7 Billion\n\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) markets process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor industry. On March 5, investment advisory UBS maintained a Neutral rating on KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) stock and raised the price target to $760 from $605.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.3 billion in KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), compared to 49 in the previous quarter worth $1.4 billion.\n\n12. Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nNet Income: $2.8 Billion\n\nAnalog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) makes and sells semiconductor products. It operates from Massachusetts. On March 4, investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Neutral rating on Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock with a price target of $205.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 62 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $4.4 billion in Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), compared to 64 the preceding quarter worth $4.5 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Madison Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the semiconductor industry, demand is closely tied to the economic cycle, and industry order patterns are magnified by its complex supply chain. Furthermore, it’s a capital and technology intensive industry, resulting in frequent overcapacity and product obsolescence. For these reasons, we shied away from any investment in the industry for many years. However, several years ago, we felt that segments of the industry had developed strong enough moats to merit investment under the right conditions. We made one investment (Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in Large Cap) that we thought was compelling, but it wasn’t until late 2021 when the semiconductor industry entered a severe downturn, that we began purchasing semiconductor stocks in earnest. Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.\n\nHowever, we have not changed our view on the long-term attractiveness of the industry segments in which they operate, nor on the normalized earning power of these companies five to ten years out. Thus, we have been consistently adding to our exposure for the past two years, which, in addition to Analog Devices, now includes Microchip Technology (Mid Cap), MKS Instruments (Mid Cap), and Texas Instruments (Large Cap), the last of which was a new purchase in 2023. Each of these has wide and deep moats, top-notch management teams, and strong secular growth prospects. We expect our investments here to ultimately work out for us, but they are examples of how unpredictable, cyclical factors can overwhelm other factors in the short term.”\n\n11. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nNet Income: $3.6 Billion\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a biotech firm that develops therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. On February 20, investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stock with a price target of $440.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 62 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX), compared to 57 in the previous quarter worth $1.5 billion.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the most profitable stocks of the last 12 months.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Aristotle Atlantic Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) develops drugs for treating cystic fibrosis, cancer, inflammatory bowel, autoimmune disease and neurological disorders. The biotechnology company has four commercial drugs used to treat cystic fibrosis. Vertex has other drugs in development, including additional cystic fibrosis treatments and medications addressing sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and pain.\n\nVertex is the global leader in treating cystic fibrosis and has additionally built a robust pipeline in several therapeutic areas. Late-stage studies in acute and neuropathic pain are expected to be another catalyst for the company. We believe Vertex’s valuation is attractive and at a discount relative to their 5-year historical average. Additionally, the company is well capitalized, with roughly $12.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet.”\n\n10. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 59\n\nNet Income: $3.9 Billion\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for treating various diseases worldwide. On February 27, investment advisory RBC Capital maintained an Outperform rating on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) stock and raised the price target to $1,184 from $1,096.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 59 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), compared to 50 in the preceding quarter worth $1.7 billion.\n\n9. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 55\n\nNet Income: $5.6 Billion\n\nGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and commercializes medicines. On March 4, investment advisory Wells Fargo maintained an Equal Weight rating on Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) stock and lowered the price target to $77 from $84.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm AQR Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) with 3.8 million shares worth more than $312 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”\n\n8. Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 55\n\nNet Income: $6.5 Billion\n\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers. On March 4, investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Neutral rating on Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stock with a price target of $170.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) with 2.7 million shares worth more than $461 million.\n\n7. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nNet Income: $8.1 Billion\n\nAltria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 42 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1 billion in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared to 40 the preceding quarter worth $565 million.\n\n6. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nNet Income: $13.4 Billion\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) makes and sells networking and other products. On February 15, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDividend Contenders List Ranked By Yield: Top 25 13 Best Mining Stocks To Buy Now 11 High Growth Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure.

For one, more speculative artificial intelligence plays are likely to be hard hit in a widespread downturn.\n\nIf a rocky market compels investors to seek safer harbors, they will likely flee in droves from these risky names. Not only that, even some of the more established companies capitalizing on the generative AI trend may experience some hard turbulence if the market turns bearish once again.\n\nNamely, higher-quality AI stocks that have become very pricey due to investor perceptions about future growth. If market and/or economic uncertainty crops up again, these names could experience moderate-to-high moves to the downside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following seven artificial intelligence plays should be considered AI stocks to avoid right now. Each one fits into either of these categories.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nSo far in 2024, excitement about C3.ai (NYSE:AI) has continued to wane. Shares in this enterprise artificial intelligence software company initially appeared to be in rebound mode following its quarterly earnings release in February.\n\nBut while better-than-expected results and upbeat statements from CEO Tom Siebel helped to fuel a post-earnings short-squeeze rally, since then AI stock has coughed back these gains, and then some. If that’s not bad enough, C3.ai, at $23 per share today, could be at risk of falling further towards pre-AI boom prices of around $10 per share.\n\nWhy? The preceding earnings release took place during a wave of AI mania, resulting in an overboard reaction to better-than-feared news. Following its upcoming earnings release on May 29, a more skittish market may focus on the negative aspects of the C3.ai story, like continued operating losses and uncertain road to profitability.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first, you may find it odd for me to call Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) one of the AI stocks to avoid. Yet even after dropping more than 35% since March, more downside may lie ahead. Blame it on shifting sentiment.\n\nEarlier this year, there was plenty of hope and hype about AMD’s MI300 Instinct AI accelerator chip sales handily beating the company’s own sales forecasts. Now, however, there’s little of this hope and hype left. In AMD’s most recent earnings release, the company reported results and guidance in-line with expectations, but investors reacted negatively to the company’s latest MI300 sales forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile upping it from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, remember that external forecasts had been calling for as much as $8 billion in sales. Although bullishness for AMD stock could rebound once its rollout of AI-PC chips is in full swing, for now stay away.\n\nBigBear.ai Holdings (BBAI) BigBear.ai (BBAI) is a leading provider of high-speed decision-making technologies. They specialize in AI-driven analytics and solutions for critical missions\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nBigBear.ai Holdings (NYSE:BBAI) is a prime example of the riskier, more speculative AI stocks you should avoid with a capital “A” in the current market environment. At various times since the start of the gen AI boom in late 2022/early 2023, shares in this provider of AI-powered decision intelligence solutions has experienced bouts of meme frenzy.\n\nThe most recent of these frenzies took place during early March, at the peak of the market’s mania for AI stocks. Since then, BBAI stock has taken an outsized tumble between then and now, as investors have become increasingly cautious about the AI investing trend.\n\nYet while trading for less than a third of its early-March highs, downside risk remains massive, as poor fiscal performance persists. As InvestorPlace Earnings reported May 2, BigBear.ai’s revenue for the preceding quarter fell far short of forecasts, and the company reported substantially higher losses.\n\nBeamr Imaging (BMR) Render Video Encoder time HD. BMR stock\n\nSource: Andre_Carvalho / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to BigBear.ai, Beamr Imaging (NASDAQ:BMR) is one of the speculative AI stocks to avoid at all costs. Sure, this AI-powered video optimization technology firm appears to be going places. News of a collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has helped to burnish its “AI rising star” reputation.\n\nBut while this Nvidia news may have helped BMR stock bolt from around $2 to as much as $34.94 per share, it has since tumbled back down to $6 per share. A further retreat may be in its future. The company remains years away from generating material earnings, much less hitting profitability.\n\nHence, Beamr Imaging will likely lean on dilutive funding sources to sustain operations. Back in March, the company filed a prospectus to sell up to $250 million in shares and warrants. This represents a figure many times that of BMR’s current market cap of around $87.7 million.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn paper, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), looks like a very promising turnaround play, thanks to two major catalysts on tap that could in theory result in a massive comeback for the chip maker. First, the company’s big bet on becoming a major chip foundry.\n\nSecond, Intel’s efforts to cash in on the AI chips boom. Yet while there are catalysts on tap, the question is when will they fully play out. As I pointed out in a recent INTC stock article, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says that the foundry may not become profitable until 2030.\n\nFor now, even success with AI chips may not be enough to counter foundry losses. Even success in its AI chip efforts may not be enough to counter further foundry troubles. As I argued before, stay away from Intel, at least until the stock, trading at a forward multiple in the high-20s today, becomes far cheaper.\n\nLemonade (LMND) Lemonade stock logo displayed on smartphone laying on top of computer keyboard.\n\nSource: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com\n\nBack when it went public in 2020, Lemonade (NYSE:LMND) wowed the market, with its potential to “disrupt” the insurance industry through the use of an AI to mitigate claims losses and to automate customer service.\n\nLMND stock eventually crashed and burned due to poor results and the 2022 bear market, but over the past year shares have experienced a 62.6% rebound. Better than expected results in recent quarters, including last quarter, has been driving this, not AI mania.\n\nHowever, despite improving numbers, this is still one of the AI stocks to avoid. Even as the insuretech firm is moderately beating forecasts, losses are still expected to run high during the rest of 2024, and into 2025. If the company quarters, improvements to revenue and profitability fail to arrive, or come up short, this could sour sentiment for LMND, causing a reversal for this partial recovery.\n\nVeritone (VERI)\n\nEven as the AI growth trend blossomed in 2023 and 2024, Veritone (NASDAQ:VERI), which tumbled in 2021 and 2022, continued to drop like a stone. This makes sense, given the AI computing solutions company’s poor fiscal performance.\n\nHowever, in March and April, VERI stock experienced a short-lived resurgence. Veritone skyrocketed from under $2 per share to as much as $7.76 per share. While not certain, given Veritone’s elevated short interest (nearly 20% of float) at the time, this may have been due to a short squeeze.\n\nVERI stock has since fallen back to around $3.25 per share. Based on Seeking Alpha commentator Michael Wiggins De Oliveira’s downbeat take on the stock, don’t expect a recovery. Per De Oliveira, Veritone has struggled with achieving consistent revenue growth. There are also other risks like customer concentration. With this in mind, there’s little reason to “buy the dip” here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has crushed the broader market handsomely over the past five years with eye-popping gains of more than 1,800% -- which is significantly higher than the S&P 500 index's gains of 71% -- and a big reason behind the chip giant's terrific surge is its dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, can Nvidia sustain its AI-driven growth for the next five years and deliver more gains to investors? Let's find out.\n\nThe AI chip market's massive growth should be a long-term tailwind for Nvidia\n\nAllied Market Research estimates that the global AI chip market was worth just under $15 billion in 2022. However, by 2032, the market research firm expects sales of AI chips to generate annual revenue of nearly $384 billion. Nvidia is in the driver's seat in this space, controlling an estimated 94% of the AI chip market last year, per Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities.\n\nNvidia's first-mover advantage in AI chips has paid off handsomely for the company. Its graphics cards have been extremely popular and deployed by major cloud computing providers and start-ups to train AI models, including ChatGPT. As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue has been growing at a stunning rate. In fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, 2024, the company reported data center revenue of $47.5 billion, up a massive 217% from the previous year.\n\nNvidia, however, is expected to cede some ground in the AI chip market to rivals. Rakesh, for instance, expects the company's AI chip share to slip to 75% over the next couple of years as the likes of Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) bring competitive offerings into the market. AMD witnessed an 80% year-over-year increase in sales of its data center chips in the first quarter of 2024 to $2.3 billion, thanks to the growing demand for its AI accelerators.\n\nThe Nvidia competitor expects to sell $4 billion worth of AI graphics cards this year, which is double its initial estimate of $2 billion. Analysts, however, expect AMD to end the year with as much as $8 billion in revenue from sales of AI-focused data center chips.\n\nIntel management also pointed out on the company's latest earnings conference call that its new Gaudi 3 data center accelerators are gaining traction and could generate $500 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, followed by a stronger showing next year. Nvidia, however, is expected to be in a league of its own.\n\nAccording to market research firm Omdia, the chipmaker could sell $87 billion worth of data center graphics cards this year. That would be a huge jump from the $34 billion the company generated through data center chip sales last year. Even better, Rakesh forecasts Nvidia could sell $280 billion worth of data center graphics cards in 2027 despite the potential loss in market share. That's not surprising, considering how fast this space is growing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn simple words, there is enough room for Nvidia to grow in the AI chip market even if the competition gets stronger. Throw in the potential growth the company could witness in other markets, such as gaming, it is easy to see why analysts expect Nvidia to clock healthy earnings growth for the next five years.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect over the next five years?\n\nConsensus estimates predict Nvidia's earnings will increase at an annual rate of just over 35% for the next five years. Based on the company's fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.96 per share, its bottom line could jump to $58.11 per share after five years, assuming it does increase at the predicted rate.\n\nThe good part is that the company seems capable of delivering the growth that analysts are expecting from it based on the points discussed above and Nvidia's commanding pricing power in the AI chip space. Not surprisingly, analysts bumped up Nvidia's earnings estimates significantly for the current and the next two fiscal years, as seen in the chart below. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's earnings could indeed touch the projected $58.11 per share after five years. Multiplying the projected earnings with Nvidia's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39 suggests that its stock price could hit $2,266 per share (barring any stock splits or other events) after five years. That would translate into a jump of 162% from current levels.\n\nSo, investors who haven't bought this AI stock yet can still consider doing so, as its impressive rally seems sustainable over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The recent AI boom has many companies reaching new heights, and I think the sector still has plenty of room to mature.\n\nStill, prudent investors must be careful when picking their tech stocks, as runaway valuations are possible. With the help of certain screening methods, investors looking for the best tech stocks out there have ways of figuring out which ones deserve a buy.\n\nTo come up with the list, I screened for undervalued tech companies with the following metrics:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPositive year-to-date (YTD) returns 12-month forward PE lower than the S&P 500 Information Technology estimated average of 27.3\n\nI sorted the companies based on their YTD performance from lowest to highest to find the best tech stocks to buy that can turbocharge your portfolio.\n\nGoDaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown for its domain registry and website-building capability, GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) offers its businesses, entrepreneurs, organizations and developers a one-stop-shop solution to build and host websites. The company operations are split into two main segments:\n\nCore Platform (Core): offers domain renewal, sales and aftermarket sale of domains Applications and Commerce (A&C): offers the company’s website building products, proprietary software, email and productivity solutions\n\nGoDaddy recently released the GoValue API subscription service, allowing its customers to use its machine-learning model trained on over 65 million data points and generate a market value for a domain using the company’s collection of Afternic and GoDaddy domain transactions.\n\nIn addition, the company announced GoDaddy Airo, which allows clients to use generative AI to assist them in their online ventures and quickly build their logos, websites and more.\n\nLooking at GoDaddy’s FY’23 results, we can see why the company is gaining momentum. Application and commerce revenue grew 13% year-over-year (YOY), while net income grew by 295%, reaching $1.4 billion.\n\nWith a 12-month forward of 25.22, this undervalued gem offers investors a chance to turbocharge their portfolio performance.\n\nKarooooo (KARO) APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKarooooo (NASDAQ:KARO) is a fleet management software firm based in Singapore that offers a cloud-based platform for on-the-ground logistics operations.

Here’s why I think it will continue.\n\nThe company reported a strong Q3’24, with total revenue growing 16% YOY and consolidated EPS growth of 35%. These results were driven by solid results from Cartrack’s subscriber base increase, growth in annual recurring revenue and Carzuka’s earnings growth.\n\nWith a 12-month forward PE of 24.07, Karooooo offers an attractive proposition for investors looking to add tech stocks to grow their portfolio.

Dell operates in two primary segments:\n\nInfrastructure Solutions Group (ISG): offers digital transformation using artificial intelligence, cloud environments and machine learning Client Solutions Group (CSG): offers notebook computers, workstations, desktops and peripherals\n\nThe company has made various strides in taking advantage of the AI boom with its AI solutions. Its recent announcement about strengthening its collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) aims to strengthen the global adoption of AI for enterprises.\n\nWith the global push for AI, it’s no wonder the company has gained strong momentum, with DELL stock up 64% YTD.\n\nLooking at its financials, overall revenue for FY’24 decreased. Conversely, diluted earnings per share increased by 35% YOY. In addition, the company has announced a 20% increase in annual cash dividends to $1.78 per share, highlighting confidence in its cash flow capabilities and business.\n\nDespite the market view that tech companies are overvalued, DELL stock’s 12-month forward PE is still trading around 16.39.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence continues to be a major driver of the stock market. Expectations are that AI will eventually touch every aspect of our lives, opening up a huge new area of the tech sector. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that AI will become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032. Many forecasts put the market even higher in less than 10 years. The explosive growth has made AI stocks red-hot and in demand among investors.\n\nBut caution is needed. Not every company and stock associated with AI is worth an investment of capital. Already, winners and losers are emerging in the AI space. Companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pulling ahead while others like C3.ai (NYSE:AI) are being left in the dust. The trick for investors is to separate the proverbial wheat from the chafe when it comes to AI stocks and the industry’s future.\n\nHere is a stock market crash warning: Don’t get caught holding these three AI stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nSoftware company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is already a bad stock to own. In a market crash it could be downright awful. ADBE stock plunged 12% after the company’s latest financial results were issued in March. While the company behind popular products such as Photoshop and Illustrator managed to beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, its forward guidance disappointed analysts and investors. Through four months of the year, Adobe’s stock is down by 16%.\n\nAdobe is doing its best to add AI technologies to its suite of software products. It recently unveiled an AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps. However, somewhat ironically, it appears that AI is posing an existential threat to the company. ADBE stock started to sell off last year when privately held OpenAI introduced “Sora,” an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. Some analysts feel that it is only a matter of time before AI replaces Adobe’s suite of creative software products.\n\nAdobe is now looking to partner with OpenAI and add that company’s technology to its software. Time will tell if success is achieved. In the meantime, ADBE stock continues to slide lower.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) is also doing its best to capitalize on the AI craze, recently announcing plans to spend $1 billion expanding its semiconductor packaging and testing plant up north in Canada. During this year’s first quarter, IBM provided its army of 160,000 consultants with AI assistants to help boost their productivity. Yet despite its efforts, the AI rollout can’t mask the many problems at the legacy technology company.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM’s stock recently fell 10% after it announced mixed financial results and announced that it is acquiring cloud software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion in a deal that’s expected to boost its cloud-computing services. Analysts seem skeptical of the deal and didn’t care for IBM’s earnings. While the technology company beat on its Q1 earnings, it missed on revenue. It was IBM’s third revenue miss in the last five quarters. The stock of IBM is down 13% in the past month, lowering its year-to-date gain to only 2%.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIn early April, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) unveiled a new AI microchip called the “Gaudi 3” that the company says can be used to train and deploy big AI models and chatbots. Intel claims that its new AI chip is over twice as power-efficient and one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing H100 microchip that is widely used with AI. Intel said that the new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter of this year, though it didn’t provide a price for the new chip.\n\nTaking share from Nvidia in the AI chip market will be difficult for Intel. Nvidia currently holds an estimated 75% to 80% share of the AI chip market with its graphics processors, known as GPUs, that have become the standard for running AI applications and models. In March of this year, Nvidia revealed new B100 and B200 GPUs, which are the successors to its smash hit H100 chip and are even more powerful. Intel is also struggling with its transformation into a microchip and semiconductor foundry business.\n\nSince the start of April, INTC stock has fallen more than 30%. Over five years, the share price is down 41%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

The company reached the $2 trillion market capitalization following its first quarter earnings beat. On April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced the earnings for the first quarter of 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $1.89, beating consensus by $0.39. The revenue was reported at around $80.54 billion and surpassed estimates by $1.84 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning for the next wave of AI investment. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“It was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.\n\nNow, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths.”\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech giant that is massively expanding in AI services. On April 29, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that it is collaborating with German mass media firm, Axel Springer SE.

Here is what Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO, Satya Nadella, said regarding the partnership extension:\n\n“This new generation of AI is transforming nearly every aspect of work and life, including how people search for and consume content online. Our expanded partnership with Axel Springer brings together their leadership in digital publishing with the full power of the Microsoft Cloud — including our ad solutions — to build innovative AI-driven experiences and create new opportunity for advertisers and users.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 84.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.3%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 0.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Nvidia's Cloud Gaming Evolution: Streamline GeForce Now and Anticipate Xbox Support on Steam Deck\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has introduced a script that streamlines the setup of its GeForce Now cloud gaming service on Valve’s Steam Deck. The script automatically installs Google Chrome, configures the browser for gamepad use, and adds a GeForce Now shortcut to the user’s Steam library.\n\nThough the script handles the SteamOS terminal app for Chrome installation and gamepad support, some manual adjustments are necessary to optimize GeForce Now, the Verge reports.\n\nUpon launching GeForce Now, users must press the Steam menu, navigate to controller settings, and change the Current Button Layout to “Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad,” enabling trackpad control for the mouse inside GeForce Now.\n\nFor Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming overlay, long-press the Steam Deck’s menu button for more straightforward cloud gaming navigation. Nvidia cautions that certain games, like Genshin Impact, require gamepad input in the settings interface, which involves using the trackpad for menu navigation. Now, anticipation builds for a possible Microsoft script that would facilitate Xbox Cloud Gaming setup on the Steam Deck.\n\nNvidia offers manual instructions for both Edge and Chrome browsers. Also this week, Nvidia upgraded its AI chatbot ChatRTX by adding more AI models from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and OpenAI.\n\nAnalysts flagged Nvidia as the “AI Woodstock” backed by the $2 trillion generative AI-driven data center market potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to dominate the $90 billion accelerator market with 75%+ share, further backed by the Blackwell product.\n\nNvidia stock gained 209% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Is Apple Missing Out on the AI Hype?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence buzz across the tech world has increased over the past year. All the big players are competing with each other to grab a piece of this booming market. Nevertheless, one tech giant is seemingly on the limp in this race for dominance, or at least that's the image it wants to portray. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always stepped up the game by boosting innovation and enhancing the user experience. But with AI, the tech giant has been maintaining a discrete profile for a long time.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BTI.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that AI is here to revolutionize the tech landscape, a sort of renaissance if one thinks of it. PwC estimates AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Given these rosy projections, Apple's toned-down approach toward the technology has raised speculations about whether it is missing out on the AI hype or playing its cards in silence to take the market by surprise.\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nDespite recent financial struggles, including a major revenue slump since the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Apple saw a nearly 50% spike last year, though it lagged other tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company had a challenging start to 2024 with shares tumbling amid a series of analyst downgrades and was dethroned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. Some critics have blamed Apple for not having a clear AI strategy unlike its competitors, such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which are aggressively investing in the technology.\n\nWhen it comes to AI (or machine learning, as Apple prefers to say), the company is not new to integrating such features into its devices. It has revolutionized many features using machine learning, including Siri, facial recognition and personalized recommendations. However, in the current landscape, compared to other tech giants, Apple has taken a more cautious approach to introducing and announcing AI features and investments. Apple is making calculated moves in the AI space behind the scenes. The company has acquired several AI start-ups in the past decade and is partnering with universities and research institutions to collaborate on projects.\n\nResearch and development spending is one of the key indicators to measure a company's commitment to introducing new features and advancements into its business strategy, especially for tech companies. Apple's R&D spending was roughly 7% of its revenue for 2022. In comparison, in the same year, Google and Microsoft allocated nearly double for R&D and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) spending was more than four times Apple's. According to the 2023 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard by the European Commission, Apple ranks in fourth place, above Asian rivals Huawei (fifth) and Samsung (XKRX:005930) (seventh). However, the company ranks below Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (first three places). While this spending disparity could be highlighting a difference in priorities, it is easy to overlook Apple's strategy of acquiring resources in other areas to step up innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle-Apple alliance: A double-edged sword\n\nRecent reports suggest Apple could enter an AI partnership with Alphabet's Google. As per Bloomberg, Apple is negotiating with the Google parent company to license its state-of-the-art AI model, Gemini. If the deal goes through, Apple might integrate Gemini's AI features into its upcoming operating systems for devices. The possibility of this partnership raises many questions about the company's long-standing tradition of prioritizing in-house development and tight control over its technology.\n\nGoogle and Apple have been in a strategic partnership for a long while and it has proven to be a profitable one. Currently, Google is the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser, and to secure this position Google is reportedly paying around $18 billion annually to Apple. Therefore, Google's AI model Gemini seems like a natural choice for Apple. However, other than the obvious contradiction of the iPhone maker's privacy-first policy, this deal might raise many other concerns, including legal challenges and reduced quality in the user experience.\n\nCurrently, tech giants are facing scrutiny around the world, especially from the U.S. government and European Union. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its alleged monopoly on the smartphone market and unfair treatment of developers through its App Store system. Partnering with another major tech firm and a rival might fuel the current controversy and could attract more legal scrutiny. Moreover, if Apple begins to rely on Google for AI tools, it could stifle competition and reduce consumer choices in the future for potential AI feature upgrades. Google's AI is a cloud-based system that allows developers to use consumer data to strengthen the LLM to become more efficient, which means the privacy of the user data will not be assured. This means more red flags for Apple.\n\nThe current regulatory scrutiny is already hampering Apple's operations. The potential delay in winning the lawsuit and the restrictions that may be imposed by the government could hinder the company's efforts in the AI field. Additionally, the financial burden of a lawsuit could put a halt on the company's ability to find an internal AI solution. Moreover, a well-defined and transparent data protection framework should be put into practice before entering into a partnership with Google, if at all.\n\nApple's AI master plan\n\nEven though Apple is not vocal about its advancements with AI efforts, several ongoing projects are making progress. News surrounding the company's own AI model has garnered substantial traction. According to sources, Apple has reportedly developed a large language model called Ajax GPT, with a performing capacity exceeding GPT 3.5. Also, it may be working on an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Apple GPT.\n\nApple might have been suspiciously quiet about AI in product launches. However, it has acquired the greatest number of startups among all tech giants since 2017. The company is likely to have spent around $1 billion in acquiring various AI ventures. In 2023 alone, Apple reportedly bought more than 30 AI ventures. These acquisitions take place mostly to cover various specialties such as self-driving technology, voice design, music generation and image recognition, but sometimes to even acquire the talented individuals behind these startups.\n\nThe latest and most important addition to Apple's AI arsenal is DarwinAI. Acquiring DarwinAI can be seen as an investment in technology as well as personnel, particularly specialists in machine learning and AI from the University of Waterloo. A prominent figure in the AI community and former director at the University of Waterloo, Alexander Wang, is currently appointed as a director at Apple, leading the company's AI efforts in Canada. Also, DarwinAI's synthesis model is expected to help Apple's most ambitious AI capability; on-device AI (also referred to as Edge AI) with plans to move forward with generative AI programs in the future.\n\nTwo recent theses published by Apple have shown the company's effectiveness in incorporating advanced levels of AI within the pre-existing ecosystem. One research paper in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne delves into the development of the MM1 generative AI model. The results of the thesis demonstrate Apple's capabilities in developing cutting-edge AI architectures, particularly multimodal learning, which combines images with text data.\n\nAnother paper published showcases the successful execution of large language models in natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks with limited memory. The methods used in the thesis collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a four to 25 times increase in inference speed compared to other approaches in CPU and GPU. Ultimately, this research paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory to deliver exceptionally faster performance.\n\nBoth these research papers and recent acquisitions indicate Apple is on the right track to offering on-device AI capabilities that will far exceed what is currently available in the market.\n\nUsability focus is Apple's product strategy\n\nVoice Assistant, Facial Recognition, Photo optimization, Personalized recommendations, Animoji and Fitness tracking may look like functions that have nothing to do with AI, but all these features are fundamentally built upon various machine learning technologies. Apple was the pioneering tech brand that managed to integrate these features seamlessly into mobile devices successfully. Today, it is working behind the scenes to improve these features by integrating AI.\n\nWhen Siri, the voice assistant, was released, it was received remarkably well across the globe. But soon after the initial product launch, because of Siri's inability to complete slightly advanced tasks, its credibility declined. Following many internal conflicts faced by Apple's Siri team with engineers frustrated by a lack of tools and data to improve it, the chat bot has started lagging behind its competitors. Meanwhile, Google Assistant, with its superior natural language processing and ability to handle complex queries, and Amazon Alexa, with its vast compatible ecosystem, are gaining momentum.\n\nWith the new on-device AI integration, Apple may have reversed the future of Siri and also could enhance the performance of Apple fitness trackers. The Apple Watch already integrates AI features to enhance fitness tracking. For example, the watch uses machine learning to identify workout types and analyze heart rate data, helping to offer more personalized coaching assistance. However, some competitors offer more advanced AI-powered health monitoring features, including blood pressure monitoring.\n\nKeeping up with its brand of prioritizing the user experience more than anything else, Apple has made its first direct AI-related product with the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip highlighting its capabilities for AI tasks. This can be seen as a major breakthrough in Apple's AI strategy, promising its customers not a cloud-based AI service, but an on-device AI experience that upholds user privacy.\n\nApple follows a pattern of announcing new features as they are coming to the market. Therefore, the upcoming Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June may bring potential AI-related announcements. Speculations suggest AI features will be integrated into the new Mac OS as well as iOS 18. The speculations are further strengthened with Apple acknowledging the term AI in its latest quarterly earnings transcript, deviating from its usual terminology. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the introduction of generative AI software in Apple products later in the year.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of AI-integrated hardware such as Edge AI is expected to have a positive impact on the iPhone upgrade cycle. With the current upcycle period standing at a record high of 4.5 years, users upgrading their mobiles for a better AI-powered user experience will boost new hardware sales. This is crucial for Apple amid four straight quarters of sales declines and the dampening sales numbers in China. Analysts such as Dan Ives and Ben Reitzes believe that with AI integration, Apple will experience another supercycle in smartphone upgrades.\n\nApple's AI gamble - Missing out or playing the long game?\n\nApple may not be as aggressively discussing its AI plans compared to other tech giants, but the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. The company's on-device AI integration strategy may prove to be the differentiator in the future. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26, the stock is valued at a premium to the five-year average of 24. This premium may seem unjustifiable at first, but if the company's on-device AI strategy succeeds, a potential iPhone upgrade supercycle will help it book stellar revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Apple is certainly not missing out on AI despite not joining the hype publicly, yet. Contrarian investors may want to build a position in Apple to potentially benefit from a surprise AI announcement in the coming months.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Nvidia (NVDA) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.8% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in NVDA?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $23.94.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "What's in the clouds for Amazon's (AMZN) lucrative AWS business: $100 billion in 2024 sales.\n\n\"This quarter, we just announced a few days ago that AWS did hit the $100 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone — not many tech companies have done that,\" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said on the Opening Bid podcast (video above).\n\nAdded Selipsky, \"I think it's a notable milestone.\"\n\nPowered by voracious demand for generative AI services and the ongoing push to move workloads to the cloud, Amazon's enterprise cloud operation is fresh off a bang-up first quarter.\n\nAWS sales accelerated for the second straight quarter, rising 17% year over year to $25 billion. The business — which Amazon CEO Andy Jassy hired Selipsky to run in 2021 — saw operating profits nearly double to $9.4 billion.\n\nThe division represented about 62% of Amazon's Q1 operating profits. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky delivers a keynote address during AWS re:Invent 2023. (Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) (Noah Berger via Getty Images)\n\nSelipsky contends that with 85% of companies still storing their data on-premise, the tailwinds for AWS are just beginning to gust.\n\n\"We're optimistic about the business outlook for AWS and I think it can continue to grow really rapidly. I don't really see an upper limit on it,\" Selipsky says. \"Of course it's not our birthright, it's not guaranteed. We'll only be as successful as what we do tomorrow for customers.\"\n\nThe avid water skier and wine aficionado says he doesn't wake up each day thinking about crushing rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Rather, he spends his time plotting out how to keep customers happy — part of the \"Day One\" culture etched into the company by founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nWall Street believes Selipsky and his AWS team will continue to be the main drivers of Amazon's profits — and stock price.\n\n\"Drivers [of AWS] are strong and sustainable — the ending of cost optimization cycles, core cloud demand, and Gen AI workloads that are amounting to a multi-billion revenue run rate,\" Evercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney said in a client note following Amazon's earnings.\n\nMahaney continued, \"Key is that this marked the first quarter since the third quarter of 2022 that AWS dollar revenue growth surpassed that of [Microsoft] Azure, which changes the cloud industry leadership narrative.\"\n\nSomething else to watch: The tech trade\n\nThe Magnificent Seven trade — Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — has swung back to life amid strong earnings from the aforementioned Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia. Billionaires Steven Cohen and Israel Englander Are Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared in the triple digits over the past year, thanks to its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The company is the world's leading AI chipmaker, powering the crucial task of training AI models so they can then go on to solve complex problems. This has helped Nvidia's earnings soar and the stock find its spot in the portfolios of many billionaire investors.\n\nBut two billionaires recently cut their positions in Nvidia and, at the same time, placed bets on another AI stock instead. Steven Cohen, chief executive officer of Point72 Asset Management, decreased his holding of Nvidia shares by 66% in the fourth quarter of last year, while Israel Englander, CEO of Millennium Management, lowered his position by 45%.\n\nYou'll find top tech stocks among the biggest positions in these billionaires' funds, so it's clear they're focused on selecting tomorrow's AI winners. For example, two of the most heavily weighted tech stocks in Englander's fund are Microsoft and Alphabet, companies that are pouring investment into AI.\n\nWhat company is Cohen and Englander betting on as a potential AI winner over the long term? It's a player that recently said demand for its AI infrastructure is so strong, it's actually exceeded supply. Let's find out more about this potential AI star that's a favorite of these billionaires right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCohen and Englander agree on this stock\n\nYou'll probably recognize the name of this company, as it's been around for years as a software and database powerhouse. I'm talking about Oracle(NYSE: ORCL). In the fourth quarter, Cohen opened a new position in Oracle, while Englander increased his holdings in the tech giant by 138%.\n\nOracle, founded in the late 1970s, was originally known for its database management system but has since greatly broadened its offerings. It remains smaller than rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing market, but in recent times thanks to AI demand, it's recognized the cloud infrastructure growth opportunity -- and has made that its major focus.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Oracle's cloud infrastructure revenue soared 49% to $1.8 billion. And total cloud revenue -- including software as a service and infrastructure as a service -- represented 38% of overall revenue. The quarter signals a turning point, with the company's total cloud revenue coming in higher than total license support revenue for the first time ever.\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure business is driving growth, and by offering advantages that are winning users over, this could continue. The company notes it's cheaper than competitors, such as Google Cloud, for example. Oracle also sells a variety of cloud options such as a platform that allows users to run their own Oracle Cloud. The company even offers multicloud services, so you can use an Oracle service in another public cloud, like Microsoft's Azure.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand surpassing supply\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, demand for Oracle's AI infrastructure services is surpassing supply -- even as the company is expanding current data centers and opening new ones. Oracle predicts that its Gen2 cloud infrastructure business will continue in a \"hypergrowth phase\" for quite some time. The company today has 47 public cloud regions worldwide and is building eight more. Twelve of these regions connect with Azure, and more are on the way.\n\nOracle is likely to benefit as the capacity increase allows it to address more and more of the growing demand and it integrates its earlier acquisition of digital information systems company, Cerner.\n\nShould you forget Nvidia and turn to Oracle? Billionaires Steven Cohen and Israel Englander still hold a great deal of Nvidia shares, and the company offers solid long-term prospects. Nvidia sells today's top-performing chip, and its research and development resources suggest it could stay ahead as it releases new products -- such as the Blackwell architecture expected later this year. This means Nvidia shares could have plenty of room to run.\n\nBut Oracle, which has gained about 20% over the past year, has some catching up to do when it comes to share performance -- and it may do just that, considering recent earnings trends and long-term prospects. That makes this top tech stock look pretty cheap at just 20x forward earnings estimates -- and offers you the perfect opportunity to turn your attention away from Nvidia for a moment and follow billionaire investors into Oracle.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $508,797!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have seen impressive growth over several years due to the growing need for semiconductors in everyday items. With the burgeoning tech industry, investors have given increased attention to innovative companies in the sector.\n\nAs new technological advancements occur, the need for semiconductors will only grow. It would be wise for investors, especially those who are building a retirement account, to gain exposure to semiconductor stocks due to their high likelihood of compounding returns.\n\nBelow are a few options for semiconductor stocks that haven’t garnered as much attention as the main stocks in the industry, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). However, they provide solid returns and are great additions to a retirement account.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a semiconductor equipment manufacturer that produces single-wafer cleaning products for use on 2D and 3D wafers using both a wet process and electrochemical plating.\n\nOn Feb. 28, ACM Research reported earnings for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, stating that total revenue increased by 57% and net income rose by 50% compared to the previous year. The company mentioned that increased operating margins, new product rollout, and a growing customer base help to improve its overall earnings potential. ACMR also handily beat analysts’ expectations for revenue and earnings per share.\n\nACM Research has released preliminary results for Q1 of 2024, with the full report expected release date being May 8. It stated that revenue year-over-year is projected to grow by 102% to 105%, and total shipments to increase by 163% to 169%.\n\nOver this past year, ACMR has seen its share price increase by 166%, mostly due to its fourth-quarter earnings, which propelled the stock price by over 40% directly following the announcement. With first quarter 2024 results expected to be very strong as well, all eyes should be on ACM Research regarding its growth prospects.\n\nImpinj (PI) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) operates a cloud platform that manufactures integrated circuits for software and algorithmic applications. These circuits are used in industries such as retail, automotive, banking, aviation, and healthcare.\n\nIn March, Impinj received a sigh of relief from investors following the outcome of patent litigation with NXP Semiconductor regarding RFID products. This was a multi-year dispute. Now, all legal proceedings in the matter are terminated.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Apr. 24, Impinj reported earnings for the first quarter of 2024, in which it stated that total revenue decreased by 11% and cash and cash equivalents increased by fourfold year-over-year. A net loss of $4 million was reported for the first quarter of 2023, and for Q1 2024, that increased to a net income of $33 million.\n\nPI also released its financial outlook for the second quarter of 2024, with expected revenue between $96 and $99 million compared to $77 million in the first quarter.\n\nImpinj is one of the solid semiconductor stocks that offers investors potential upside. Its share price surged following the reported first-quarter earnings for 2024, in which its share price nearly increased by 30%. With a strong Q2 projected, this may be a great opportunity to purchase a share of PI.\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI) A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI) offers a range of semiconductor products, including microcontrollers and processors for wireless connectivity, security, and sensor applications.\n\nNXPI reported earnings for Q1 of 2024, stating that total revenue remained practically unchanged and net income increased by 3%.\n\nNXP Semiconductors offers a decent dividend yield. Its annual dividend is 1.58%, and the most recent quarterly dividend distribution was on Apr. 10, for one dollar and one cent per share.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter beat analyst predictions regarding earnings per share. The outlook for the second quarter piqued investors’ interest due to its increased projections of $3. 025 to $3.225 billion in total revenue, with analysts predicting $3.11 billion in sales.\n\nNXP Semiconductor is a large semiconductor company that can provide investors with stable share price appreciation. Its share price has grown by 50% in the last year. It’s a great long-term pick for investors seeking exposure to this rapidly growing industry.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken the tech world by storm over the last year and a half. While OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom, it's Nvidia that's captured most of the spoils thus far.\n\nShares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) superstar have jumped 500% since the start of 2023 as revenue and profits have skyrocketed. Nvidia's products comprise the backbone of AI infrastructure, and demand for them has been so strong that there have been shortages of GPUs.\n\nOn its recent earnings call, Tesla noted that it had installed 35,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs in supercomputers. It was the latest sign that Nvidia's hardware is shorthand for AI prowess, as the more of its components a company has, the more AI training and AI inference it can do.\n\nGiven Nvidia's value in the AI race, it's only natural to wonder who Nvidia's biggest customer is. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's top customers\n\nNvidia doesn't disclose who its biggest customer is. That's not surprising since that information would be valuable to competitors. However, in its recent 10-K filing, the company did say that one customer represented 13% of its revenue from its compute and networking segment, and an indirect customer that purchases Nvidia products through integrators and distributors, including the customer above, represents 19% of the company's revenue. This name is also from the compute and networking segment.\n\nIt's not completely clear who that customer is, but we have a good sense of who Nvidia's biggest customers may be based on media reports and deduction.\n\nUnsurprisingly, big tech companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet are believed to be among Nvidia's biggest customers, making up roughly 40% of its revenue.\n\nIt's also clear that AI start-ups, like OpenAI, and autonomous vehicle companies, like Tesla, are significant customers of Nvidia. At this point, any company investing in AI is almost certainly an Nvidia customer.\n\nNvidia's customer concentration does add some risk, especially if those big tech companies pulled back on spending, but the greater threat may be incoming competition from AMD and Intel. If Nvidia can defend itself from that, the stock should continue to be a winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "5G stocks have an increasingly bad rap, as initial trends (reminiscent of blockchain enthusiasm, then artificial intelligence exuberance) pointed to every 5G company as a millionaire-maker. But, just as we saw with blockchain and are starting to see with AI, only a handful of companies are truly innovative and worth buying for the long-term: the rest are riding the tailcoats of others’ initiatives. But, now that the dust has settled over the wider industry, those top 5G stocks are coming to the surface — at a discount.\n\nRapid advancements drive the surge in innovation within 5G stocks. We use more data than ever, necessitating expanded coverage from terrestrial and space-based telecom providers. Additionally, the rise of edge computing is increasing the demand for ultra-fast data connections, and semiconductor innovations are enhancing our connectivity as the Internet of Things concept continues to evolve.\n\nDespite the market often pricing them as volatile meme stocks, quality 5G stocks are far from speculative. And these 5G stocks are as high-quality as they come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) hits two major “hard tech” investment criteria: the semiconductor company is also a strong 5G and wireless data stock in its own right. This company supplies critical semiconductors across the wireless ecosystem, from cell towers to user phones, with a key role in expanding 5G connectivity globally through its components vital for band switching and other 5G functionalities.\n\nWhile Skyworks benefits from a vast market potential, its heavy reliance on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which constituted more than 65% of its 2023 revenue, introduces risk. Still, the fast-growing and expanding 5G market, projected to grow at 32% annually until 2030, provides a buffer against client concentration risks.\n\nInstitutional investors hold 84% of Skyworks’ shares, underscoring the stock’s smart money backing. Beyond basic passive indexing institutions (Vanguard et al.), Skyworks’ roster includes brand-name hedge and active fund managers. This broad institutional support indicates a strong belief in the unique value of this 5G-meets-semiconductor stock within the niche tech sector.\n\nFabrinet (FN) A concept image of a cellphone tower with numbers surrounding it.\n\nLike Skyworks, Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) stands out among 5G stocks by sitting at the intersection of multiple emerging tech trends, including artificial intelligence. Fabrinet specializes in manufacturing optical cables essential for high-speed data transmission across various hardware platforms, capable of speeds exceeding 800GB per second. These cables are hot topics for 5G data transfer, advancing machine learning and AI technologies. This particular product line contributes $500 million to Fabrinet’s revenue, highlighting its importance to the company’s financial health.\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet is a crucial supplier to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the semiconductor giant, alongside many other big-name 5G and semiconductor companies. While pure-play 5G competitors vie for leadership in the sector, Fabrinet secures its profitability by providing essential components required in the industry, ensuring its success irrespective of which company leads the market.\n\nWith a valuation of just 2.9x sales and 25x earnings, Fabrinet seems undervalued, considering its pivotal role across multiple domains. As the global economic landscape improves and regions continue 5G integration, Fabrinet could be one of the game’s biggest winners.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the stabler side of the spectrum, legacy telecom stock AT&T (NYSE:T) is also emerging as a top 5G stock contender based on its longstanding market penetration and strength, relative stability and dividend and emerging forward-looking 5G initiatives.\n\nOne such growth initiative for AT&T is its sizable stake in and partnership withAST SpaceMobile’s (NASDAQ:ASTS) ambitious project to provide satellite-based cellular services, aiming for a commercial launch in 2024. While this venture may not transform AT&T overnight, it underscores its commitment to exploring new technologies and maintaining competitiveness in a saturated market.\n\nIn its late January earnings report, AT&T disclosed some missed targets but highlighted robust growth areas, such as a nearly 4% increase in wireless service revenue year-over-year. This growth demonstrates AT&T’s ability to navigate economic challenges and expand its customer base through strategic pricing. AT&T added 526,000 postpaid phone subscribers, exceeding the forecasted 487,500, reaffirming its strong market position as national and global customers make the 5G transition.\n\nDespite some views of AT&T as a yield trap, the company maintains a solid 6.7% dividend yield supported by a sustainable 56% payout ratio, continuing to make it an attractive option for dividend-focused investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Top 25 Stocks in the S&amp;P 500 by Index Weight Right Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the flagship stock index and some recent news for its biggest constituents then you can skip ahead to Top 10 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, politics, and the finance industry. This is because it is one of the most widely followed barometer of the economy, with investors and finance professionals using its data to inform their daily decision making. For politicians, a rising index means that they can boast to voters for having managed the economy well. For finance professionals, they can rest easy knowing that the pricey bets that they might have made on the stock market are doing well.\n\nWhen compared to other indexes, the S&P 500, managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), is particularly important because of the stringent conditions that a firm must meet to be included in it. For starters, only sizeable large cap stocks, or those with a market capitalization greater than $18 billion can be included in the index. These large cap stocks must also be highly liquid, generate most of their revenue in America, and of course, be profitable. These criteria remove most firms that might not do well financially, and as a result, the S&P is also recommended as a great passive investment.\n\nShifting to its performance, 2024 has been a fireworks filled year for the S&P 500. The index is up by 6.9% year to date, after it also crossed the illustrious 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history. In fact, year to March 28, 2024 the index had marked 11% in gains, but it ended up losing these after the inflation data for the month led to investors significantly revising their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations for 2024.\n\nIn April, while the index did end up revaluing itself in the wake of shifting rate cut paradigms, the first quarter of 2024 earnings season marked by Wall Street's enduring focus on artificial intelligence seems to have injected some life into it. The season, at least as far as artificial intelligence and technology stocks are concerned, started by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sharing its latest financial performance on April 24th. Meta's results led to tens of billions of dollars in market value being wiped out as investors didn't take too well to $40 billion in AI spending for 2024 at a time when expenses were growing. These were followed by results from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which were more favorably received. If anything, the latest earnings reports have at least stopped the S&P 500 from bleeding further losses, and right now, Wall Street is focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of April.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this meeting is not expected to yield a rate cut, the focus, as always, is on comments made by the Fed after its meetings. These comments help set the tone for future monetary policy actions, and traders will also focus on earnings from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to see whether there's any juice left for more growth. Google parent Alphabet's earnings came with a nice surprise for investors in the form of a dividend, and Wall Street is now focused on whether Amazon will follow suit.\n\nHowever, while the economic picture on the surface might point to fewer Fed interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 might surprise by posting gains if the central bank overshoots market expectations or considers economic weakness more strongly than expected. Just what might force the Fed to swing the other way despite hot inflation and labor costs? Olivia Micklem of Artemis Investment has some insights:\n\nObviously we can see with the data that's been coming through in recent weeks that inflation continues to run hotter than we would have liked to see at this point in the year. That being said, alongside that we are starting to see pockets of weakness in the economy whether that's parts of the consumer economy and other parts of the industrial complex. We got some softer number out of some of the trucking companies last week, for example. So there are indications that some parts of the economy are slowing down. I think we still remain you know cautiously optimistic that there could be an opportunity as we move through the year for the Fed to stay on track with some of their plans to start bringing rates down.\n\nSo, with the S&P 500's future remaining as dynamic as ever, we decided to look at which stocks have been assigned the highest weights by its managers. A few notable ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 5 Reasons Why Millionaires Think They’re Middle Class\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the top S&P 500 stocks by weight, we used the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a proxy and verified the data by the S&P's limited publicly available information about the S&P 500's top ten stocks.\n\nTop 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now\n\n25.

        "title": "Will Nvidia (NVDA) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Nvidia (NVDA), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 16.52%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Nvidia was expected to post earnings of $4.55 per share, but it reported $5.16 per share instead, representing a surprise of 13.41%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.36 per share, while it actually produced $4.02 per share, a surprise of 19.64%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.50%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 22, 2024.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Companies have clearly defined goals: to grow their customer base, brand power, and global influence, compete with giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and join the shortlist of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nWhile this sounds great, reaching a trillion-dollar market cap is a tough mountain to climb. Companies on their way to this peak should offer superior products that their clients love and adapt to the market’s continuously evolving needs.\n\nLike anyone wanting to enjoy a comfortable retirement, I, too, would like to own companies that give me that potential. So, in this article, I’ll shortlist three buy-rated companies that I think have the potential to reach the trillion-dollar milestone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo come up with the list, I screened for the following criteria:\n\nCompanies nearing $1 trillion market cap/valuations Buy-rated stocks Double-digit quarterly or yearly revenue growth year over year (according to the latest reporting period)\n\nI then sorted the results from farthest to closest based on their proximity to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a leader in infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a rich history and a reputation as the global leader it is today. With roots from its predecessor, Ma Bell, Broadcom has made its mark as one of the top “go to” companies for cybersecurity, distributed software, mainframe, data management and networking solutions.\n\nBroadcom has further cemented its foothold in the tech sector with its recent acquisition of VMWare, which helps it virtualize desktop operations systems, modernize its customer’s private and hybrid cloud environments, and reach its goal of becoming the world’s number one infrastructure technology firm. Speaking of modernization, Broadcom also has strong connections to AI with its networking products and AI accelerators for AI data centers that solidify its trajectory for growth.\n\nWith a market cap north of $560 billion, I won’t blame you for saying it’s a tad early to think it will reach the trillion-dollar mark anytime soon.\n\nHowever, Broadcom has a strong portfolio of services that can help it cross the finish line.\n\nIts finances aren’t bad either, with Q1 2024 revenue growing 34%.\n\nAccording to AVGO stock’s strong buy recommendation, analysts also appear optimistic about the company’s prospects as one of the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is one of today’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Its specializes in oncology, neuroscience, immunology and diabetes medications. Eli Lilly’s strong list of products — Humulin, Cymbalta, Adcirca, Yentreve, and the widely popular Mounjaro and Zepbound — propelled it to greater heights.\n\nWith its market cap currently around $712 billion, Eli Lilly is close to reaching the trillion-dollar milestone thanks to its growth products, promising pipeline, and phase 2 trials of tirzepatide in treating NASH.\n\nThe company’s fiscal year 2023 financials also boasted a 20% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong customer reception of its new products. The company also has a promising outlook with GAAP EPS, which is expected to reach $11.80 to $12.30, and revenue of between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion.\n\nCombine this with the strong buy recommendation from Wall Street experts, and we may have a recipe for another trillion-dollar success.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile almost everyone knows its billionaire owner, Warren Buffet, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) may not be as popular with non-investors. Its operations are structured as a holding company for its subsidiaries in various sectors.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s main strategy focuses on holding stakes in leading companies and buying undervalued businesses that can be derived from its proven and effective value investing philosophy. A recent example is its acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in Pilot Travel Centers LLC from Pilot Corporation (OTCMKTS:POGHF), which has complete ownership.\n\nOf the three on our list, Berkshire Hathaway is the closest to reaching the trillion-dollar milestone, with its market cap around $899 billion.\n\nThe company’s upward trajectory is mostly due to its growth. FY 2023 saw an impressive 21% growth in operating earnings. Net earnings reached $96 billion — a great recovery from last year’s $23 billion loss.\n\nNo wonder analysts like those at UBS main Berkshire Hathaway’s buy rating. Its strong management and investment philosophy rooted in Warren Buffet’s value investing principles, which have proven effective for the company, makes it one of the next potential trillion-dollar stocks to make history.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "content": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$26.0b in cash, so it actually has US$16.3b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.1b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$2.04t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nBetter yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 80% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted  1 warning sign for NVIDIA you should be aware of.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "title": "Pinterest and Tesla have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 2, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Pinterest PINS as the Bull of the Day and Tesla TSLA as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nPinterest became a Zacks #1 Rank in early April as analysts started to raise estimates ahead of their quarterly report this week.\r\n\r\nPinterest reported strong first-quarter 2024 results on Tuesday, with the bottom and top lines surpassing their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.\r\n\r\nThe big story is that lots of architecture solutions for advertising and marketing technology are paying off and providing sustained ROI to sellers, such as bottom-of-funnel direct response ads and supporting ad-tech.\r\n\r\nYou can get all the quarterly numbers and growth metrics in this article we published Wednesday. Today I want to focus on the analyst reactions.\n\nMonetizing Pinterest Gets Real\n\nSeveral investment bank analysts were impressed by the quarter and management's ability to turn the levers of growth -- especially capitalizing on key relationships with Google and Amazon.\r\n\r\nRBC Capital found that PINS' strong Q1 performance was driven by the effectiveness of direct links that resulted in increased advertiser spending due to improved return on ad spend.\r\n\r\n\"Direct Links is working, with advertisers spending more as they see better ROAS,\" said the RBC led by Brad Erickson.\r\n\r\n\"From here, we think Direct Links has only just begun enabling PINS's value-capture from higher conversions,\" they said, adding that Amazon and Google are open-ended contributors that have only just started.\r\n\r\nErickson also highlighted upcoming artificial intelligence (AI) measurement tools that could provide tailwinds for several years.\r\n\r\nRBC raised their price target on PINS to $52 from $48 and reiterated their Outperform rating.\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan liked the \"very strong\" results for Q1, and noted \"broad-based upside.\"\r\n\r\n\"In many ways, we see this quarterly report as evidence of management progress across its mix of product initiatives (shoppable content, direct response/bottom-funnel ad budgets and partnerships aiding in wider scaled monetization).\"\r\n\r\nSheridan maintained his Buy rating while raising his price target from $41 to $44 and he added that the company's partnerships with Amazon and Alphabet \"are contributing revenue momentum that should continue to build throughout 2024.\"\r\n\r\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote that Pinterest \"shifted into a higher gear of growth with broad-based strength across users & monetization.\"\r\n\r\nAnmuth reiterated a Neutral rating while raising his price target from $38 to $44.\r\n\r\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt wrote in a note to clients that the PINS results reflected \"broad-based strength stemming from ongoing initiatives to improve monetization as well as healthy MAU (monthly active users) and engagement growth.\"\r\n\r\nDevitt observed that Pinterest has started to benefit from the \"ongoing adoption of lower funnel advertising tools and new ad surfaces, which are driving monetization improvements.\"\r\n\r\nHe maintained a Neutral rating while raising his price target from $38 to $44.\r\n\r\nPiper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion wrote that while users accelerated across all geographies, with total MAUs of 512MM (+12% year-over-year), management referred to an \"aging down\" of the user base and rightly bragged that \"Gen-Z now ~40%+ of the user base and growing fastest.\"\r\n\r\nChampion reaffirmed an Overweight rating while lifting his price target from $48 to $50.\r\n\r\nBottom line on PINS: With 17% topline growth expected this year and next to cross $4 billion, PINS only trades at 6 times forward sales. Since it looks like estimates will continue to rise from here, I'd be a buyer of this stylish social-shopping platform that continues to innovate and attract new, and younger, users and advertisers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nTesla became a Zacks #5 Rank again on April 12 when shares were still trading above $170 and estimates were still dropping ahead of the EV maker's Q1 report on Tuesday 4/23.\r\n\r\nMy colleague Shaun Pruitt described the situation in his April 15 article...\r\n\r\nIn the two months prior, the Zacks EPS Consensus fell over 20% from $3.44 to $2.73.\r\n\r\nAnd next year plunged nearly 24% from $4.61 to $3.52.\r\n\r\nThese downward analyst revisions ahead of the company report cause TSLA shares to drop under $140 on Monday 4/22, the eve of judgment day.\r\n\r\nBut with the news on 4/23 the market seemed to breathe a collective sigh of relief that things were not worse than delivered.\r\n\r\nWhile investors have been debating the company numbers, statements, and plans, here we'll just focus on why TSLA shares will remain in the cellar of the Zacks Rank.\r\n\r\nSince the report, this year's EPS projection has fallen to $2.48, representing a 20% annual drop in profits.\r\n\r\nInvestors knew that Tesla was aggressively cutting the prices of its cars to gain a dominant position in the EV market.\r\n\r\nWhat they might not have counted on was how hard it would be for the top maker to also cut costs.\n\nWhat's Ahead\n\nThe faithful got a welcome surprise this past Monday when it was announced that China was ready to partner with Full-Self Driving (FSD) initiatives.\n\nThis shot TSLA shares back above $190. But it remains to be seen if this is a near-term driver in 2024 of sales and profits.\r\n\r\nAs many debates rage about the best strategic moves for Tesla going forward -- FSD, the charging network, China imperatives -- the stock will likely remain hostage to the sales growth outlook tempered strongly by the profit metrics.\r\n\r\nSince the profit peak in 2022, every quarter that goes by without a stabilization of net income gives investors reason to believe that the EV revolution of mass adoption may be farther away than they once believed.\n\nAdditional content:\n\n3 Solid Crypto Stocks to Bet On After April Halving Event\n\nThe cryptocurrency market didn’t have a memorable April after a solid rally in the first quarter that saw Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high of $73,750.\n\nThe world’s most popular cryptocurrency has since pulled back and was trading around $62,900 on Apr 30. One of the major reasons behind the decline in Bitcoin price was the halving event, which took place last month. The Bitcoin halving event happens once in four years.\n\nHowever, with the April Bitcoin (BTC) halving event now concluded, there is widespread speculation that the reduction in the supply of Bitcoins will result in a scarcity-driven price increase for the digital asset in the upcoming months.\n\nMiners who validate and record transactions receive rewards from the Bitcoin network and transaction fees. Halving reduces the block reward by half, aiming to cap Bitcoin's global circulation at 21 million. Consequently, demand for new Bitcoins increases, driving up prices.\n\nHowever, analysts argue that because halving occurs every four years and is anticipated, its effects are priced in and not disruptive. Miners may sell to boost cash flows, leading to large BTC transfers to exchanges as part of risk management strategies.\n\nThe ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market is temporary. The ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East between Iran and Israel are also weighing on cryptocurrency prices.\n\nGiven that cryptocurrencies are traded round the clock and globally, they exhibit immediate and sometimes more pronounced reactions compared to stocks.\n\nTheir decentralized nature allows for swift responses to geopolitical events, as traders quickly buy or sell digital assets to navigate uncertainty. This agility in the cryptocurrency market enables rapid adjustments to changing circumstances, reflecting the dynamic and interconnected nature of the digital asset ecosystem.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 141.6% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold and cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "The U.S. GDP saw a modest increase of 1.6% in the first quarter. This fell short of the expected 2.4% growth rate leading to a brief period of downturn in the stock market. Amidst this, savvy investors are looking for AI stocks to buy.\n\nDespite the broader market’s volatility, AI companies continue to innovate and set a foundation for long-term growth. As per Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is set to grow at a CAGR of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. The market is forecasted to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. Sectors like healthcare, automotive and financial services will be particularly impacted by AI.\n\nHere are three AI stocks to buy that have significant upside potential. These AI stocks listed below present a valuable chance for investors to capitalize on the growing influence of AI. These firms are not only at the forefront of technological innovation but also present strong growth potential for proactive investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike AI stocks to Buy, Close-up of letters \"AI\" written on a computer chip, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks. ai chip stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/YAKOBCHUK V\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has emerged as a leader in the cybersecurity space.

The company’s growth was primarily driven by new customer acquisitions and deeper penetration within existing accounts. Furthermore, CrowdStrike’s robust free cash flow margin of 31% in FY24 highlights its operational efficiency and profitability potential.\n\nCrowdStrike’s stock is up 23% in 2024. Wall Street analysts are bullish on the company and have an average price target of $394 on the stock. That translates into a 29.6% potential upside in the near term for this option in AI stocks to buy.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Graphic of front profile of artificial face in pinkish-red hue with binary code and symbols surrounding it, symbolizing artificial intelligence and AI stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/local_doctor\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been making waves in the tech industry, particularly within the realms of artificial intelligence and data centers. Supermicro stands out not just for its remarkable growth but also for its strategic positioning in a critical sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nSMCI’s stock price has climbed more than 200% in 2024, a testament to its robust business model and market demand. The company has been at the forefront of addressing the insatiable market demand for data center GPUs, a segment that has seen exponential growth due to the rise of AI technologies. To keep up with this demand, Supermicro announced significant expansions, including two new production facilities slated to enhance the production capabilities by 25%.\n\nFurthermore, Super Micro Computer partnerships with leading tech firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDQ:INTC) further solidify its position in the market. These collaborations allow Supermicro to incorporate the latest semiconductor technologies into its products and stay ahead in delivering top-tier performance for AI and computing tasks.\n\nSentinelOne artificial Intelligence concept\n\nSource: Blue Andy / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) offers cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions powered by artificial intelligence.

For fiscal year 2025, SentinelOne aims to maintain its growth trajectory while achieving positive free cash flow and operating income by year-end. Moreover, during the earnings call, the CEO discussed the strength of SentinelOne’s AI-powered security platform, Singularity and its recognition by Gartner as a leader in endpoint protection.\n\nDespite these impressive top-line results, the company’s share price has struggled to gain traction, reflecting the market’s broader concerns about profitability and cash flow in the tech sector. However, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the company and have an average price target of $29.55 on the stock. That translates into a 37.2% potential upside in the near term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The metaverse may have gotten off to a rough start, but don’t write it off just yet. Instead, you may want to consider buying some of the top metaverse stocks today.\n\nSure, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still losing money on it, but it’s not giving up on it either. In fact, META is now associating its metaverse plans with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n“Fueled by mainstream tech giants’ attempts to make metaverse popular in a Web2 fashion and technological advancements—such as high-speed internet and smartphones becoming tiny supercomputers—metaverse is expected to become a $5 trillion business by 2030,” as noted by CoinTelegraph.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs we wait to see what’s next on the horizon, let’s explore some top metaverse stocks you may want to buy and hold.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nMetaverse stocks like Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) have been beaten up recently, but it’s still a solid buy opportunity.\n\nFirst, the company issued better-than-expected quarterly results, with an even better outlook for the fiscal year. True, it lost 52 cents in the fourth quarter, as bookings climbed 25.3% higher to $1.13 billion year-over-year (YOY). Analysts were looking for a loss of 55 cents on bookings of $1.08 billion.\n\nSecond, RBLX expects its Q1 bookings to come in between $910 million and $940 million. That’s above expectations for $902.6 million. For the full year, it expects bookings to come in between $4.14 billion and $4.28 billion. That’s above expectations for $4.06 billion.\n\n“Roblox said it expects its top line to grow by at least 20% each year through 2027. Roblox also said that it is targeting between 100 and 300 basis points of margin expansion each year as the company moderates spending. The company cited its ability to manage growth in fixed costs, including headcount,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could see even more upside with the AI and metaverse boom. After climbing to a high of $967.66, it’s now back to $830.41. This weakness could be a long-term opportunity. From that last traded price, I’d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay says NVDA is his “top pick” with a price target of $1,100.\n\n“Checks continue to indicate strong demand” for Nvidia’s market-dominating artificial intelligence chips, even as the company increases its ability to supply that demand through (calendar years) 2024 and into 2025,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In the near term, the analyst says fiscal Q1 2025 should see Nvidia produce total revenue of $24.8 billion, of which a staggering $21.3 billion (86%) will come from the datacenter (which at this point means basically the AI chip) division. Assuming this is the right revenue number, it will equal 245% year-over-year growth, and 12% sequential, quarter-over-quarter growth,” as noted by TipRanks.com.\n\nRoundHill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Colorful arrows pointing at the multicolored word \"ETF\" against a cement surface\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/eamesBot\n\nWe can also diversify at a low cost with the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF is the world’s largest metaverse fund and should benefit from two key areas of growth. That includes “The Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,” as noted by RoundHillInvestments.com. “VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.”\n\nSince bottoming out at the start of 2023, the METV ETF ran from a low of about $7 to a high of $12.48. It has since pulled back to $11.87, which signals an opportunity. From its current price, I’d like to see it run back to $17 near term. Even better, the METV ETF is starting to pivot higher from overextensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Chip Stocks on Sale: 3 Semiconductor Plays to Buy the Dip",
        "content": "Chip stocks pulled back following an earnings report by ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), a prominent semiconductor manufacturing equipment developer, which said it expects its bookings to see a significant 61% sequential decrease in the first quarter.\n\nThis downturn surpassed what investors had anticipated, causing concern in the semiconductor market. This slowdown in equipment purchases by foundries, that manufacture chips for companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could indicate a potential downturn in the semiconductor industry, which is what is hurting chip stocks lately.\n\nThe semiconductor sector was further shaken by a global retreat in semiconductor stocks, prompted by profit-taking after TSMC revised its chip market growth forecast downwards. The revision by TSMC, from over 10% to 10% growth for the global logic semiconductor industry, is fueling concerns over the demand for chips used in various technologies including electric vehicles, computers, and smartphones.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the latest pullback, let’s look at three chip stocks investors may want to buy on dips.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) produces DRAM, flash memory, and SSDs, which are essential for everything from smartphones to data centers. This positive performance has made Micron a standout in the broader chip stocks category.\n\nInvestors should use the recent pullback in Micron as an opportunity.\n\nMicron reported an unexpected profit for its second quarter, signaling a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in the memory chip market. It also transitioned to a profit of $793 million. That was a substantial turnaround from the $2.31 billion loss reported in the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company earned 71 cents per share, defying analysts’ expectations of a per-share loss of 41 cents, according to polls by FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share stood at 42 cents, outperforming the consensus forecast of a 25-cent loss.\n\nThe company enjoyed a 58% increase in revenue, reaching $5.82 billion, which surpassed analyst predictions. In addition, Micron’s Chief Executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, attributed this success to the company’s effective execution in terms of pricing, products, and operations.\n\nLooking ahead, the company’s revenue forecast ranges from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, which exceeds the consensus expectations of $6 billion. This optimistic outlook further underscores the company’s recovery trajectory in the competitive memory chip market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) used to be known for creating powerful graphics chips for gaming PCs and workstations. However, the unprecedented demand for high-end AI chips is what propelled the company’s market capitalization to over $2 trillion at one point.\n\nWithin a single year, Nvidia gained a 260% valuation boost, increasing its market cap by $1.6 trillion. That is more than double the combined market cap of Nvidia’s three closest competitors. Their chips accelerate tasks in AI, data science, and self-driving cars.\n\nNvidia shares are already up 77% but were recently trading below highs following a pullback in the chip sector. Still, investors are very likely to continue seeing Nvidia as the clear artificial intelligence (AI) winner as long as the company can maintain its ~90% market share in this market.\n\nThe company’s stock was also boosted when Citi analysts opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the chipmaker. According to the firm, recent supply chain checks showed that Nvidia’s visibility has extended into 1H25, which makes it a long-term core portfolio holding.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), is a big name in high-performance server tech. The company designs and sells servers, storage, and other hardware needed for data centers and powerful computing systems. As part of the broader chip stocks sector, SMCI’s role is crucial for advanced computing needs.\n\nThe company’s stock fell as much as 23% in a single day in April after the maker of servers announced the date of its third-quarter results but didn’t pre-announce results. This disappointed investors as they were hoping SMCI could opt to pre-announcer results amid better-than-expected performance in the first quarter.\n\nNevertheless, the SMCI’s strong fundamental profile remains intact. The selloff is more connected to heightened investor expectations than to the change in the company’s performance. In recent months, SMCI stock has rallied on the back of the generative AI boom. Investors see SMCI well-positioned amid strong demand for its AI-centric server technology.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

While the S&P 500 is the most prominent investment vehicle for growth, many investors want exposure to the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500.\n\nIn order to identify the top ETFs for outperformance, one must focus on factors such as low expense ratios, strong historical performance, and alignment with emerging trends. This can be in areas like clean energy, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. If you’re willing to take on a little more risk, these 3 ETFs might be worthy of taking a closer look.\n\nNow, let’s discover the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500 through 2030!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) AI.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is a leading ETF focusing on the semiconductor sector. It has been on a tear this year as demand for advanced semiconductor chips remains exceptionally strong.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is a premier investment option due to its relatively low expense ratio of 0.35% and focus on the semiconductor industry. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, semiconductors will continue to serve as the backbone of innovation. It will power everything from smartphones to advanced AI applications.\n\nFurthermore, it will also be fueled by trends such as 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and electric vehicles. The ETF’s top 5 largest holdings include industry giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nThey account for approximately 50% of the portfolio’s net assets under management.

The ETF focuses on high-quality companies exhibiting strong fundamentals, stable earnings and robust balance sheets.\n\nThe Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF’s asset allocation strategy is incredibly diverse. It includes a mixture of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap equities across various sectors. However, information technology holds the largest mix accounting for approximately 35% of the ETF’s total weight. By spreading across multiple sectors, the fund can reduce the overall risk to any one company.\n\nAdditionally, its passive management style means lower expense ratios which is currently 0.15%. The ETF’s top 5 largest holdings are Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith exposure to quality small, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks, the cost-effectiveness of this ETF makes it a strong contender for outperformance.\n\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (XMMO) A concept image of a board with stock prices with the word \"momentum\" in the middle. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: iQoncept / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Invesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:XMMO) is a premier investment option for several compelling reasons. Mainly, the ETF’s large exposure to midcap stocks with the potential for significant gains.\n\nMid-cap stocks within the S&P 500 index provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio poised for growth. They often exhibit higher growth potential than their large-cap counterparts. Moreover, they also offer greater stability than small-cap investments, striking a balance that appeals to many investors seeking both growth and stability.\n\nThe ETF has far outperformed the S&P 500 in 2024, rising 22.5% compared to the S&P’s 6.24%. Its expense ratio remains relatively low, at just 0.34%. Additionally, its top five largest holdings account for approximately 16% of the ETFs total weight. If you have a little more tolerance for risk, XMMO is certainly one of the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500 through 2030.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Over the last three decades, Wall Street has entertained no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. Since the advent of the internet changed the long-term growth trajectory for corporate America, investors have been waiting for the next innovation that would alter the business landscape. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) might just be the unicorn the investment world has been waiting for.\n\nRelying on software and systems for tasks that would normally be assigned to humans gives AI utility in almost every sector and industry of the market. Last year, PwC released a report (\"Sizing the Prize\") which estimated that global consumption-side benefits and productivity gains from AI would translate into a $15.7 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.\n\nFigures like this are why we've witnessed the foundation of the AI revolution, semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), gain nearly $1.9 trillion in market cap in 16 months. But make no mistake about it; tougher sledding lies ahead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThough Nvidia has benefited immensely from AI, it could underperform for years to come\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended on January 28), Nvidia recorded $47.5 billion in sales from its Data Center segment, which was a 217% improvement from the prior-year period. The fuel behind this stellar sales improvement is its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become a staple in high-compute data centers. In particular, the H100 is the preferred choice by businesses aiming to train large language models and support generative AI solutions. All of the top cloud-infrastructure service platforms globally are deploying Nvidia's H100s in their AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nExceptionally high demand for Nvidia's scarce AI-GPUs has also led to otherworldly pricing power for the company. Whereas net sales rose 126% for Nvidia in fiscal 2024, its cost of revenue climbed by a far more modest 43%. This gap was almost entirely wedged by Nvidia's superior pricing power on its AI-GPUs.\n\nThese competitive advantages have pushed Nvidia's stock higher by 500% since the start of 2023. However, maintaining these gains could prove difficult, if not impossible, with headwinds mounting.\n\nThe obvious concern is that Nvidia isn't going to be the only fish in the pond. Intel recently unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerated chip, while Advanced Micro Devices is in the process of increasing production of its MI300X GPU. Both of these chips are direct threats to Nvidia's H100 dominance in high-compute data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the bigger worry lies within. Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) -- are purchasing Nvidia's H100 GPUs as well as developing their own AI-accelerated GPUs. It's evident these four industry titans aim to lessen their reliance on Nvidia or replace it entirely in the years to come.\n\nFurthermore, there hasn't been a next-big-thing trend or innovation over the last 30 years that didn't endure an early bubble-popping event. Investors have a propensity to overestimate the adoption, uptake, and importance of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this historical precedent.\n\nAll signs point to Nvidia stock struggling in the years to come and likely underperforming the broad-market indexes.\n\nThankfully, two time-tested businesses have the catalysts necessary to handily outperform Nvidia in the return column over the next three years. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has crushed the S&P 500 over nearly six decades. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\nThe first magnificent stock that shouldn't have any trouble leaving Nvidia in the dust over the next three years has little to do with the AI revolution and everything to do with spotting amazing values hiding in plain sight. I'm talking about conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which has been led by billionaire CEO Warren Buffett since the mid-1960s.\n\nThough past performance is no guarantee of future results, the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as Buffett has come to be known, has nearly doubled up the average annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 since the mid-1960s. On an aggregate basis, Berkshire has outperformed the S&P 500 by close to 4,900,000 percentage points!\n\nBuffett's recipe for success effectively boils down to three key points: cyclical stocks, dividend stocks, and share repurchases.\n\nWith regard to the former, Buffett and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have packed Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio with cyclical businesses -- i.e., companies that ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nWhile Berkshire's brightest minds are well aware that recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they rightly understand that periods of expansion last substantially longer than downturns. With this in mind, they've positioned Berkshire Hathaway's investments and roughly five dozen owned businesses, including insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF, to benefit from long-winded economic expansions.\n\nSecond, the Oracle of Omaha and his team have a penchant for buying shares of companies that pay a regular dividend. Public companies that pay a dividend are usually profitable on a recurring basis and capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks.\n\nMore importantly, dividend stocks have outperformed non payers over the long run. According to a recently updated report from the Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, income stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.17% over the last half-century (1973-2023). By comparison, non-payers generated a more modest annualized return of just 4.27% over the same timeline.\n\nLastly, Warren Buffett is a huge fan of repurchasing his own company's stock. Since the covenants governing buybacks were altered by Berkshire Hathaway's board in July 2018, he's green-lit the purchase of more than $74 billion worth of his company's shares. These buybacks are lifting Berkshire's earnings per share (EPS) and incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of existing shareholders.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe second magnificent stock that can crush Nvidia in the return column over the next three years is one of Nvidia's top customers: Alphabet. Alphabet is the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming site YouTube, cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nMost of Wall Street is buzzing after the cash-rich Alphabet announced its first-ever quarterly dividend ($0.20 per share). Alphabet ended March with a treasure chest that contained $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, so it can certainly afford to pay a dividend without adversely affecting its innovative capacity.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's new dividend isn't the catalyst that'll help it outperform Nvidia through 2027. Rather, it's the company's foundational search engine and rapidly growing cloud segment that'll do the trick.\n\nFor more than a decade, Google has been Alphabet's proverbial money tree. It's practically a monopoly, with a more than 91% share of worldwide internet search in the month of March. In fact, you have to go back more than nine years to find the last time that Google didn't account for at least a 90% share of global internet search. As the clear go-to for businesses wanting to reach consumers with their message(s), Alphabet shouldn't have any trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nBut what's really exciting about Alphabet is the rapid rise of Google Cloud. Cloud-infrastructure service spending is still in its early innings of expansion, and Google Cloud has already grown into the world's No. 3 cloud-infrastructure service platform by aggregate spend (as of September 2023).\n\nMore importantly, cloud margins are considerably more robust than advertising margins, and Google Cloud has been a profitable segment for Alphabet in each of the past five quarters. In short, this segment can meaningfully boost Alphabet's operating cash flow in the years to come.\n\nThe final selling point is that Alphabet is remarkably cheap. Whereas shares of Alphabet can be purchased right now, at a fresh all-time high, for less than 15 times estimated cash flow in 2025 -- a 17% discount to its average multiple-to-cash flow over the trailing-five-year period -- Nvidia is valued at nearly 28 times forecast cash flow in its upcoming year.\n\nThe table is set for Alphabet to handily outperform Nvidia over the coming three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang and his wife Lori recently attended the groundbreaking of a new research facility they helped finance (and which will be named in their honor) at the couple's alma mater, Oregon State University (OSU). In a subsequent discussion with OSU president Jayathi Murthy, Huang said, \"We're at the beginning of a new industrial revolution.\"\n\nHe went on to say that during this period, we're \"manufacturing\" artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOne company has already kicked its production into high gear. If Huang is right, this company stands to benefit from the AI \"revolution.\"\n\nPalantir's boot camps\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has decades of experience with AI, which enabled the company to quickly develop generative AI tools that businesses can actually use. The result was its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which helps businesses develop AI-powered solutions to real-world problems.\n\nTo get to the heart of these issues, Palantir hosts boot camps. These consist of \"immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions [that] allow new and existing customers to build live alongside Palantir engineers, all working toward the common goal of deploying AI in operations.\" This process helps businesses \"go from zero to use case in just one to five days.\" Palantir says there's a \"growing backlog of AIP boot camps due to the overwhelming demand.\"\n\nBack in October, the company set an internal goal of conducting 500 AIP boot camps in 2024. However, demand was so great it blew through 560 boot camps for 465 organizations in just four months, and the backlog for attendance is growing.\n\nThe full impact of these boot camps has yet to appear in Palantir's financial results as it continues to ramp up to meet the unprecedented demand. The company's U.S. commercial revenue, its fastest-growing segment, surged 70% year over year, thanks to AIP. Furthermore, the segment is expected to generate \"at least\" 40% growth this year.\n\nBy some metrics, the valuation might appear steep. However, when measured using the forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in Palantir's accelerating growth -- it sports a multiple of less than 1, suggesting an undervalued stock.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in May",
        "content": "Although some investors may not agree, the recent price pullback in some artificial intelligence (AI) stocks may be the beginning of an opportunity instead of the end. With many of these stocks entering into their own little bear markets, their lofty valuations have fallen to more reasonable levels.\n\nAnd while their stock prices may be falling, these companies continue to create and/or develop advancements that should enable them to better capitalize on AI. Instead of running away, investors might want to consider capitalizing on the falling prices of these stocks.\n\nHere are three AI stocks in particular to take a closer look at this month.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAdmittedly, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is arguably an overhyped investment right now. The stock made massive gains as it quickly emerged as the dominant AI chip company, giving it a valuation that was too expensive to touch. Or is it?\n\nNvidia currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 74. That sounds high until one remembers the triple-digit revenue growth for fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31). That resulted in net income rising 581%! Although that level is not sustainable, Nvidia has a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.1!\n\nMoreover, a forward P/E of 35 confirms that the chip giant has become more of a bargain than many might expect.\n\nIndeed, its chip-industry peers have developed competing AI chips of their own. Thus, investors should not expect it to sustain triple-digit growth. Nonetheless, Nvidia claims at least 80% of the AI chip market. Additionally, as competitors develop AI chips, Nvidia will likely hold on to most of its customers as its recently announced Blackwell platform runs large language models at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption.\n\nUltimately, with investors able to buy this dominance at a lower-than-expected valuation, Nvidia provides an excellent opportunity for investors who did not buy earlier.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nWhile Nvidia is arguably overhyped, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) might be a little too underhyped right now. Falling electric vehicle (EV) sales and the uncertainty of Tesla's upcoming lower-priced cars appeared to have soured investors on the stock. The stock price is down close to 55% from its all-time high set in late 2022.\n\nMoreover, the earnings report for the first quarter of 2024 confirmed troubles in the EV market as deliveries dropped by 9%. That meant that quarterly revenue fell 9% yearly to $21 billion. Furthermore, operating expenses rose 37% during that time, resulting in quarterly-net income falling 55% year over year to $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the stock's P/E ratio of 43 is near record lows. Also, Tesla's plan to release a lower-cost EV in the second half of 2025 reassured investors who saw that as necessary to stoke demand for its AI-supported robotaxi platform, which it claims will be released on August 8.\n\nThe robotaxi is also the product that Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believes will emerge as its largest revenue source, taking the self-driving car stock to $2,000 per share by 2027, according to Ark Invest estimates. This is quite a change, considering EV sales accounted for 82% of revenue in Q1. However, even if the 2027 share price is closer to Ark Invest's bear case of $1,400 per share, investors will likely be glad that they bought in May.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nInvestors widely understand Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the top three cloud companies in the world. Now the company is gaining increased recognition as a leader in AI.\n\nThanks to investor enthusiasm for its AI efforts, Microsoft stock is up nearly 26% over the last year. Additionally, these increases have taken the P/E ratio to 33, which is admittedly on the high end of the range for this stock. Still, The P/E drop may be due to revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31) coming in at $62 billion, 17% higher than year-ago levels. Also, the $22 billion in net income grew by 20%.\n\nAdditionally, AI drives much of that growth as it becomes a full-fledged AI company. Like all major cloud platforms, Azure supports numerous AI functions, including the ability to build one's own AI tools.\n\nIts Bing search engine capitalizes on a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of the ChatGPT platform. Due to that alliance, investors are now questioning Google parent Alphabet's dominance in search.\n\nSuch competitive advantages have made and will continue to make Microsoft a top-level AI company. When also considering the company's $80 billion in liquidity, it should have the technology and financial resources it needs to remain an industry leader.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Writes through with CEO quotes and background)\n\nBy Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang\n\nICHEON, South Korea, May 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix said on Thursday its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI chipsets were sold out for this year and almost sold out for 2025 as businesses aggressively expand artificial intelligence services.\n\nThe Nvidia supplier and the world's second-largest memory chipmaker will begin sending samples of its latest HBM chip, called the 12-layer HBM3E, in May and begin mass producing them in the third quarter.\n\n\"The HBM market is expected to continue to grow as data and (AI) model sizes increase,\" Chief Executive Officer Kwak Noh-Jung told a news conference. \"Annual demand growth is expected to be about 60% in the mid- to long-term.\"\n\nLast month, SK Hynix announced a $3.87 billion plan to build an advanced chip packaging plant in the U.S. state of Indiana with an HBM chip line and a 5.3 trillion won ($3.9 billion) investment in a new DRAM chip factory at home with a focus on HBMs.\n\nKwak said investment in HBM differed from past patterns in the chip industry in that SK Hynix had a greater sense of customer demand because capacity is being increased after consultations with customers.\n\nLast week, SK Hynix said in a post-earnings conference call that there may be a shortage of regular memory chips for smartphones, personal computers and network servers by the year's end if demand for tech devices exceeds expectations.\n\nBy 2028, the portion of chips made for AI, such as HBM and high-capacity DRAM modules, are expected to account for 61% of all memory volume in terms of value from about 5% in 2023, SK Hynix's head of AI infrastructure Justin Kim said.

        "title": "7 Penny Stocks That Could Make You a Fortune (If You Dare)",
        "content": "Penny stocks are on the riskier end of the public equity spectrum. They are characterized by their low volume, affordable pricing, and the rapid pace at which their values can surge or plummet compared to more traditional stocks. But, for well-informed investors, penny stocks offer a chance to secure substantial gains on the cheap.\n\nWhen considering penny stocks, remember to objectively and critically review the company’s operational opportunity and its long-term viability. To avoid falling into a “pump and dump” trap, thoroughly assess the viability of the company’s products and confirm the firm’s potential for sustained growth. These companies, while not all profitable, still have sufficient positive factors informing a bullish outlook and could see shares surging sooner rather than later.\n\nBridger Aerospace (BAER) picture of a forest with mountains in the distance\n\nSource: shutterstock\n\nBridger Aerospace (NASDAQ:BAER), is a relative newcomer to the penny stock scene, having listed in early 2023 and trading nearly 50% below post-SPAC merger completion. Despite this drop, the penny stock is poised for a promising future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBridger Aerospace specializes in aerial firefighting, providing a fleet of aircraft that support rural wilderness firefighting efforts—an expansive and diverse industry. To gauge Bridger’s potential market, consider California’s budget: for the 2022 – 2023 fiscal year, the state dedicated $3.3 billion to firefighting efforts, including aerial suppression. With wildfires becoming a persistent challenge, funding will likely increase from here.\n\nAlthough profits remain modest, Bridger reported record end-of-year revenue and income in its latest financial statement. Additionally, its fleet achieved record utilization levels as more government agencies, both domestic and international, sought Bridger’s services. Despite its small size, Bridger Aerospace stands on solid financial ground with a compelling value proposition in a necessary industry.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: Westrock Coffee (WEST) NUZE Stock. A photo of a cup of coffee and some coffee beans and a towel on a wooden table. Coffee stocks\n\nSource: Evgeny Karandaev/ShutterStock.com\n\nWestrock Coffee (NASDAQ:WEST) is also a fairly new penny stock, having completed its SPAC merger in late 2022. Despite debuting amid optimism, its shares currently trade right around the listing price, but recent moves may indicate an imminent upside.\n\nFirst and most noteworthy, Westrock insiders are snagging as many shares as they can — indicating management feels momentum is set to surge. The company’s co-founder and chairman recently bought more than $400,000 worth of WEST stock, and the company’s insider flows slant heavily to the buy side.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps management sees a turnaround imminent, as evidenced by the company’s recent end-of-year filings. Despite a slight sales slump, the company’s profitability prospects improved considerably and lost “just” $20 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a more sizable $40 million dollar in the previous year’s same period. Coffee is a tough sector to penetrate, but as consumer sentiment rebounds and Westrock finds its footing, this penny stock may see itself reenergize rapidly.\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (YYAI) A hand holding a magnifying glass over pennies. under-$1 stocks to buy. penny stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConnexa Sports Technologies (NASDAQ:YYAI) stands out as a unique penny stock tapping into emerging sports trends. The company leverages its proprietary Slinger Bag to target specific sports like pickleball, which is gaining traction in the U.S., padel, popular in Mexico, and the evergreen favorite, tennis. These niche markets allow Connexa to engage consumers directly with targeted, high-quality advertising campaigns, ensuring the longevity and growth of its products. This approach positions Connexa as a promising growth-oriented penny stock, especially as enthusiasm for outdoor sports picks up in the spring and summer.\n\nIn 2023, short sellers targeted Connexa, driving its share price down by over 70% and necessitating a reverse stock split. However, the tide turned as new strategic investors entered the scene, catapulting the stock’s value by over 275% since January. This surge indicates strong momentum for Connexa’s future prospects, particularly as we enter summer sports season and see greater numbers of consumers readying their gear.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: Clearpoint Neuro (CLPT) Medicine and healthcare concept - team or group of doctors and nurses\n\nSource: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealthcare penny stock ClearPoint Neuro (NASDAQ:CLPT) is struggling this month, falling about 20% since April 1st. Still, the company’s flagship ClearPoint platform aids surgical providers in navigating the brain and related systems to diagnose and treat neurological disorders, meaning its tech has strong potential to expand into existing healthcare networks. At the same time, a string of regulatory approvals could spark a stock surge soon.\n\nThe most significant of these approvals came from the FDA, which greenlit the clinical use of ClearPoint’s SmartFrame OR Stereotactic System. This system enhances the delivery of directed radiation therapy during stereotactic radiosurgery, a non-invasive alternative that targets cancerous areas with radiation to damage cells and shrink tumors without open surgery.\n\nImportantly, this platform can be used in the operating room, moving beyond the previous requirement for an MRI setting. Joe Burnett, President and CEO, emphasized its potential: “More than 95% of all stereotactic neuro-navigation procedures occur in the OR. This product, the first in ClearPoint’s history not to require MRI use during the procedure, allows us to reach more hospitals and support significantly more patients than our legacy products.”\n\nMoreover, ClearPoint also received approval from European Union regulators to distribute its existing products on the continent, thereby broadening its market reach and enhancing its total addressable market.\n\niRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum cleaner robots powerful cleaning system with intelligent sensors to clean Pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and daily dust\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough its per-share price of about $8 might not categorize it as a penny stock, iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) has a market cap under $250 million, smaller than several stocks on our list. Despite its modest size, iRobot is positioned as a potential comeback story of the year. A shift in circumstances could trigger unstoppable momentum for this robotics stock, irrespective of broader market conditions.\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) failed acquisition highlighted the value of iRobot’s extensive patent and intellectual property portfolio. Although robotic vacuum sales have recently slowed, iRobot’s advanced technology remains attractive to potential acquirers and investors. With the robotics sector undergoing a renaissance, iRobot emerges as one of the few household names poised to capture significant attention from both institutional and retail investors as this trend advances.\n\nEven without banking on mergers and acquisitions, iRobot’s future looks promising. The company is actively optimizing its operations to survive in a competitive small-cap market. It recently reported a 26% improvement in per-share earnings, and despite the boost, iRobot’s stock is trading at just 0.27x sales, marking it as a distinctive penny stock value play with substantial growth potential.\n\nPenny Stocks to Buy: indie Semiconductor (INDI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOver the past year, semiconductor stocks have surged, but giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) face massive overvaluation as demand remains high. As a result, investors are shifting their focus to penny stock semiconductor companies in search of the “next big thing.” indie Semiconductor (NASDAQ:INDI) stands out in this segment, primarily focusing on semiconductors for automotive and self-driving car applications—a sector seeing increased demand due to rising new car sales and consumer desires for advanced features like driver assistance and sophisticated infotainment systems.\n\nIn 2023, indie Semiconductor achieved a record revenue of $223.2 million, marking a surge of over 100%. Moreover, the company’s profit margins impressively reached 52.5%, showing an improvement of more than 2.5% from the previous year. This expansion in margins demonstrates that indie Semiconductor is not only adapting to changing economic conditions but is also excelling by enhancing efficiencies and reducing costs without compromising on quality.\n\nLithium Americas (LAAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAAC) is among the penny stocks making notable moves this year, even amid a sluggish lithium market. However, trends could pivot in 2024, potentially propelling this Argentinian-focused mining stock upward. The demand for lithium, largely fueled by battery innovation and renewable energy shifts, is expected to increase by over 30% annually through 2030.\n\nLike its industry peers, Lithium Americas faced challenges in 2023 with slow demand and significant oversupply, leading to depressed spot prices. However, demand is picking up speed, and some analysts are forecasting an upcoming undersupply, which could push spot prices higher, favoring Lithium Americas.\n\nEnhancing this outlook, Argentina’s new president, Javier Milei, is boosting optimism around the lithium-rich region’s mining prospects. He aims to ease operational barriers for mining and has even discussed this potential with Elon Musk, considering lithium’s crucial role in electric vehicle production.\n\nTrading below its book value and at a reduced price-to-forward earnings ratio compared to recent years, Lithium Americas presents itself as a compelling commodity penny stock poised for significant gains as market and economic forces realign.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today",
        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.9% in the afternoon session after peer, AMD, reported reported first quarter results which highlighted a material increase in its inventory levels. In addition, AMD's guidance for the next quarter was underwhelming as revenue projection was mostly in line with Wall Street's projections.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, another beneficiary of the current AI wave, reported underwhelming earnings as revenue fell below Wall Street's expectations, with the company calling out supply chain challenges. Like AMD, Super Micro provides data center infrastructure (servers, GPUs, and storage solutions) that power AI models. These include customized cooling racks that enable AI models to deliver better performance.\n\nOverall, the underwhelming results and mixed outlook provided by these semiconductor players suggest the era of hypergrowth that has propelled the valuation of some of the leading innovators in the AI space might be cooling off as investors become increasingly cautious.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 11 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 6.2% as markets rallied, with the Nasdaq up 2.1%, while the S&P rose 1.1%, following strong earnings from big tech companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Notably, the earnings highlighted the strong demand for AI solutions, including cutting-edge AI chips that power most AI applications. These chips are developed by Nvidia and its peers.\n\nFor example, during its Q1'2024 earnings call, Meta raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure. It also released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor.\n\nAlso, during its earnings, Microsoft noted that its operating cash flow was impacted by higher capital expenditures to support cloud and AI offerings, and guided for \"capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments.\" Lastly, Alphabet struck a similar tone, adding during its earnings, \"You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in cloud help us push the frontiers of AI models.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the future looks promising for Nvidia as it continues to meet growing market demand within the AI space.\n\nNvidia is up 72.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $829.38 per share it is still trading 12.7% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $18,394.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Buy on the Dip: April 2024",
        "content": "Many of yesterday’s meme stocks to buy, once the darlings of speculative traders, now languish as forgotten relics at the bottom of portfolios, their potential for massive gains long since diminished. This popular sentiment — “It’s only a loss if you sell” — might not hold much comfort anymore.\n\nProving the truism less-than-true, many former top meme stocks like WeWork, Smile Direct Club and Bed Bath & Beyond have been delisted. A few holdouts remain, barely maintaining their status by hovering in penny stock territory and clinging to a shred of credibility.\n\nHowever, not all is lost. Despite the Federal Reserve’s economic tightening over the past few years, some meme stocks are hovering on the edge of rebounding rapidly based on sector-specific tailwinds. That’s further spurred by whispers of “imminent” rate cuts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRegardless, banking on such uncertain prospects — given the Fed’s “higher for longer” stance — is risky and complex. Instead, if you’re scouting for meme stocks to buy, prioritize those with a clear, viable path to profitability or at least robust fundamentals.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration Tilray (TLRY) logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s finally some momentum among cannabis stocks as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officially pivots its position toward rescheduling with plans to relabel the drug as Schedule III. Pot stocks surged, but among the crop, Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is the best (former?) meme stock to buy on the news. Shares popped nearly 40% on the news, though; since it’s priced within penny stock territory at less than $2.50 per share, there’s plenty of room to run.\n\nBeyond the obvious bud-based benefits, Tilray’s unique position as the country’s 5th largest craft brewer further underscores its potential as a standalone stock, let alone its place on a list of meme stocks to buy. Tilray’s portfolio of craft breweries — and all of the production, marketing and distribution networks it entails — sets the company apart from its many undifferentiated competitors across two domains.\n\nFirst, selling popular craft beers helps Tilray diversify revenue streams in the low-margin cannabis industry without spreading itself too thin or over-diversifying. Second, those distribution networks will be useful once cannabis legalization becomes more widespread. Management is already market-testing THC-infused drinks throughout Canada, so when full legalization spreads, the company will be able to rapidly deploy products nationally.\n\nBit Digital (BTBT) Bit Digital (BTBT stock): several rows of processors in a crypto mining farm.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices are trending downward, don’t let that dissuade you from adding Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) to your list of meme stocks to buy. Like Tilray, Bit Digital is rapidly realigning some operational efforts to pivot away from pure-play crypto mining as the endeavor becomes increasingly costly and margins compress.\n\nBit Digital operates tens of thousands of mining units and has mined over 6,600 bitcoins, valued at over $430 million today. Of course, this figure pales compared to mega-miners like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), which mined a similar amount in 2023 alone. To bridge this gap, Bit Digital is diversifying its revenue streams by venturing into AI-centric infrastructure.\n\nUnder the banner of Bit Digital AI, the company is launching a new business line dedicated to providing specialized infrastructure to support generative artificial intelligence systems and processes on behalf of third-party clients. Essentially, Bit Digital is setting up an array of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) units within a high-end data center. This setup aims to provide smaller companies access to substantial artificial intelligence capabilities via multiple computing power access points.\n\nThis strategy indicates a potential future for digital crypto mining across the sector. With increasing regulations and rising costs, companies may leverage their extensive computing resources to address adjacent challenges. Bit Digital may be a meme stock, but it is also at the forefront of multiple emerging technologies and trends.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt this point, I hesitate even to call Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) a meme stock, considering its profitability streak and apparently sales momentum. Still, shares of the ascendant meme stock have dipped recently alongside the wider market, though there isn’t a clear catalyst for the decline. The drop may stem from a cooling of sentiment following a strong earnings report that previously boosted the stock. This decrease doesn’t represent a significant downturn. Still, it has brought the stock to a level that might be a good buy before it potentially rises again following next week’s earnings report.\n\nHistorically, Palantir’s stock price has fluctuated within a narrow range before experiencing a surge, eventually stabilizing at a new, higher baseline. For a considerable time, this baseline was around $15, but after impressive earnings, it shot to $25 and now seems to be settling at about $20 – $22. If the upcoming May 6th earnings report aligns with previous patterns, this current dip might be an optimal time to invest in Palantir at a lower price, meme stock or not.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

It also maintains backups across its server farms in regions including Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nThe move is part of Alibaba’s strategy to ensure better security and control over its data and potentially reduce costs and liability issues associated with multi-company data management.\n\nCompanies including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) have reached out to Vietnam to diversify their supply chain base amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and China.\n\nLam Research weighed the supply chain shift to Vietnam, with the Vietnamese government canvassing the former to commit $1 billion to local production efforts.\n\nApple suppliers in Vietnam increased by 40% to 35 in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia tapped Vietnamese tech firms for AI development.\n\nAlibaba stock lost over 11% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley.\n\nIf there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own.\n\nThe close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year.\n\nOne of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front.\n\nDelving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines.\n\nAs for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings:\n\nWe’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top technology companies in Silicon Valley. A couple of notable names are Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

        "title": "Stock Market Crash Alert: 3 Must-Buy Semiconductor Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "Expectations are high when it comes to semiconductor stocks. Maybe too high. Several leading microchip and semiconductor stocks have taken big hits recently after they posted first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations but still managed to disappoint investors who have come to anticipate meteoric growth from the sector. Fueled by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, semiconductor stocks have been red hot over the last 18 months. Now it seems that a cooldown period is taking place. This makes it a great time to go after these must-buy semiconductor stocks.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) declined nearly 10% in April after running up 75% during 2023. Much of the growth has been led by semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) which currently produces about three-quarters of the world’s AI chips. Other names also joined the rally and rose at lightning fast speed over the past year. The decline seems to be more about investor expectations than any serious problems at the semiconductor companies. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip.\n\nHere is stock market crash alert: three must-buy semiconductor stocks when prices plunge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the day of this writing, the stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is down as much as 18% after the company delivered financial results that did not live-up to very high expectations. In fact, SMCI stock is falling largely because the company missed its revenue target, announcing sales of $3.85 billion when Wall Street was looking for $3.95 billion. However, despite the miss, Super Micro Computer’s revenue was up 200% in Q1 from a year earlier.\n\nFor all of this year, the company is forecasting revenue growth of nearly 600%. Yet the huge growth doesn’t seem to be enough to satisfy investors who had sent SMCI stock up more than 700% in the last 12 months. The maker of high-efficiency servers that run AI chips and semiconductors did beat profit forecasts, announcing earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 compared to $5.78 that was expected among analysts. The post-earnings selloff seems like an overreaction and presents a buying opportunity.\n\nThis is especially true as the growth story related to Super Micro Computer remains intact. Even with the current pullback, SMCI stock is still up more than 150% year to date.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also an opportunity with semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) after its stock fell 10% immediately following a Q1 print that left analysts and investors wanting more. AMD’s earnings and revenue beat forecasts and the company raised its guidance for AI microchip sales this year to $4 billion from $3.5 billion previously. However, the results weren’t enough for Wall Street and the stock is down double digits.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should pounce on the opportunity to buy AMD stock amid the selloff. Like Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices’ long-term growth story remains solid. As part of its Q1 results, AMD said that revenue at its Data Center unit grew 80% year over year to $2.3 billion due to strong sales of its latest MI300 series AI microchips. The company has sold more than $1 billion of the AI chips since they launched late in 2023. On an earnings call, management said the company is now working on new, more powerful AI chips.\n\nAMD stock is up 400% over the last five years, including a 60% gain in the last 12 months.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has been on an upswing. Since bottoming last Halloween, the legacy semiconductor company’s stock has risen 25%. It’s a big reversal for TXN stock, which has long been a laggard among chipmakers. Texas Instruments got a further boost after the company issued better-than-expected financial results for this year’s first quarter, sending its share price up 7% in a day. Texas Instruments reported earnings per share $1.20, which topped Wall Street forecasts of $1.07.\n\nRevenue during the first three months of the year totaled $3.66 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $3.60 billion. Looking forward, Texas Instruments said it expects Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The company’s Q2 guidance aligned with Wall Street forecasts. Texas Instruments mostly makes chips and semiconductors for use in the automotive sector and industrial applications, areas that are starting to gain traction. Investors should look for a pullback and buy TXN stock. If you are looking for must-buy semiconductor stocks, start here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Nearly 50% of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's Portfolio Is Invested in These 4 Stocks",
        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller is often known for working closely with George Soros to \"break the bank of England\" when they shorted the pound and crashed it in 1992.\n\nHowever, Druckenmiller is a highly accomplished investor in his own right, and his Duquesne Capital Management fund is one of the best-performing funds in history. It grew from $1 million in 1981 to $23 billion by the time he closed it in 2010, generating an average annual return around 30%.\n\nToday, Druckenmiiller runs a family fund, Duquesne Family Office, and you can still track his moves through quarterly 13-F filings with the SEC. It might surprise you to learn that his portfolio is highly concentrated with his top four stocks making up close to half of his holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was Duquesne's biggest holding as of the end of the fourth quarter, making up 12.2% of the firm's portfolio at $408.4 million, or 1,086,120 shares.\n\nDuquesne added 68,860 shares of Microsoft in the fourth quarter, reinforcing his high conviction stance on the tech giant, and the value of that stake, assuming he's held it, has grown further this year.\n\nDruckenmiller hasn't commented on why he owns Microsoft, but there are many good reason to own the stock. Microsoft looks like a no-brainer pick to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, its diversification across multiple business areas, and its leading position in enterprise software.\n\n2. Coupang\n\nDruckenmiller's second-biggest holding might surprise you. It's Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), the South Korean e-commerce giant that resembles Amazon in a number of ways.\n\nThe firm finished the year with Coupang making up roughly 11% of the portfolio, or a $371 million position. Druckenmiller was bullish on Coupang in the fourth quarter, buying more than 2 million shares of the e-commerce company.\n\nCoupang is an intriguing opportunity as it has a lot of room for growth as it expands to new markets and adds new product lines. The stock also looks well-priced for its growth potential, and Coupang is leveraging AI to automate its warehouses.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nDruckenmiller originally bet on the AI gold rush by going long on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the fourth quarter of 2022. But he began to taper that bet in the fourth quarter, selling 257,162 shares of the AI chip leader. Nonetheless, the company remained Duquesne's third-largest holding at the end of 2023.\n\nThe 617,494-share position represented 9.1% of the total portfolio. Druckenmuller also held call options for nearly 500,000 shares of the stock, giving his firm additional upside exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has become a popular bet among both professional and retail investors. The business has exploded over the past year as the stock most closely associated with the generative AI revolution.\n\nDruckenmiller seemed to believe Nvidia's rally had gone far enough, though selling the stock in Q4 has proved to be shortsighted as shares are up about 75% this year.\n\n4. Eli Lilly\n\nFinally, Druckenmiller's fourth-largest holding doesn't hail from the tech sector, but Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) is one of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.\n\nHis firm held $235 million of shares at the end of last year, though he did sell down about 11% of his position during the fourth quarter.\n\nEli Lilly's Mounjaro weight-loss drug has been a driver of the stock's surge over the past year. It's now the company's top-selling drug with $1.8 billion of revenue last quarter.\n\nManagement and analysts have big expectations for Mounjaro. If the weight-loss drug continues to follow its current trajectory, the stock should only gain from here.\n\nShould you follow Druckenmiller's lead?\n\nFollowing an investor without doing your own research, even a world-renowned one, is a bad idea. An ultra-wealthy family fund like Duquesne has resources and strategies at its disposal that aren't available to individual investors.\n\nThat said, its top holdings can still shine a light on interesting companies. And in this case, Druckenmiller reminds us that even mature, established tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft can deliver market-beating returns thanks to their ability to capitalize on secular tailwinds like AI.\n\nThe Duquesne Family Office's next 13-F (for Q1 2024) comes out in mid-May.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 30, 2024\n\nJeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

With us today, Charles Liang, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Weigand, CFO; and Michael Staiger, Vice President of Corporate Development. (Operator Instructions)\r\nThank you.\n\nMichael Thomas Staiger\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for attending Supermicro's call to discuss financial results for the third quarter, which ended March 31, 2024. With me today are Charles Liang, Founder and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Weigand, Chief Financial Officer. By now, you should have received a copy of the news release from the company that was distributed at the close of regular trading and is available on the company's website. \r\nAs a reminder, during today's call, the company will refer to a presentation that is available to participants in the Investor Relations section of the company's website under the investor -- excuse me, under the Events and Presentations tab. We have published management's scripted commentary on our website. \r\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 and the full fiscal year 2024. There are a number of risk factors that could cause Super Micro's future results to differ materially from our expectations.\r\nYou can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our most recent 10-K filing for fiscal '23 and our other SEC filings. All these documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Super Micro's website. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. \r\nMost of today's presentation will refer to non-GAAP financial results and business outlook. For an explanation of our non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the accompanying presentation or to our press release published earlier today. In addition, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is contained in today's press release and in the supplemental information attached to today's presentation. At the end of today's prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session for sell-side analysts to ask questions. \r\nI'll now turn the call over to Charles.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles Liang\n\nThank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved another record-breaking quarter with revenues of $3.85 billion, a 200% increase from same time last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.65, up 308% year-on-year. Supermicro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. These strong results reflect the continued demand for our rack-scale plug and play total ai solutions. \r\nWe continue to face some supply chain challenges due to newer products that require new key components, especially, specifically, DLC related components, and believe this situation will gradually improve in the coming quarters. To sustain this rapid growth, we are making significant investments in production, operations, management software, cloud features and customer service to further increase our customer base and bring more value to them.\r\nTo support this scale-up, we'd raised an additional $3.28 billion through a convertible note and secondary equity offering in the quarter. We like to support strong short and long-term growth with minimal equity dilution. Overall, I remain optimistic that AI growth will continue for many quarters, if not many years to come. \r\nWe have long recognized that AI is accelerating the need for liquid cooling, and we have invested heavily into high quality, optimized direct liquid cooling, DLC solutions for high-end CSPs and NCPs. With GPUs reaching 700 watts and soon more than 1000 watts, efficiently managing the heat from these AI systems has become critical for many customers, especially at the new datacenters. \r\nI am pleased to announce that our new DLC, direct liquid cooling building blocks and rack scale total solution technology are finally floor-ready grade for high volume production. With our DLC, liquid cooling technology, customers can reduce their expense on cooling expense, saving data center space, and allocate a greater portion of their finite power resources to computing instead of cooling, which aligns with our green computing DNA-ware. \r\nNow let's go over some key financial highlights. Supermicro is pleased to be included in the prestigious S&P 500 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q3 net revenue totaled $3.85 billion, up 200% year-on-year, within our aggressive original guidance of March quarter. If not limited by some key component shortages, we could have delivered more. \r\nFiscal Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $6.65 per share were well above $1.63 last year, which was about 308% year-on-year growth. Our increasing economies of scale contributed to better net profit. Our year-over-year operating margin and net income both continue to improve, and we continue to expect further benefits as we bring our Malaysia facility online later this calendar year.\r\nThis fast-growing quarter was driven by end users wanting to accelerate their deployment of the latest generation AI platforms. Through our Building Block Solutions, we provide optimized AI solutions at scale, offering a time-to-market advantage and shorter lead time over our competition. Additionally, our rack-scale plug and play total solutions, especially with liquid cooling DLC, ensure optimal system performance while saving energy cost up to 40% at a data center scale, delivering much more value to customers. \r\nWe are leading the AI revolution by deploying NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to our customers, housed in our new 100K watt racks, with 2 to 3x higher power density than traditional racks from others. At NVIDIA GTC last month, we unveiled our next-gen Blackwell products, including the GB200 NVL72 solution. To further grow our AI portfolio, we are now strongly focused on delivering new generative AI and inferencing optimized systems based on the upcoming next generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs as well as Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3 and AMD MI300X and MI300A GPUs. \r\nMost of them support both air cooling and DLC cooling. As Supermicro is transitioning to our next generation of X14/H14 product lines featuring the industry's broadest SKUs of Intel Xeon 6 processor-based and AMD Turin-based platforms, we are fully ready for high volume production and offer early online access for testing and validation through our JumpStart cloud service. \r\nMeanwhile, our X14 and H14 storage solutions are addressing the specific requirements of accelerated AI data pipelines with partners like Weka and VAST Data and many others. The rapid growth of our business is raising the complexity to scale our capacity. Our production teams are making aggressive progress on retrofitting the new Silicon Valley facilities and scaling up our Taiwan and Malaysia factories. We have secured the parts and acquired additional warehouses for our next phase of enterprise and data center businesses. \r\nWe are currently on track to produce over 2,000 liquid cooling DLC racks per month of AI servers with volumes steadily increasing. Each DLC rack supports up to 100k watt or even 120k watt. At this moment, we are focusing on delivering more than 1,000 racks of NVIDIA HGX AI supercomputers. Each rack supports 64 pieces H100, H200 or B200 GPUs with the latest DLC, liquid cooling technology to 3 industry-leading customers, from April to June of this quarter. \r\nThese 3 deployments will be among the world's largest DLC liquid-cooled AI clouds, potentially saving our customers up to 40% of energy costs compared to standard air-cooled deployments by our competition. Special thank you to NVIDIA and our close technology partners for this fantastic collaboration. I believe this is just the beginning of our long-term high-volume DLC liquid cooling mission. Green Computing can be free with a big bonus. Let's go for green.\r\nIn summary, we had a strong quarter with more to come. Supermicro is uniquely capable of delivering new technologies to market faster with our integrated rack-scale plug and play solutions, in-house engineering, building block architecture, and green computing DNA. With a robust pipeline of new products in calendar year 2024, we're confident fiscal Q4 revenue will be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion. This will raise our fiscal revenue guidance to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, an increase to our recent fiscal 2024 guide. \r\nWe continue to win market share and remain committed to executing our growth plans across all verticals. This remains truly the most exciting time yet for Supermicro, and I believe this strong year-over-year growth will continue in our fiscal 2025, especially with our new, leading and ready-to-ship DLC liquid cooling rack scale plug and play solutions and technologies. \r\nBefore passing the call to David Weigand, our Chief Financial Officer, I want to thank you again, to our partners, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders for their strong support. David.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nThank you, Charles. Fiscal Q3 2024 revenues were $3.85 billion, up 200% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 growth was again led by AI GPU platforms, which represented more than 50% of revenues with AI GPU customers in both the enterprise and cloud service provider markets. We expect strong growth in Q4 as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins.\r\nDuring Q3, we recorded $1.88 billion in the enterprise channel vertical, representing 49% of revenues versus 40% last quarter, up 190% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, driven by industry recognition of our solution price performance metrics and reliability. The OEM appliance and large data center vertical revenues were $1.94 billion, representing 50% of Q3 revenues versus 59% in the last quarter, up 222% year-over-year and down 10% quarter-over-quarter. \r\nOne existing CSP large data center customer represented 21% of Q3 revenues and one existing enterprise channel customer represented 17% of revenues. Emerging 5G telco/Edge/IoT revenues were $37 million or 1% of Q3 revenues. Server and storage systems comprised 96% of Q3 revenue and subsystems and accessories represented 4%. ASPs increased on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. \r\nBy geography, U.S. represented 70% of Q3 revenues; Asia, 20%; Europe, 7%; and Rest of World, 3%. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 242%; Asia increased 257%; Europe increased 30%; and the Rest of the World increased 87%. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. revenues increased 3%; Asia increased 17%; Europe increased 3%; and the Rest of the World decreased 11%. \r\nThe Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 15.6%, up slightly quarter-over-quarter from 15.5%, as we continue to focus on winning strategic new designs, gaining market share and improving manufacturing efficiencies. Q3 operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased by 14% quarter-over-quarter and 72% year-over-year to $219 million, driven by higher compensation expenses and head count. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 8% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-over-year to $166 million.\r\nQ3 non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, which was in line with Q2 levels. Other income and expense for Q3 was $3.8 million, consisting of $6 million in interest expense and a gain of $10 million, principally from foreign exchange. Interest expenses decreased sequentially as we paid down short-term bank credit facilities.\r\nThe GAAP tax rate was negative 5.2%, resulting in a tax benefit of $20 million for Q3. The non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 6%, resulting in Q3 tax expense of $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were lower due to the impact of higher R&D tax credits and tax benefits from employee stock grants exercised. Q3 GAAP EPS -- diluted EPS of $6.56 and Q3 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.65 exceeded the high end of guidance through record revenues, stable gross margins and operating margins and lower tax rates. \r\nThe GAAP share count increased from 58.1 million to 61.4 million and the non-GAAP share count increased sequentially from 59 million to 62 million shares as a result of the 2 stock offerings and, to a lesser extent, the convertible bond offering. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $1.5 billion compared to cash flow usage of $595 million during the previous quarter, as we grew inventory and accounts receivable for higher levels of business. Cash flows from strong profitability was offset by higher inventory, a large portion of which was received late in Q3 and higher accounts receivable from increasing revenues. \r\nOur Q3 closing inventory was $4.1 billion, which increased by 67% quarter-over-quarter from $2.5 billion in Q2 due to the purchase of key components. CapEx was $93 million for Q3, resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.6 billion for the quarter. During the quarter, we raised $1.55 billion from a 0 coupon 5-year convertible bond offering due in 2029, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses. \r\nWe also raised approximately $1.73 billion in net proceeds from the sale of 2 million shares at a price of $875 per share. The proceeds from these transactions will be used to strengthen our working capital, enable continued investments in R&D and expand global capacity to fulfill strong demand for our leading platforms. The closing balance sheet position was $2.1 billion, while bank and convertible note debt was $1.9 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $252 million versus a net cash position of $350 million last quarter. \r\nTurning to the balance sheet and working capital metrics compared to last quarter. The Q3 conversion cycle was 96 days versus 61 days in Q2. Days of inventory increased by 25 days to 92 days compared to the prior quarter of 67 days due to key component purchases for higher expected Q4 revenues. Days sales outstanding increased by 8 days quarter-over-quarter to 37 days, while days payables outstanding decreased by 2 days to 33 days.\r\nNow turning to the outlook for Q4. We expect strong growth as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we expect net sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.20 to $8.05 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $7.62 to $8.42. We expect gross margins to be down sequentially as we focus on driving strategic market share gains. \r\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $226 million and include $55 million in stock-based compensation expenses that are not included in non-GAAP operating expenses. The outlook for Q4 of fiscal year 2024 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $30 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses, net of tax effects of $28 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. \r\nWe expect other income and expenses, including interest expense to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The company's projections for Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of minus 2.9%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 2.6% and a fully diluted share count of 64.8 million for GAAP and 65.3 million shares for non-GAAP.\r\nWe expect CapEx for Q4 to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. For fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, we are raising our guidance for revenues from a range of $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion to a range of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and establishing guidance for GAAP net income per diluted share of $21.61 to $22.46 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $23.29 to $24.09. \r\nOur projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 3.6% and 9.2%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 61.2 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 61.8 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for fiscal year 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $116 million in expected stock-based compensation net of related tax effects of $98 million that are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share. \r\nWe're now ready for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\n\nRuplu Bhattacharya\n\nCongrats on the strong guidance. I have 2 questions. First, I wanted to ask a question on liquid cooling. Do you design most of the components for liquid cooling racks in-house? And as such, do you think you would be able to charge more for liquid-cooled racks? And can this be accretive to gross margins?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes, a very good question. Yes, we design lots of key components for DLC liquid cooling system because we care quality, maintenance and also time to market. So we design a lot of key components where we leverage third-party components as well, so it's a combination. And yes, I mean, liquid cooling, we try to charge the customer with minimal premium and customers can save kind of air condition, equipment cost because cooled down by liquid, right?\r\nSo at the same time, customer will save lots of TCO, up to 40% of energy costs. That's why we try to promote a slogan, green computing can be free. We speak bonus. Customers pay a very minimal premium, but they save up to 40% of energy costs. So I believe a lot of customers will go for that direction. And indeed, we already have a handful of customers have a big order, and that's why this quarter alone -- I mean June quarter, we are preparing more than 1,000 liquid cooling racks for those early birds. And I believe that demand will continue growing very strong.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) The next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nI guess in the press release, Charles, you mentioned the visibility into share gains as the new solutions ramp. And I was curious if you can sort of give us a bit more color there in terms of when you're thinking about share gains, are these related to next-generation GB200 product with NVIDIA? And is this more in relation to sort of hyperscalers? Are you expanding the number of hyperscalers that you're engaged with as you move to these new solutions? Just any more color in terms of the visibility around the share gains. Where is that coming from? And is that more in relation to the next product generation from NVIDIA?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nOkay. Thank you. I mean, yes, we continue to gain market share, especially our rack-scale plug and play solution that reduce customers' lead time and also reduce customers' time-to-online. With our rack-scale plug and program play, a customer, able to put the system, deploy the system online in the next day or next few days instead of the next few weeks. So time-to-online savings is a big advantage to customers. \r\nAt the same time, the deep cooling, they help customer save energy power. So customer can allocate, relocate the energy power to power more computing equipment instead of waste of power for air cool. So saving money, that benefits a lot of leading customers and also rack-scale plug and play that make customer time-to-online. So we continue to gain more new customers while our old customers continue to grow, start to grow faster with our beta offering. So GP200, same thing, right? GP200, each rack will be around be 100k watt. So a lot of customers like that, and we help them build their liquid cooling system and optimize their data center for liquid cooling. So we are growing customer base strongly now.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nI wanted to ask about gross margins. Strong gross margins for the quarter. I know you're guiding to a sequential decline in gross margins. If our math is right, I think that implies 13.5% to 14% gross margins for the June quarter -- sorry, for the June quarter. Is that the right way to think about gross margins on a go-forward basis? Do you still feel comfortable with the prior 14% to 17% long-term gross margins? And any comments just around AI server gross margins in general? And if there are any ancillary services and support that can help improve the margin on just the product sales?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So our target is still 14% to 17%. If you look at our guide for Q2 -- I'm sorry, for Q3, we actually guided slightly down and we ended up slightly up. And so it's very hard to guide exactly on the margins. There is a range. And in fact, I think the guide inside of the -- inside the models, last time, was even more conservative. So I would say we build conservatively and then seek to overachieve. So I think if you look at our guide for revenue and for OpEx, you'll be able to determine our guide there. But our target is definitely to stay in the 14% to 17% range.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nYes. I'll try and slip in 2 here, if I can. So I guess one of the just kind of housekeeping questions is a very significant increase in inventory this quarter. I know you said that it came in towards the end of the quarter. How do we think about the trajectory of inventory as the supply comes on? Do you expect inventory to stay at this level? Do you expect it to start to come down? I'm just kind of curious how we think that flow through kind of looks as you take on more supply. And then just a quick housekeeping thing, too, is that the 21% customer you referenced in the prepared remarks, is that the same customer, large customer you had last quarter? Or how has that evolved?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nTwo reasons we had to increase inventory: One is because Q4, I mean, June quarter, we will have a strong revenue growth; a second reason because we're preparing for high-volume liquid cooling. Again, we have more than 1,000 of 100k watt, I mean, liquid cooling rack we have to ship to customers in Q4. And liquid cooling as you know, is pretty new. So we had to prepare enough inventory so that we can deliver liquid cooling rack scale product to customer on time or with minimal lead time. So both factor, indeed, is a positive factor. And with our economic scale continuing to grow, indeed, our inventory average [daily], indeed, will slightly improve.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So Aaron, my take on that is I hope that our inventory continues to grow because that means there's a reason behind it, so -- and it's tied to sales. So to your second question, the 21% customer was the same as last quarter. And I wanted to let you know that in the Q, we're going to be moving to a customer A, customer B, customer C because as we add more customers, we'll try to make it easier to make those distinguishments.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of George Wang with Barclays.\n\nDong Wang\n\nCongrats on the strong June guide. I'd like to put it in 2 parts quickly, just -- not asking for a specific guidance for FY '25 or the September, December quarter. But any sort of high-level kind of color you can provide just to think about how to model the September, December and also the FY '25. And also kind of related, kind of, can you pass out kind of utilization in the March quarter? And also kind of what's the expected utilization kind of cadence for the next few quarters?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. As you know, we have a lot of new product coming soon, right, to support the NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GP200 and AMD MI300 and Intel Gaudi2, Gaudi3. So we have a lot of new product already and plus liquid cooling DLC, we are ready to ship high-volume product. So for sure, I mean, candidate -- I mean fiscal year '25, I mean, for September, December quarter, we will have strong growth. And I believe this strong growth will continue for many quarters to come, if not many years. I believe it will be many years.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\n\nAnanda Prosad Baruah\n\nYes. Really, really appreciate it. And Charles, let me -- maybe to the remarks you made a moment ago about the strong ongoing growth, does that -- could that mean that you could also grow sequentially from this point forward for a little bit, just given the market share gain opportunities, the components coming online that you talked about in the new products? Any context on way to think about sequential growth sort of in the coming quarters would be helpful as well.\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. As you know, traditionally, in the last 10 years, right, I mean, the September quarter and March quarter, always our soft quarter. But now with AI, we've been growing so strong. So we basically are able to grow sequentially. So although March and September be a little weak, but basically, because of strong AI growth and our market share growing, so the sequential growth will become the normal. And basically, I mean, we have even better technologies than before ever, and now economic scale become much bigger. Malaysia campus production will be ready by end of this calendar year, so we see a lot of positive factors to grow our business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\n\nJonathan E. Tanwanteng\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit more to the gross margins. And if you expect them to go structurally higher at some point in the near future, in the coming quarters, especially if Malaysia ramps, you get economies of scale there as you transition to do products and you add more liquid cooling. Is there a point where that starts to revert higher? Or do you expect it to remain at a relatively constant level for the foreseeable future?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nAgain, the AI reform is getting popular, right? So they are more and more competitive as well. So we will try to keep a balance. To grow market, we may -- sometimes, some deal, we may have to be a little bit more aggressive in pricing. But overall, we try to keep a balance. David, you may add some here.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. And also I agree with your point that Malaysia will also offer some opportunity to us. And we're also at a transition time when there's a lot of new -- we have a lot of new platforms that are coming out and the customers are highly anticipating. And those platforms are built on some emerging technologies that -- from many different areas. And we -- Supermicro's strength, again, is its fast time to market. And we expect with these -- with the emerging technologies and our new platforms and our liquid cooling to be first out there with very compelling solutions. So we think those things are all going to be helping our margins.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\n\nMehdi Hosseini\n\nYes. A couple for me. Regarding the channel customer, the 17% of the customer, have you ever had a channel customer that big? I believe in the past, you've talked about a 21%-, 20%-plus customer, but I think this is new. Can you clarify this?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nSo this is an existing customer, and we actually had a higher customer back in 2022, Mehdi, but I think they were around 22%. But this is still a really good customer, a really good opportunity.\n\nMehdi Hosseini\n\nOkay. Great. And then 1 question for you, David, on the cash flow. Actually, there is -- I believe there are 2 items. There is $110 million of cash burn in operation and then there was also a noncurrent asset. Am I missing something here? These 2 items were big items that had an impact to our overall cash flow, is that correct?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nSure. We had a number of things that impacted this. I think in noncurrent assets, we had -- deferred taxes grew by quite a bit this year -- or this quarter, and so that was something unusual. And then -- see, I think those are -- I think that's the only unusual item was the deferred taxes grew a lot, and that's what lowered our tax rate, our quarterly tax rate as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.\n\nNehal Sushil Chokshi\n\nCongrats on a strong guide here. Talk about the guide here. Inventory increased $1.5 billion Q-over-Q. And Dave, as you mentioned, you'd like to see inventory increase. I do too because it's a strong indicator of things to come. And you guided June quarter to increase by $1.6 billion Q-over-Q. If I do this math, where I'm looking at the inventory at the quarter end and then the [fourth] quarter revenue, typically, it's around 60% to 70% of revenue. But with your March Q ending inventory and your current [June, too,] guidance, that equates to about 85% of projected revenue. So can you just explain what seems to be a little bit more usual inventory buildup given the revenue guidance range?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nSure. Absolutely. That's a fair question. So we actually got a substantial amount of inventory in the last week of the quarter, okay, which obviously, we're not going to be able to ship, but we took in $700 million in the last week of the quarter. So that's not something -- that's something that has to do with when inventory arrives. And so we -- it hurts our cash flow, but you know what, it doesn't matter, because we need that inventory for Q4 shipments.\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. Again, 2 reasons, right? Q4, we will have a strong revenue, so we had to prepare for Q4. And also, I mean, liquid cooling, I mean, it's new. So we had to prepare enough safety inventory for liquid cooling demand for June quarter and September quarter as well. So that's another reason why we have a slightly higher inventory now.\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. And I want to add, Nehal, that, that's exactly why we did capital raises, too, is to prepare for these Q4 shipments, and -- so that we could make those large purchases, and we hope to continue that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Matt Bryson with Wedbush.\n\nMatthew Stevens Bryson\n\nI would be thinking with liquid cooling ramping in fiscal Q4, not to harp on the gross margin issue, but that you would be seeing a benefit to gross margins? And I guess my question is, is there any chance that other with the liquid cooling solutions or with your other solutions, that you're again seeing some penetration at those larger customers and specifically hyperscalers, and that's why we're seeing gross margins come down? And I guess just 1 clarification for Dave. If you can provide the magnitude that revenues were affected by your inability to procure components in fiscal Q3?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nLet me add a little bit. Because liquid cooling is new to us, so to speed up quick support for some of our very important customer on June quarter, indeed, we had to pay some premium to speed up the supply. So we spend a bunch of effort there. David, you may add?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So the 2 questions, Matt, I would say, first of all, to the gross margin question, again, I tried to give a -- my philosophy is give a conservative guide and then work to exceed that and we were able to do that in Q3, and we'll do everything we can do it -- can do to beat it in Q4. But it'll depend also on what we ship. \r\nAs to the magnitude of revenue, I'll go back to the fact that our backlog is at a record high. And so what that means is that every quarter, we could have shipped more if we had more parts. And so therefore, it's an ongoing problem. And we don't rely on that as an excuse. The fact of the matter is we're glad to be able to produce the products that we're producing for some of the best companies in the world. And so we continue -- we will continue to do that. And we're very upbeat by the fact that the supply chain continues to improve each quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is a follow-up from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\n\nJonathan E. Tanwanteng\n\nI was wondering if you could speak to your cash usage expectations over the next quarter or 2. Are the proceeds from your recent capital raise is all spoken for as you look to the growth in the pipeline and the record backlog you spoke to? Or do you think that's more in reserve for growth further down the line?\n\nDavid E. Weigand\n\nYes. So the way I would answer that is, is that I hope that I have -- I need more capital, Jon, because that means that we're booking -- that we're growing revenues even faster. So we've got capital adequate to get us through the current market, which means today. But in a week, that -- we hope that, that changes, and we hope that we've got orders that require even more capital. So all I can say is I hope that -- I'm hoping for the need for more capital.\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. We believe our revenue will continue to grow strong. And that's why we need more capital to grow faster. If we grow 20%, 30%, we may have enough capital now, but it will grow much faster. Then for sure, we need more capital to grow stronger.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today is a follow-up from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital.\n\nNehal Sushil Chokshi\n\nThis is for Charles. Charles, with the capital base that you have now, and I hear you, David, that you hope that you will need more capital. But with the capital base that you have now, technology advantage that you've always had that you've added to, is there anything else that you need in order to become the #1 vendor?\n\nCharles Liang\n\nYes. Indeed, our brand is very ambitious. Let me use that word. We have a very ambitious brand. So we try to continue to grow very strong, kind of 3x to 5x faster than the industry's average. So when that case happen, and we believe so, we hope so, then for sure, we need more capital.\r\nThank you. Thank you. See you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. Have an excellent rest of your day.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI Hardware Stocks Get Pummeled Even as Big Tech Keeps Spending",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The good news for makers of semiconductors and other artificial intelligence computing hardware: tech giants plan to keep spending heavily. The bad news is that investors are harder to impress this earnings season.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market NYC Police Break Up Columbia Protest and Clashes Erupt at UCLA Lilly Soars as Forecast Boost Shows Weight-Loss Drugs’ Power Amazon Posts Strongest Cloud Sales Growth in a Year on AI Demand Pot Stocks Surge on Report DEA Set to Reclassify Marijuana\n\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. have sold off despite projections of rising sales from buyers of equipment used in data centers.\n\nAMD fell 6.7% in premarket trading after a raised revenue forecast for accelerator chips didn’t win over investors. Super Micro, which makes servers, slumped 13% despite quarterly projections that beat estimates.\n\nSuch declines aren’t overreactions, according to Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. “It is warranted at this point. They are meeting the FY24 estimates but nothing more than that.”\n\nHardware makers have seen their shares rally this year amid an arms race for AI computing power that’s lifting sales and profits. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index was up 12% through Tuesday, led by Nvidia Corp. with a 74% gain. Super Micro Computer had more than tripled.\n\nThe gains have raised expectations — as well as concerns that the stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves in the short term. That was evident on April 19 when Nvidia and other AI winners tumbled out of the blue ahead of Big Tech earnings reports.\n\n“Valuations in this space are clearly being driven by multiple years of earnings growth and that always embodies a higher degree of uncertainty,” said Joanne Feeney, partner and portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management.\n\nFor AMD, some analysts question how well the firm is placed to deal with “the threat of own chip production coming from companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Google,” said Garnry.\n\nAs for Super Micro, the stock is “the talk of the town. However, a long-term quality investor would likely pass on this opportunity as it is questionable how deep their moat really is in the long run. I think the market has pushed expectations too high.”\n\nWhile investors will have to wait several weeks for Nvidia to report on May 22, Qualcomm Inc. earnings are due on Wednesday afternoon. Arm Holdings Plc, which is up 35% this year, reports on May 8.\n\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor index is priced at 26 times projected profits, down from a March peak of about 30 times profits but well above the 10-year average of about 17 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nBulls will point to positive signs of demand. On Tuesday, Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud computing unit posted its strongest sales growth in a year, aided by demand for artificial intelligence services. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon’s capital expenditures would increase “meaningfully” this year, compared with 2023, primarily to support growth at Amazon Web Services.\n\nLast week, Meta Platforms Inc. raised its forecast for capital spending in 2024 by billions of dollars. Microsoft Corp.’s capital expenditures were $14 billion in the most recent quarter and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said spending will continue to rise. Alphabet Inc.’s capital expenditures were $12 billion in the first quarter and management expects similar spending for the remainder of the year.\n\nStill, beyond high investor expectations lies another major issue at play, with 10-year Treasury yields currently around the highest levels since November.\n\n“The higher Treasury yields go, the higher discount rates go and the lower the present value of cash flows and thus the lower the theoretical value of the equity goes,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n“Equity investors may be better off looking at the big wood of Treasury yields rather than the trees of quarterly results if they are to discover why the US market equity has just thrown out its worst month since September,” he said. “Even if the quarterly results season has been benign and generally lived up to high expectations.”\n\nTop Tech News\n\nTesla Inc.’s pivotal partnership with Baidu Inc. in China may amount to a U-turn of sorts for Elon Musk, who’s long claimed his company can eventually offer self-driving without high-definition maps. Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer’s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence services. Microsoft Corp.’s motivation for investing heavily and partnering with OpenAI came from a sense of falling badly behind Google, according to an internal email released Tuesday as part of the Justice Department’s antitrust case against the search giant. The prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates is weighing on crypto, underlined by deepening Bitcoin losses after the token’s worst monthly drop since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire in November 2022. The internationally recognized government of Yemen is nearing a licensing deal with Elon Musk’s Starlink to provide satellite internet service to the war-torn country, according to a senior government official.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nCDW CGI Inc Entegris Flex Avnet Riot Platforms Inc TTM Tech Extreme Networks CTS Postmarket\n\nQualcomm Cognizant Monolithic Power Ansys PTC Inc.

        "title": "5 Low Leverage Stocks to Buy Amid a Rise in Labor Cost",
        "content": "The majority of U.S. stocks ended in the red on the last day of April, as recent data reflected a higher-than-expected rise in labor costs. This data, in addition to the dismal market consensus, with most investors expecting the U.S. central bank to leave interest rates unchanged, must have added to Wall Street’s woes.\n\nIn such a situation, an investor might not feel confident about investing in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like NVIDIA NVDA, PulteGroup PHM, Montrose Environmental Group MEG, Janus Henderson Group JHG and Hamilton Insurance Group HG, which bear low leverage. Choosing them can shield investors from incurring huge losses in times of crisis.\n\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.\n\nIn finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.\n\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.\n\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\n\nThe equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.\n\nTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.\n\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ Equity\n\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\n\nWith the first-quarter earnings season in full swing, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nConsidering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\n\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.\n\nHere are the other parameters:\n\nDebt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.\r\n\r\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.\r\n\r\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\r\n\r\nPercentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.\r\n\r\nVGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\r\n\r\nEstimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.\n\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 19 stocks that made it through the screen.\n\nNVIDIA: The company is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "AMD, Super Micro tumble as earnings fall short of lofty AI expectations",
        "content": "(Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer led a selloff in chip stocks on Wednesday after their earnings disappointed investors, who had piled into the sector on hopes rising AI investments would boost demand.\n\nAMD was down 5.4% and is on course to lose more than $13 billion in market value.\n\nIts forecast of $4 billion in AI chip sales for 2024 fell short of Wall Street's lofty expectations, having been used to Nvidia's massive forecasts over the past year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, whose near-200% stock jump this year has outpaced even gains in Nvidia, tumbled over 11% as its third-quarter revenue missed estimates amid questions over the profitability of a new line of servers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"As the market is shifting more towards risk-off over the last couple of days, it's not shocking that unless these companies are beating earnings by a mile that some of the hot air is coming out of them for now,\" said Russell Hackmann, president of Hackmann Wealth Partners.\n\nExecutives of both AMD and Super Micro Computer said supply constraints were hampering their efforts to capitalize on demand for equipment powering the boom in generative AI.\n\n\"Stepping back, AMD has several customers who are all trying to ramp MI300 (AI chip) very quickly. This is stressing the supply chain to a certain extent,\" said analysts at TD Cowen.\n\n\"However, from a demand perspective, customer engagement is in fact increasing, not only for MI300X but its successor products.\"\n\nOther AI-linked chip firms also traded lower, with Marvell Technology down 1.5% and Nvidia falling 1.7%.\n\nThe stocks have widely outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index this year and powered a 11% jump in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n\nSeveral analysts were still positive on AMD, saying easing supply chain constraints should allow the company to increase its share of the AI chip market and potentially reap billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nAt least 10 analysts lowered their price target on AMD, while eight raised their view, according to LSEG data. Super Micro saw three price target increases and two cuts.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese; Additional reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Isn't Going Anywhere. Here Are 3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades.",
        "content": "You might have experimented with ChatGPT or some of the other large language models, which are part of a new frontier where artificial intelligence (AI) changes the world around us. Is this a new reality or a fad? Considering the tens of billions of dollars corporations are spending in a technological arms race, it's probably safe to say AI isn't going anywhere.\n\nThat said, having some AI exposure in your stock portfolio would be wise. We are seemingly in the early stages of understanding what AI can do today and what it can do in the future. It's critical to think in terms of decades and invest in companies poised to profit from every step forward AI takes.\n\nAfter sifting through Wall Street's best, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW), and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) stood out as companies already winning today and poised to continue their success for years.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nThe early AI king wears the crown\n\nNvidia's early and commanding lead in the semiconductor AI race has gotten much investor attention. Its shares soared over 400% over the past few years after it became clear that AI tailwinds significantly boosted Nvidia's data center business. Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips specialize in demanding computing applications like AI, and the company's CUDA software made it easy for customers to harness the chips' power.\n\nToday, analysts believe Nvidia's market share for AI chips could be between 80% and 90%, a staggering figure for an industry that could grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the early 2030s. Remember that Nvidia's total revenue was $61 billion over the past four quarters, so there is a lot of potential growth ahead -- even if competition slowly eats into Nvidia's stranglehold on market share.\n\nNvidia's competitive edge strengthens the longer it commands the AI chip market. The company's free cash flow jumped to $27 billion over the past year, a financial war chest it can use to develop cutting-edge chips and outspend others. It also means investors could see sizable share repurchases over the coming years, which will only enhance total investment returns.\n\nSnowflake makes using data easier\n\nChips do the computing work in AI, but data is the oxygen that brings AI alive. An AI model is only as effective as the data it's trained on, which makes a company like Snowflake very valuable. Snowflake is a cloud-based data storage and analytics platform that enables customers to store their data and easily query it or enhance it by introducing third-party data from its marketplace. Snowflake integrates with the major cloud platforms, so combining cloud computing with customers' data makes AI models work.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, Snowflake could virtually grow endlessly. Data grows exponentially, and Snowflake's billing is consumption-based. The more data companies store and analyze, the more they spend on Snowflake. The company boasts a stellar net revenue retention rate of 131%, meaning Snowflake can sustain double-digit growth without adding customers.\n\nBut Snowflake is adding customers. It has 9,437 customers today, up from 7,744 a year ago. There are thousands of corporations worldwide, meaning that Snowflake could be at the beginning of a multi-decade growth story.\n\nPalantir's technology elevates businesses\n\nArtificial intelligence could eventually be everywhere, but few companies will build their AI applications from the ground up. Palantir Technologies plays a significant role in delivering turnkey applications. It operates three platforms, Gotham, Foundry, and AIP, where custom software can be built and deployed. Palantir built its business with the U.S. government but has since expanded to the private sector. Today, Palantir's revenue is roughly 50-50 split between public and private sectors.\n\nThe company's commercial potential is the primary reason investors should consider Palantir a multi-decade investment. Today, Palantir has \"just\" 497 customers. We called Snowflake, a company closing in on 10,000 customers, a business with tons of room to grow. Based on that logic, Palantir has even more room to grow over the coming decades.\n\nFinancially, Palantir is already in great shape. The company is profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis and generated $2.2 billion in revenue last year. It generates $697 million in annual free cash flow and has a fortress-like balance sheet with $3.6 billion in cash against zero debt. Again, this is a financially rock-solid business with much growth ahead. These aspects of a stock can create stellar investment returns for years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AMD Stock Analysis: 3 Reasons Advanced Micro Devices Remains a Lucrative Long-Term Bet",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has achieved the status of being one of the most important semiconductor companies in the world. Advanced Micro Devices stock can keep moving up here. It outstripped Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the central processing unit space, but it has also stood its ground against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nIn 2024, the competitive environment has shifted a bit. The rise of artificial intelligence technologies has prompted chipmakers to pour resources into products that benefit from the trend. Of course, Nvidia has a head start, but AMD has made important inroads. Below are 3 reasons Advanced Micro Devices stock remains a lucrative, long-term bet.\n\nAI Demand and Advanced Micro Devices Stock\n\nIt’s always a good idea to read what contract chip manufacturers like TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) are saying about market conditions in their earnings report.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn their first quarter earnings print, TSMC reported revenues rose 16% to $18.5 billion, blowing past Wall Street’s initial estimates. Sustained demand from Nvidia for AI chips has helped push TSMC into a new era of growth. Samsung also reported a turnaround in profit due to its semiconductor business.\n\nThis spells good news for a company like AMD that plans to sell billions of its MI300X chip this year. Demand for AI has not satiated, and an entrance into the burgeoning space will be a boon for Advanced Micro Devices stock.\n\nIntel Has Been Successfully Kept at Bay\n\nOver the years, AMD has stolen market share from a company that was once America’s crown jewel of the semiconductor space: Intel.\n\nWhile Intel was focused on leveraging its own chip manufacturing capabilities, AMD chose a fabless model of chipmaking. This means instead of manufacturing in house, AMD chose contract manufacturers like TSMC to manufacturer its CPUs and GPUs.\n\nUnfortunately, Intel has fallen behind its chipmaking capabilities. In its Q1’2024 earnings report, Intel’s Foundry business, which deals with chipmaking, saw its revenue growth compress.\n\nIntel also reported sluggish revenue in its Data Center and AI business, which is attempting to compete with Nvidia directly and will also be in competition with AMD as it begins to role out its AI chips.\n\nWhile Intel will remain an important player, the unit economics remains on the side of AMD and Nvidia. Ultimately, this gives important breathing room to AMD to capture market share in the AI space.\n\nValuation is a Bit High\n\nAn aspect of AMD’s stock that could make some investors hesitant is the chipmaker’s current forward-looking valuation. As of last Friday, AMD trades at 43.5x forward earnings, which is below competitor Nvidia’s 35.1x forward earnings multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nDriving the divergence is Nvidia competitive stature in the artificial intelligence space; Wall Street analysts also expect Nvidia to reap a lot of income from being a dominant player. Most of what’s driving AMD’s financial figures to date is the CPU and GPU products going into PCs and servers, and the electronic space is still recovering.\n\nHowever, Wall Street remains optimistic about AMD’s share price prospects. According to Koyfin, there are 48 analysts covering AMD, and 37 of which have given the chipmaker’s shares a “Buy” or “Strong Buy” rating. Moreover, AMD’s current average 12-month price target implies a more than 25% potential return.\n\nInvestment bank TD Cowen was among those who have recently upgraded AMD’s price target. In mid-April, TD Cowen increased their price target from $185/share to $200/share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Shhh! 3 Secret 3D Printing Stocks Flying Below Wall Street’s Radar",
        "content": "One of the best investment strategies for long-term growth is twofold: pick an emerging sector or industry set to change how the world operates and properly timing the investment. No-brainer, right? If everyone could have predicted AI’s potential and invested in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2013 or forecast fintech’s rise and bought PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in 2015, we’d all be billionaires. However, there is one little trick to navigating early and emergent market trends.\n\nThough ZIRP-era and meme stock mania admittedly skewed the formula somewhat, snagging once-hot stocks long after enthusiasm cools (assuming the sector has a viable future and profitability pathway) is a way to buy tomorrow’s top stocks at a discount today. Just look to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as a prime example. Shares dropped nearly 20% in January 2012 after initial, post-IPO EV enthusiasm cooled and didn’t rebound appreciably for months, even years. But, if you identified the EV trend’s potential early and didn’t let market shakiness spook you, a 2012 investment would mean millionaire status today.\n\nOne such trend that’s fallen off, despite the sector’s wider potential, is 3D printing stocks. As measured by the 3D Printing ETF (BATS:PRNT), investor sentiment is nearly half it was in 2021 (as measured by NAV) to ultimately return a slim return since the ETF’s inception in 2016.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAgain, innumerable factors influence market outcomes — monetary policy being one of the biggest. But there’s little skepticism that 3D printing stocks will reemerge as the industry becomes more affordable and widespread. 3D printing already has plenty of real-world applications, and investors willing to wait for these three 3D printing stocks will be printing profit in years to come.\n\nDesktop Metal (DM)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDesktop Metal (NYSE:DM) falls firmly on the penny stock side of the 3D printing stocks spectrum, trading under $1 per share with a market cap of just $285 million. Despite its modest size, this 3D printing stock is catching wind with several bullish factors, positioning it for rapid expansion.\n\nFollowing a string of negative news, Desktop Metal is charging ahead through its healthcare-focused subsidiary, Desktop Health. Desktop Health is launching an ambitious initiative called ScanUp, targeting dental professionals to modernize their practices through digital technology. Notably, “half of the dentists in the United States have not yet adopted intraoral scanning,” which is a crucial first step towards digitizing dental services. This untapped market presents a significant opportunity for Desktop Metal, offering a predictable, recurring revenue stream through ScanUp’s 36-month subscription plan. Recurring revenue is increasingly Desktop Metal’s goal, considering the company posted a 29% year-over-year recurring revenue increase in its end-of-year report.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond expanded recurring revenue, Desktop Metal significantly reduced its net loss to $323.4 million from $740.3 million the previous year. While it continues to stride towards profitability, Desktop Metal represents a high-risk, high-reward investment among the more speculative 3D printing stocks, considering its bottom-barrel pricing and potential upside.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) Is Autodesk Stock Still A Buy At New Highs? 3 Pros, 3 Cons\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the larger end of the market capitalization spectrum, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) offers stability and proven methods alongside a more diversified series of revenue streams compared to other 3D printing stocks. Autodesk’s software, like its Fusion 360 platform, enables users to design and test 3D models digitally and integrates directly with printers to materialize designs. Unlike other big-name 3D printing stocks, Autodesk also facilitates subtractive finishing, which involves removing material from objects to enhance precision in specialized engineering and manufacturing projects — the 3D-printing equivalent of carving a statue from marble.\n\nFor investors looking to tap into the long-term potential of 3D printing stocks while mitigating the risks associated with pure-play 3D printing companies, Autodesk presents a compelling choice. Its software caters to a broad range of industries, including construction, entertainment, education and engineering, ensuring its utility extends far beyond today’s emergent 3D printing applications, broadening its customer base and revenue streams.\n\nAltair Engineering (ALTR) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltair Engineering (NASDAQ:ALTR), a mid-cap 3D printing stock, focuses primarily on software that supports product development and analysis before advancing to the next stage in the 3D printing process. Its software suite, essential for complex engineering tasks where product tolerances are incredibly fine, played a key role in closing 2023 on a high note despite earlier weaknesses in the sector.\n\nAltair reported $155.9 million in software revenue in the fourth quarter, marking a 7.6% increase year-over-year. That figure includes contributions from its 3D printing segment software licensing as well as direct, on-the-ground engineering assistance and consultations to help companies kickstart their engineering workflows. The company also achieved earnings per share of 22 cents and nearly doubled its free cash flow YoY to $19.3 million.\n\nFor the entire year, Altair’s software sales reached $550 million, up 8.6% YoY, and it significantly reduced its net loss to $8.9 million from 2022’s $43.4 million. Despite these positive year-end results, Altair’s shares have not yet reached the average analyst price target of $90 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Nvidia Could Help This Stock-Split ETF Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million in 10 Years",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could be one of the most valuable opportunities in history for investors, and the semiconductor industry is at the heart of it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang believes there is a whopping $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that must be upgraded with new chips to support demand from AI developers.\n\nNvidia is leading the charge right now, but it won't be the only beneficiary of that opportunity. However, rather than trying to pick which stocks might be the winners and losers over the long term, investors should consider buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) instead.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX) is a specialized fund that invests exclusively in the world's top chip companies, and Nvidia is its largest holding. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) just completed a stock split\n\nThe SOXX ETF delivered a spectacular compound annual return of 30.4% over the last five years. That's almost triple the yearly return in the S&P 500 index over the same period.\n\nIn fact, the SOXX ETF recently soared to $680 per share, which made it somewhat inaccessible to smaller investors. As a result, iShares executed a 3-for-1 stock split in March, which increased the number of SOXX shares in circulation threefold, bringing its stock price down by two-thirds organically. It had no impact on the underlying value of the ETF, but it means investors can now buy in for as little as $217 (as of this writing).\n\nConsidering the substantial AI opportunity ahead for the chip sector, the momentum in the SOXX ETF will likely continue long into the future. Here's how it could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million in 10 years -- but don't fret, investors with any amount of starting capital can benefit from a fivefold return if this opportunity pans out.\n\nEvery leading chip stock, conveniently packed into one ETF\n\nNvidia designs some of the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI workloads. They are fitted inside centralized data centers operated by tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon, which in turn sell the computing power to developers so they can build, train, and deploy their AI models.\n\nNvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to a year-over-year increase of 217% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28) to $47.5 billion. That piece of hardware is the primary reason Nvidia is now a $2.2 trillion company -- and considering the new, more advanced H200 GPU is now shipping, the momentum will likely continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe SOXX ETF owns stakes in 30 different chip companies, but it's heavily weighted toward its top five holdings, which account for 35.4% of the total value of its portfolio:\n\nStock SOXX ETF Weighting 1. Nvidia 8.88% 2. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) 8.28% 3. Qualcomm 6.57% 4. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) 6.55% 5. Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) 5.08%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 26, 2024, and are subject to change.\n\nThe ETF's second-largest holding is Broadcom, which is a leader in networking and connectivity hardware for data centers. Its Tomahawk 5 switch, for example, is designed to speed up how quickly data travels from one point to another, which is critical in data centers with thousands of GPUs ingesting mountains of information every second. Broadcom also develops AI software on several fronts through its subsidiaries, including VMWare and Symantec.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is another key holding for the SOXX ETF. The company recently launched its MI300 data center chips to compete with Nvidia, and they have already attracted big customers like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms. Plus AMD is a leader in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing market. Millions of notebooks and devices have already been sold with the company's Ryzen AI chips.\n\nRounding out the top five is Micron Technology, which is a leading producer of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips. Its HBM3E memory solution was selected by Nvidia to power the new H200 GPU, primarily because of its incredible efficiency. It consumes 30% less power than competing solutions, which is a key consideration for data center operators because electricity is one of their largest costs.\n\nOutside of the top five, the SOXX ETF owns popular chip stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments. It also has a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is responsible for making more than half of the world's chips, including those designed by Nvidia and AMD.\n\nThe SOXX ETF could turn $200,000 to $1 million in a decade\n\nThe SOXX ETF has gained 53.5% over the past year, which crushes the 22.3% return of the S&P 500, and even trounces the 33.9% return of the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nAnd that outperformance isn't an anomaly. The ETF delivered a compound annual return of 30.4% over the last five years, and 25.3% over the last 10 years. Technologies like cloud computing and AI have only gone mainstream over the past decade, which explains the incredible performance.\n\nBesides Jensen Huang's forecasted $1 trillion opportunity for the data center industry, every computer and device could also be fitted with AI capabilities over the long term, so continued market-beating returns in the SOXX ETF is a real possibility.\n\nBut even if the SOXX ETF delivered a more moderate annual return of 15% over the next 10 years, it would still lead to significant financial gains for investors. The table below shows how different returns would affect an initial investment of $200,000:\n\nInitial Investment Compound Annual Return Balance After 10 Years $200,000 15% $809,111 $200,000 20% $1,238,347 $200,000 25% $1,862,645 $200,000 30% $2,757,169\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nThe SOXX ETF is a great way for investors to play the AI opportunity over the long term, especially after its recent stock split, which makes it far more accessible to those of all experience levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them.

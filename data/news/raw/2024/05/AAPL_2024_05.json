        "content": "Investors in Apple, Inc AAPL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 21, 2024 $5.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Apple shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Apple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer-Mini computer industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.31 per share to $1.33 per share in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Apple right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.\n\nClick to see the trades now >>\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "NVIDIA is a shoo-in for the Dow post stock split",
        "content": "With its latest earnings report, AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a ten-for-one stock split. The split, which will be distributed at the close on June 7th, will give shareholders ten shares in exchange for each one share they own as of the June 6th record date. The stock will start trading split-adjusted at market open on Monday, June 10th. The split raises the very real possibility that NVIDIA will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), with chip-laggard Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) seen as the company it will likely replace.\n\nThe Dow is a price a price-weighted index, meaning stocks with higher prices have a bigger impact on the index. With NVIDIA’s stock over $1000 per share currently, this would give it too much of a weighting in the index. However, with the ten-for-one split, the stock price would be closer to the $100 level – making an entry into the Dow more feasible and likely.\n\nThe last change for the Dow was in August 2020, when Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) replaced ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).\n\nWhen asked to comment on speculation that NVIDIA will soon be added to the Dow, S&P Dow Jones Indices, the firm behind the index, said it does not comment or speculate on index additions or deletions.\n\nHowever, reading the DJIA methodology language carefully hints that NVIDIA will, in fact, be added, and the announcement can come at any time.\n\nIt reads: “While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Companies should be incorporated and headquartered in the U.S., and a plurality of revenues should be derived from the U.S. Changes to the indices are made on an as-needed basis. There is no annual or semi-annual reconstitution. Rather, changes in response to corporate actions and market developments can be made at any time. Constituent changes are typically announced one to five days before they are scheduled to be implemented. At any given time, the constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones Transportation Average and Dow Jones Utility Average make up the Dow Jones Composite Average.” (bolded by Investing.com)\n\nStory continues\n\nFive reasons NVIDIA should replace Intel in the Dow\n\nNVIDIA is the third-largest company in the world, with a market value of $2.7 trillion—behind only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a market value of just over $3 trillion, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has a market value of $2.9 trillion. Apple and Microsoft are both in the Dow.\n\nIt is the leader in AI, powering applications like ChatGPT, which is expected to be bigger than the Internet.\n\nNVIDIA now dwarfs the once-mighty Intel, which has a market cap of only $128 billion. Intel is the lowest-priced stock in the Dow, and its market cap is near the bottom of the list.\n\nNVIDIA is expected to post revenue of $111.38 billion this year versus $52 billion for Intel. NVIDIA’s growth is also astonishing versus Intel’s lack of growth. NVIDIA’s revenue is expected to grow by 83% this year, while Intel’s is expected to fall by 5%.\n\nThe inclusion of NVIDIA in the Dow will also be an admission by the DJIA Index Committee that AI is the future of all industries, not just technology.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNVIDIA is a shoo-in for the Dow post stock split\n\nBoston Beer reportedly in sale talks to Suntory: WSJ\n\nUS lawmakers ask FBI for briefing on GenScript Biotech's links to China\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia could soon surpass Apple to become the world's second-most valuable company, as the kingmaker behind the AI revolution takes on the iPhone maker that has ruled Wall Street for decades.\n\nThe reliance of virtually all artificial intelligence applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT on Nvidia's high-end chips has helped the stock nearly triple in value over the past year to $2.72 trillion.\n\nIn contrast, Apple ceded its No. 1 spot to Microsoft earlier this year as the once high-flying company grapples with weak demand for its iPhones and tough competition in China. It was last valued at $2.93 trillion.\n\n\"It is certainly notable because Apple has been so dominant for so long, especially on the growth and innovation front. Recently though, Apple's innovation curve seems to have flattened, showing slower future growth,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\n\"On the other hand, Nvidia has been able to catch wave upon wave of growth. Beginning with gaming demand, then crypto and now AI, they have been able to perfectly match innovation with demand and that equals explosive growth.\"\n\nThe semiconductor company is heavily weighted on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq and has been pivotal in driving U.S. stocks to record highs. It accounted for more than a third of the S&P 500's gains this year.\n\nNvidia also became the fastest company to grow from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in 2024, zooming past Amazon.com, Google-parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco.\n\nSince its blowout forecast about a year ago, the company has consistently breezed past Wall Street's lofty expectations for revenue and profit, with demand for its graphic processors far outstripping supply as Big Tech rushes to embed AI applications.\n\nSharp increases in analysts' earnings estimates have resulted in a fall in the stock's forward earnings valuation, even with the share price racing higher.\n\nIt traded at 37 times forward earnings, compared with 48 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.\n\nNvidia is also popular in the derivatives market. GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF, which tracks twice the daily percentage change in Nvidia, is the largest single stock ETF.\n\nThe fund clocked $1 billion in daily turnover for the first time ahead of Nvidia's results last week and its total net assets have hit a record $2.82 billion this week, according to Lipper data.\n\nOptions traders are bullish as Nvidia's volumes, particularly for calls, has picked up in recent sessions after the surge in its stock price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday marked the fifth straight session where more than a million Nvidia call options changed hands, the longest such streak in the stock's history, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView comments",

An insider revealed to The Financial Times that Microsoft pressured OpenAI to prioritize commercial products, exacerbating existing tensions between executives.\n\nDespite these challenges, OpenAI’s valuation has soared to $90 billion since launching ChatGPT.\n\nAltman is considering converting OpenAI into a for-profit corporation to attract significant capital and expand its AI infrastructure.\n\nOpenAI’s annual revenue crossed the $2 billion mark. The ChatGPT parent eyes doubling revenue by 2025.\n\nMicrosoft stock gained over 26% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "Being a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) board member will look a little different for Warren Buffett's eldest son Howard G. Buffett, once his legendary dad is no longer chairman.\n\nAnd he knows that will change a life that has long consisted of frequent world travel for philanthropic ventures, alongside a daily routine of being a farmer that tills his own land.\n\n\"I've been to a hundred fifty five countries or something. And I'm on the road a lot. I've been in Ukraine five times in 2022. And the same thing five times in 2023, and probably four or five times this year. So those are trips I won't make,\" Buffett told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above).\n\nThe board is widely expected to vote Buffett — who has been on the board since 1993 — in as non-executive chairman.\n\nBuffett, 69, is seen as the \"guardian\" of the unique Berkshire culture that his father and long-time lieutenant Charlie Munger created over the decades. The business itself is a beast, requiring expert planning and oversight by the Berkshire board.\n\nThe business varies from operating one of the nation's most important railroads in Burlington Northern, to supporting the housing market via homebuilder Clayton Homes.\n\nBuffett has an extensive management resume, ranging from working in investor relations at commodities player Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), to being a board member of his dad's favorite drink and legacy stock investment Coca-Cola (KO). (He retired from the Coke board in 2016 after 17 years).\n\nBuffett is also the chairman and CEO of the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, which was founded in 1999. TODAY -- Pictured: (l-r) Warren Buffett and Howard G. Buffett appear on NBC News' \"Today\" show -- (Photo by: Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC Newswire/NBCUniversal via Getty Images) (NBC NewsWire via Getty Images)\n\nA good chunk of the foundation's work in recent years has been targeted to war-torn Ukraine. Buffett tells me the nonprofit is on track to donate $800 million to the country this year, and is eyeing another $250 million for 2025.\n\n\"I will need to keep in mind that I just need to be around to do my job [at Berkshire] and my responsibility. So I think the risk level of what I do in my life today probably gets decreased,\" said Buffett. \"I won't be running the company as a non-executive chairman. My job will be to support Greg [future CEO Greg Abel] in every way that I can.\"\n\nBerkshire investors got a look into its future earlier this month.\n\nIts annual shareholder meeting marked a new era for the Oracle of Omaha. It was his first without his right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who passed away on Nov. 28, 2023, just shy of his 100th birthday.\n\nBuffett described Munger as the “architect of Berkshire,” and his request to shareholders to “join me in applauding Charlie” was met with cheers and a standing ovation. The packed house included Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In terms of having a partner, I simply cannot think of a conversation I had with Charlie that he misled me,” Buffett later said.\n\nSuccession isn't an easy thing to pull off at any company. Former long-time Cisco CEO John Chambers weighs in on how he laid the groundwork for future leaders on a recent episode of the 'Opening Bid' podcast.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Recommends Buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Heading Into June",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer's Top 10 Stock Picks for June. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks higher in the list, the stock deserves a deeper look. But first, let's see what Cramer was talking about during his programs earlier this week.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program lamented over Salesforce's latest declines following the company's weak Q1 results and guidance cut. Cramer said he's been \"championing\" Salesforce ever since the company went public since he's used the Cloud software company's product when he started Street.com. Cramer said Salesforce has been one of the most \"distinguished\" members of the enterprise software industry. Cramer identified competition as one of the biggest threats to Salesforce, since he believes every other \"young person\" coming out of the school majoring in computer science knows if you want to make money you should make or sell software for the enterprise world.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence revolution is jolting the SaaS world to its core, according to Cramer, as companies begin to explore the power of AI and question whether they should keep paying for SaaS subscriptions or hire more people when AI-based tools can do similar jobs in a more efficient way.\n\nCramer's NVDA Thesis Still Holds?\n\nJim Cramer, however, said that companies that are making AI transition easier for companies are in \"ascendancy.\" He thinks a personal computer equipped with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell Platform could make \"vast swaths of workforce obsolete.\" Cramer has been recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past several months, and in his latest programs he yet again urged investors to buy and hold the stock. However, valuations concerns around NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are increasing. NVDA bears believe the Wall Street's EPS estimate for NVDA for two years from now, which is close to $40 (latest quarterly EPS was $5.98), would only hold if Cloud and software companies continue to buy Nvidia chips at a rate that we are seeing today. Since major Cloud companies are \"front-loading\" chips amid competition and data center boom, it's highly unlikely Nvidia continues to see this high sales and income growth in the long term.\n\nOur latest research unlocked many AI-related stocks trading at attractive valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired over the past two weeks and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in the company. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nA caller highlighted in Jim Cramer's latest show that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock recently shot up after latest data from China showed a rebound in iPhone sales. Data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) shows that iPhone shipments in April surged 52% to 3.489 million units, driven by discounts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is offering to lure back customers. Cramer said the stock jumped on the news but pared back gains. Cramer thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"is a buy here\" and reiterated his age-old mantra:\n\n\"I want you to own it, not trade it.\"\n\nInvestors are also looking over their shoulders for any major AI announcement by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), especially during the upcoming Developers Conference. Bank of America recently reiterated an Outperform rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). BofA's Wamsi Mohan, who has a $230 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), is expecting AI-phone related announcements in the Developers Conference.\n\nHedge fund sentiment around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shot up in the first quarter, with 150 hedge funds ending the period with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares in their portfolios, up from 131 funds in the previous quarter.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter due to the strategy’s underweight relative to the benchmark. Investors continue to be concerned about weak handset sales globally, as well as declining market share and competitive dynamics in the Chinese market, as Huawei has returned to the market with a more competitive premium-priced handset. Apple has yet to demonstrate a competitive AI product, which could present further competitive headwinds for the company.”\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 1st in Insider Monkey’s list of the Jim Cramer's 10 Stock Picks Heading Into June.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Unearthing Unknown Stocks: 3 Picks That Could Be the Next Big Thing",
        "content": "Sometimes the next big thing stocks to buy and hold are flying well under the radar.\n\nLook at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). When Apple went public in 1980, it was an unknown stock that nearly filed for bankruptcy. All thanks to financial instability and fierce competition. Since then, it’s become a household name worth $2.92 trillion, making some of its biggest holders filthy rich.\n\nOr, look at Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA). At one point, no one knew what MARA was, or even why they should be excited about a Bitcoin mining stock. But once the opportunity was discovered, the miner exploded from about 62 cents to a recent high of $20.25.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt one point, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was an unknown. So much so, that Jeff Bezos had to convince his siblings to invest $10,000 each in the now $1.9 trillion stock. Needless to say, it was a wise move.\n\nDo stocks like these still exist? You bet.\n\nAre they easy to spot? Nope. Just as we saw with Apple, Marathon, and Amazon, you have to dig through a lot of garbage, do your due diligence, and have a good deal of patience. So, no, not easy at all. But here are a few unknown stocks that may have similar potential.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) wasn’t one of the most well-known stocks in the telecom world.\n\nBut that quickly changed earlier this week. All after ASTS, which is building the first global cellular broadband network in space, inked a deal with Verizon (NYSE:VZ). With a commitment of $100 million from Verizon, the two companies will provide direct-to-cellular Space Mobile service when needed for Verizon customers.\n\nThe two are attempting to improve cellular services all over the U.S. “We will now be able to use our spectrum in conjunction with AST’s satellite network to provide essential connectivity in remote corners of the U.S. where cellular signals are unreachable through traditional land-based infrastructure,” said Srini Kalapala, Verizon’s senior vice president of technology and product development, in the release.\n\nEven better, it also inked an agreement with AT&T (NYSE:T) earlier this month to provide its space-based network directly to cell phones. All of which is a major commercial milestone for ASTS.\n\nStructure Therapeutics (GPCR) An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around it\n\nSource: ra2 studio/Shutterstock\n\nStructure Therapeutics (NASDAQ:GPCR) isn’t a well-known weight loss treatment stock just yet. But it may soon be. According to JPMorgan, it’s an overlooked player in the weight loss treatment market. The firm has an overweight rating on the stock, with a price target of $65.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We think the opportunity for oral GLP-1s is underappreciated and think this market could generate $30bn in sales by 2035,” added the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “GPCRs lead asset, 1290, is a pure-play option for this opportunity, and even a small share would support substantial upside to the stock.”\n\nBetter, its addressable market is substantial. According to the World Obesity Federation, “In its World Obesity Atlas 2023, the federation said the economic impact of overweight and obesity on the world is set to reach $4.32tn—nearly 3% of global gross domestic product.”\n\nMuch like we’ve seen with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), the upside can be explosive. Even better, with new weight loss treatments, the market could be worth $100 billion by 2030, says Goldman Sachs.\n\nFluence Energy (FLNC) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buy\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile a good number of us are familiar with Fluence Energy (NASDAQ:FLNC) at this point. It’s still under-appreciated, especially with an increase in artificial intelligence-driven electricity demand.\n\nUBS analysts have a buy rating and a $32 price target on FLNC. They also note it’s “poised to benefit from the growing demand for electricity by AI data centers,” as noted by Investing.com. “Fluence Energy’s role as a significant supplier is seen as undervalued, particularly in the context of the shift towards 100% renewable energy policies by corporations.”\n\nGoldman Sachs also included FLNC on its list of stocks to buy, with data center demand expected to rise. The “U.S. power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation. Not since the start of the century has U.S. electricity demand grown 2.4% over an eight-year period, with U.S. annual power generation over the last 20 years averaging less than 0.5% growth,” Goldman Sachs added.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Although there is no hard-and-fast rule about what constitutes a blue-chip stock, they all tend to have certain qualities. They are large, financially stable companies that have been through numerous business and economic cycles that proved their worth in the end.\n\nThe upper echelon of the S&P 500 are the sort of stocks that comprise blue-chip stocks. Yet investors need to be careful because “blue-chip” doesn’t always mean the same thing to everyone. The T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:TCHP), for example, includes Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that are easily recognizable blue-chip stocks. Yet the exchange-traded fund (ETF) also includes some head-scratchers like Carvana (NASDAQ:CVNA).\n\nWhat follows are three blue-chip growth stocks that most investors would agree fit the definition and offer significant opportunities for substantial wealth creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough some might put Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) in the same category as Carvana, the ride-share leader is a solid, financially sound business that continues growing. Its brand is known globally and it’s name has become a verb for people wanting a ride somewhere, even when they are using competing services.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 15% to $10.3 billion as gross bookings surged 20% to 37.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rocketed 82% higher for the period, hitting nearly $1.4 billion as Uber generated almost $1.4 billion in free cash flow.\n\nHaving expanded beyond just simple ride-hailing services, Uber Technologies now also delivers food, groceries, packages and even freight. It is also investing heavily into driverless vehicles and the nascent electric vehicle takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft industry. The self-driving car initiative would dramatically boost revenue and profits as the company would no longer need to split fares with drivers.\n\nWith Uber Technologies stock down 22% from recent highs and earnings expected to grow 47% annually for the next five years, the ride-share leader is a blue-chip growth stock with a bright future.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt doesn’t garner the kinds of headlines as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) but chipmaker Marvell Technologies (NASDAQ:MRVL) is carving out a new path for itself in artificial intelligence (AI). Best known as a maker of semiconductors for the fiber optics industry, the chipmaker is applying its electro-optical expertise to develop AI chips for data centers. For example,  Marvell’s Nova 1.6 terabytes per second PAM4 electro-optics platform — an industry first for speed — enables the high-speed movement of data in AI, machine learning (ML) and data center networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarvell is racking up wins with hyperscalers and recently announced its third hyperscale cloud customer for its custom chip business. Wall Street analysts think the chipmaker has already won over the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google as customers.  It shows how Marvell’s pivot to new verticals like data center infrastructure provides a new foundation for long-term growth. The data center industry is positioned for significant expansion and Marvell Technology will be riding the wave higher.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nDrugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) already caught its own wave of opportunity, as treatments for diabetes and obesity created a tsunami of epic proportions. Mounjaro and Zepbound use terzepatide as a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist to treat the conditions. The response has been phenomenal.\n\nGlobal Mounjaro sales more than tripled to $1.8 billion in the first quarter following U.S. approval, while Zepbound drew in $517 million in sales in its first full quarter after approval. The twin therapies helped Eli Lilly raise its 2024 guidance by $2 billion to a range of $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion.\n\nThe pharmaceutical stock also has a portfolio of existing treatments and a pipeline of drugs in clinical trials. Eli Lilly is also willing to buy what it needs to plug any holes. Last year it bought radiopharmaceutical company Point Biopharma for $1.4 billion and just announced it will invest $60 million into Atkis Oncology to gain access to its miniprotein platform to develop anticancer radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals are a new class of cancer drugs containing radioactive isotopes to deliver radiation therapy directly to cancer cells.\n\nEli Lilly struck gold with Mounjaro and Zepbound but that’s not the only place place the drugmaker is panning for riches.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

        "title": "Here Are All 6 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling",
        "content": "For the better part of six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been running circles around the benchmark S&P 500. Whereas the S&P 500 has delivered a very respectable aggregate total return, including dividends paid, of roughly 34,500% since the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" took over as CEO, Buffett has overseen an aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 4,950,000%.\n\nWhen you outperform Wall Street's major stock indexes by this magnitude, you're going to gain quite the following. It's why approximately 40,000 people trek to Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting to hear Buffett speak about stocks, the U.S. economy, and his investment philosophy.\n\nHowever, nuggets of wisdom can be found outside of these annual meetings. Every quarter, institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a concise snapshot for investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers have been buying and selling.\n\nThe interesting thing about Warren Buffett is that he's been a net-seller of equities for six consecutive quarters. Based on Berkshire's 13F that details trading activity during the first quarter, Warren Buffett was a seller of six stocks. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple: Sold 116,191,550 shares (reduced stake by 12.83%)\n\nThe eye-popper during the first quarter was undeniably the admission that Buffett and his team sold a sizable percentage of their top holding, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Despite a second consecutive quarter of reductions, Apple still accounts for about 40% of Berkshire's $371 billion of invested assets.\n\nDuring Berkshire's annual meeting, the Oracle of Omaha justified this selling activity by pointing to corporate tax rates. Buffett opined that it was probable corporate income tax rates would increase from the currently low historic rate of 21% in the future, so it would be prudent to lock in some of Berkshire's capital gains in Apple now. He postulated that investors would come to appreciate this decision over time.\n\nYet even with this massive reduction, Warren Buffett has complete faith in Berkshire's top holding and its CEO, Tim Cook. Cook is the process of overseeing a multiyear transition that has Apple focused on higher-margin subscription services. As subscriptions grow into a larger percentage of total sales, it'll help smooth out the revenue swings observed during iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple also has the most robust capital-return program on the planet. Since initiating a share repurchase program in 2013, the company has bought back an aggregate of $674 billion of its common stock. Buffett is a huge fan of buybacks, which increase Berkshire's ownership stake in high-quality companies over time.\n\n2. Paramount Global: Sold entire stake (63,322,491 shares)\n\nMedia stockParamount Global(NASDAQ: PARA) was completely shown the door since 2023 began. Although Berkshire's 13F points to an 88.11% reduction in shares through March 31, Buffett admitted during his company's annual meeting that he'd sold the entire stake at a loss.\n\nLegacy media companies like Paramount have fallen victim to the ongoing cord-cutting trend. Paramount has been actively building out its streaming services and content library, but has been losing copious amounts of money in the process. While it does possess reasonably strong subscription pricing power, it doesn't appear as if the company's streaming operations will be profitable anytime soon.\n\nThe advertising market has been challenging, as well. While 2024 offers a bounce-back year for legacy media networks with political ad spending picking up, select indicators and money-based metrics pointing toward a recession aren't encouraging businesses to increase their marketing budgets.\n\n3. HP: Sold entire stake (22,852,715 shares)\n\nSimilar to Paramount, the writing was on the wall that personal computing and printing services company HP(NYSE: HPQ) was getting the boot from Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Shares of HP were reduced in a big way during the fourth quarter, which is often the telltale sign that Buffett's investment thesis in a company has been broken.\n\nAlthough HP is undeniably cheap on the basis of forward-year earnings (a multiple of 9 times consensus earnings per share), demand for personal computers (PCs) is taking longer to rebound than first anticipated. Though PC demand spiked during the initial stages of the pandemic when people were stuck in their homes, a return to \"normal\" has proved troublesome for this key revenue segment. Unsurprisingly, HP's sales are expected to be flat in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, HP's capital-return program may not have been hitting home for Buffett and his team. Following $4.3 billion in share buybacks in fiscal 2022 (ended Oct. 31, 2022), HP repurchased only $100 million worth of its stock last year, along with $500 million during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Image source: Sirius XM.\n\n4. Sirius XM Holdings: Sold 3,561,146 shares (reduced stake by 8.85%)\n\nOne of the biggest head-scratchers of the first quarter was the decision by Buffett and/or his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to modestly reduce Berkshire's stake in satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI) by close to 9% after building it up over the previous two quarters.\n\nMost radio operators rely heavily on advertising revenue, so those aforementioned indicators that point to possible economic weakness may have coerced this selling. Further, auto sales tend to slow down when the economy weakens. Sirius XM expects promotional customers with new vehicle purchases to become self-pay subscribers. Economic turbulence would slow this process.\n\nDespite these concerns, Sirius XM stock is as cheap as it's ever been as a publicly traded company (about 8.5 times forward-year earnings). Since it generates most of its revenue (78% in the first quarter) from subscriptions and not advertising, it's better positioned than terrestrial and online radio operators to navigate a recession.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that some of its key expenses, such as transmission and equipment, tend to be relatively fixed, which leads to predictable operating cash flow year after year. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price Chart\n\n5. Chevron: Sold 3,113,119 shares (reduced stake by 2.47%)\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha and his investment team also slightly pared down Berkshire's stake in energy giant Chevron(NYSE: CVX) by roughly 2.5%. With Chevron boasting an aggressive $75 billion share repurchase program, this selling activity might simply be to keep its stake in the company fairly constant as the oil and gas titan enacts buybacks.\n\nAlthough energy stocks have, historically, not played a big role in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio, the $19.3 billion currently invested in Chevron makes it Buffett's fifth-largest holding. This looks to be a pretty clear indication that he and his cohorts expect the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated.\n\nFor three years during the COVID-19 pandemic, global energy companies (which includes Chevron) were forced to substantially reduce their capital expenditures (capex) due to demand uncertainty. Even though the worst of the pandemic has passed and capex spending is back to normal, global crude supply constraints remain. That's great news for the spot price of crude, as well as for Chevron's high-margin drilling segment.\n\nDon't forget, Chevron is also an integrated energy company. In addition to drilling for oil and natural gas, it operates transmission pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. These ancillary segments provide predictable cash flow and help to hedge against downside in the price of crude oil.\n\n6. Louisiana-Pacific: Sold 446,962 shares (reduced stake by 6.34%)\n\nThe sixth and final stock Warren Buffett was a seller of during the March-ended quarter is Louisiana-Pacific(NYSE: LPX). This supplier of wood siding products used in new home construction and remodeling had nearly 447,000 shares sold by Berkshire's brightest investment minds.\n\nConsidering Louisiana-Pacific is one of Berkshire's smaller holdings, this selling activity might have more to do with Combs and/or Weschler than Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha's investment lieutenants are far more active than he is on the trading front and frequently lock in gains after a few quarters to a couple of years.\n\nPerhaps the biggest negative for Louisiana-Pacific is rapidly rising interest rates, which have sent mortgage rates soaring. While, on one hand, the company is benefiting from strong new home sales since the inventory of existing homes for sale is depressed, there's the potential for sustainably high mortgage rates to adversely impact the housing market. As long as core inflation (led by shelter inflation) remains stubbornly high, there's not much of a catalyst compelling the Federal Reserve to kick off a rate-easing cycle.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SONY, UBER, CDNS: Which Strong-Buy-Rated Tech Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "Stock markets are on a bit of a pause following concerns that the Federal Reserve may not be ready to cut interest rates until September. Undoubtedly, the odds of a June cut were pretty low to begin with. Either way, a “higher for slightly longer” kind of environment may take a slight stride out of the market’s march higher, even with the artificial intelligence (AI) boom still very much in full swing.\n\nAs the market rally slows pace, the following high-rated tech stocks may be worth loading up on. Therefore, in this piece, we’ll look at three very different technology companies using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool. Each one of the names has a Strong Buy recommendation, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nSony (NYSE:SONY)\n\nSony is a Japanese entertainment company that offers a unique and diversified mix of businesses, ranging from film production to music and video games to electronics. The stock was a major mover going into and after its latest earnings, which came in ahead of analyst expectations. Though not all segments may find themselves firing on all cylinders at the same time, the company remains diversified (and cheap) enough to make it a worthy bet right here. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on SONY stock at just over $80 per share.\n\nFor the latest (fourth) quarter, the entertainment giant reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.99, topping expectations of $0.69. Most remarkably, the Music, Pictures, and Imaging & Sensing Solutions segments all saw impressive double-digit growth for the quarter. Meanwhile, Game & Network Services (G&NS) saw low growth, up 2.2% for the quarter, thanks in part to falling shipments for the PlayStation 5 (PS5).\n\nThe PS5 is a great console but been experiencing a bit of a midlife crisis of late. Indeed, the top-selling console is a major needle mover, not just for the gaming business but the overall firm.\n\nAs the firm readies a Pro model with a new GPU, perhaps the gaming division will finally get the shot in the arm it needs before the PS6 rolls around. The console is rumored to include better ray tracing and AI upscaling, the latter of which could be a literal game changer. Of all the industries AI could propel into the future, gaming has to be close to the top of the list.\n\nThough not truly the PS6, I do view the PS5 Pro as the next best thing to a generational refresh. Whether it kicks off a midcycle refresh remains the big question. Either way, developers are gearing up for the upgrades, which could result in a steady and stacked pipeline of truly next-generation-feeling titles.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the dominant gaming business and the wide-moat film, music, and electronics businesses, I view Sony stock as a fantastic deal at 15.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) now that shares have come down a bit after their big 10% post-earnings pop.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for SONY Stock?\n\nSONY stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with four unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average SONY stock price target of $112.93 implies 39.8% upside potential.\n\nUber (NASDAQ:UBER)\n\nUber stock’s bull run of 2023-24 is now officially over, with shares of the ride-hailing giant now down 22% from their all-time highs. The multi-month fall has been a rather steady descent on the back of some fantastic second-quarter earnings results. Undoubtedly, the hot valuation was in need of a cool-off, but now that shares have chilled out in a bear market, I view them as a great pick-up ahead of the summer travel season. I’m staying bullish on the stock as the bearish descent extends.\n\nAs the travel season heats up, Uber seems to be gearing up to save its customers some money with its shuttle-booking service. Such a service could not have come at a better time. Consumers are a bit strapped for cash amid inflation, and Uber continues to demonstrate the tremendous value proposition of its mobility services. Additionally, the firm’s recent Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) partnership to help power its restaurant delivery capabilities could open Uber’s doors to new customers who may be enticed to give Uber’s app a go as well.\n\nAdd the Uber One subscription, which offers discounts on mobility and food delivery services, plus an expansion to 25 new countries into the equation, and it’s clear that it’s too soon to depart Uber stock while it’s going for a modest 51 times forward P/E, close to the lowest it’s been in the past year.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for UBER Stock?\n\nUBER stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 31 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average UBER stock price target of $88.03 implies 37.3% upside potential.\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS)\n\nCadence Design Systems is picking up speed again after suffering a 15% correction back in April. As the AI boom heats up again, thanks in part to continued explosive demand for AI accelerators, Cadence is one of the high-performing AI plays to watch as it inches back to all-time highs again. Today, the stock is off just 12% from its high, a level that could be breached should Cadence be able to pass an earnings bar that it lowered just over a month ago. All things considered, I’m staying bullish on CDNS stock.\n\nLooking ahead, I’d look for the new Palladium Z3 and Protium X3 systems to jolt growth in the second half of the year. These new products aim to “usher in a new era of accelerated verification, software development, and digital twins.” When you hear “digital twins,” think of the AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), whose technology is integral to powering these sophisticated models.\n\nIn recent quarters, Cadence has formed a closer relationship with Nvidia. The two forces will be ready to launch the Millennium M1 supercomputer, which is every bit as impressive as it sounds. The supercomputer will tackle very difficult problems in science and engineering, providing up to 100x design impact through accuracy, speed, and scale and a 10x increase in throughput compared to CPU-only solutions.\n\nThe stock trades at 49.5 times forward P/E, which is well above the application software industry average of over 30.9 times. Still, I think the premium is well worth paying because of the Z3, X3, and M1 (not to be confused with the first generation of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) silicon).\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for CDNS Stock?\n\nCDNS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average CDNS stock price target of $335.71 implies 16.5% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThere you have it — three analyst-praised technology companies that still have room to boom in the second half of the year. Sony, an entertainment kingpin that’s expanded its reach across numerous media, is objectively the cheapest based on P/E ratios alone. Personally, I view it as the best bet. For those seeking greater growth, though, CDNS stock is tough to beat, given innovations that could move the needle in the coming year. At writing, analysts see the most upside to be had from SONY stock (~40%).\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Plans AI-Based Siri Overhaul to Control Individual App Functions",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to overhaul its Siri virtual assistant with more advanced artificial intelligence, a move that will let users control individual app functions with their voice, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Becomes First Former US President Guilty of Crimes World’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar South Africa Election Results With 29% Voting Districts In Insurers Sink as UnitedHealth Sees ‘Disturbance’ in Medicaid ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump\n\nThe new system will allow Siri to take command of all the features within apps for the first time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative isn’t public. That change required a revamp of Siri’s underlying software using large language models — a core technology behind generative AI — and will be one of the highlights of Apple’s renewed push into AI, they said.\n\nThe upgrade is one piece of the company’s larger AI strategy, which will be unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. Apple is preparing several features, including voice memo transcriptions and summaries, quick recaps of websites and notifications, automated message replies, advanced photo editing, and AI-generated emojis, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nAs part of the rollout, more basic AI tasks will be processed on devices themselves, while more advanced capabilities will be handled via cloud computing. The company also has been forging a deal with OpenAI to integrate the startup’s chatbot and other technology into the iOS operating system, and it remains in talks with Google parent Alphabet Inc. to use its Gemini software in the future. Apple software boss Craig Federighi has told his teams to develop as many new AI features as possible for this year’s operating system updates.\n\nSiri will be a key focus of the WWDC unveiling. The new system will allow the assistant to control and navigate an iPhone or iPad with more precision. That includes being able to open individual documents, moving a note to another folder, sending or deleting an email, opening a particular publication in Apple News, emailing a web link, or even asking the device for a summary of an article.\n\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nToday, Siri is limited mostly to broader commands like playing music playlists, looking up information or controlling smart home appliances. The company also offers what are known as app intents to developers, allowing them to craft ways for Siri to tap individual features. In 2018, Apple launched Siri Shortcuts as well, letting users manually create commands for app features.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new system will go further, using AI to analyze what people are doing on their devices and automatically enable Siri-controlled features. It will be limited to Apple’s own apps at the beginning, with the company planning to support hundreds of different commands.\n\nRead More: Apple Needs to Evolve to Compete in the Artificial Intelligence Era\n\nThe feature is one of Apple’s more complex AI initiatives and isn’t planned for release until as soon as next year, when it will be part of a subsequent update to iOS 18, according to the people. The first version of the new operating system will launch in September, around the same time as the next iPhone models.\n\nAt the start, the new Siri will handle one command at a time, but Apple has plans to to allow users to chain commands together. For example, they could ask Siri to summarize a recorded meeting and then text it to a colleague in one request. Or an iPhone could theoretically be asked to crop a picture and then email it to a friend.\n\nA major component of the new push is a system that will use AI to automatically determine if a function should be handled on the device or via the cloud.\n\nThat has raised some privacy questions. While on-device tasks won’t share personal information, the cloud-based approach will require some user data to be transferred to remote servers. The information will be protected by the so-called Secure Enclave in the high-end Apple Mac chips powering the data centers, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.\n\nRead More: Apple to Power AI Tools With In-House Server Chips This Year\n\nApple will attempt to further reassure customers that their data is private by creating an “intelligence report” that explains how the information is secured. The iPhone maker also won’t build profiles of customers — something it’s criticized Google and Meta Platforms Inc. for doing.\n\nWith the Siri upgrade, Apple is looking to reinvigorate a pioneering product that fell behind competitors’ services. The company first launched Siri in 2011, giving it a head start in voice-based interfaces and AI. But Apple soon lost that lead to Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and the Google Assistant. Then it was caught flat-footed again when generative AI chatbots emerged two years ago.\n\nApple also is contending with a sales slowdown, and its shares have underperformed those of peers this year. The stock is down about 1% in 2024, compared with a 10% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index. Apple was up 0.5% to $191.29 in New York on Thursday.\n\nApple is betting that the new AI features for the iPhone, iPad and Mac — as well as the Siri enhancements — will encourage users to upgrade their devices. Many of the on-device AI capabilities will require an iPhone 15 Pro or later to work. Macs and iPads, meanwhile, will need at least an M1 chip.\n\n(Updates with shares in second-to-last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos The Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novo’s Race to Boost Supplies Israel’s Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another ‘Lost Decade’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav is leaning on the company's other sports assets as it remains at risk of losing a key media rights deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\n\"We continue to talk to the NBA,\" Zaslav said while speaking at a Bernstein conference on Thursday. \"We love our experience with the NBA. But in general, we're a leader in sports... [with] a full buffet of content around the world.\"\n\nThe executive touted the company's Olympics coverage win in Europe, along with the recent additions of NHL games, Nascar races and college football in the US.\n\n\"This is what we do for a living,\" he said. \"We're in the business of sport, and in sport, the deals come up [and] you make a decision about the overall quality of the full menu of content you have for each of your platforms.\" DALLAS, TEXAS - MAY 28: Luka Doncic #77 of the Dallas Mavericks handles the ball against the Minnesota Timberwolves during the first quarter in Game Four of the Western Conference Finals at American Airlines Center on May 28, 2024 in Dallas, Texas.

(Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images) (Matthew Stockman via Getty Images)\n\nThe NBA's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network and Disney's ESPN (DIS) expires at the end of next season, and rumors have swirled in recent weeks that WBD could lose the media rights to its portion of games to Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). Amazon (AMZN) is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through its Prime Video service.\n\nWall Street analysts have said that possibility would have lasting consequences for the embattled media giant.\n\n\"Losing NBA rights would be a big negative for WBD,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen said in a note published earlier this month. \"While the cost savings may help earnings, we think sports content is key both for linear TV ad sales and carriage fees, and for the Max streaming service's prospects in a competitive direct-to-consumer landscape, especially as it prepares to join the sports streaming [joint venture] with Disney and Fox.\"\n\nSports rights have become increasingly important for legacy media players as more consumers cut the cord. The content is viewed as \"sticky,\" meaning loyal audiences are more willing to fork over their monthly cable package or streaming service fee to access sports over many other types of content.\n\nBut the field has become more competitive, with tech giants like Amazon, Apple (AAPL), and YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL) committing more heavily to sports streaming deals over the past year. That's inflated the overall costs of sports as traditional media giants struggle to keep up.\n\nWarner Bros. currently shells out a reported $1.2 billion annually for the NBA rights. Disney, the NBA's other major broadcast partner, has agreed to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion in order to renew its deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nStory continues\n\nA separate report from the Sports Business Journal suggests Disney's total pay package is closer to $2.8 billion. Amazon's deal is said to be worth between $1.8 billion and $2 billion.\n\nNotably, WBD has the ability to match third-party offers before the NBA enters into any agreements.\n\nLast week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver briefly addressed the negotiations, telling TMZ: \"We’re all still talking. Who knows how it’s going to work out?”\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

He explained that Wall Street is skeptical of Nvidia’s rapid rise, as many need to familiarize themselves with its products.\n\nCramer compared Nvidia’s ascent to Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) dethroning of Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), noting that Nvidia’s fame primarily comes from the enterprise sector and hard-core gamers, CNBC reports.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Expands Partnership with Samsung, New 3nm Chips to Boost Market Share\n\nCramer emphasized that Nvidia’s significance extends beyond gaming.

        "content": "If you’re interested in Warren Buffett stocks to buy, there might be a Canadian target in the future.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NTSE:BRK.B) finally revealed on May 16 that it bought nearly 26 million shares of Chubb (NYSE:CB), a Swiss-based company that provides various types of coverage, including property and casualty and life insurance.\n\nBuffett made it clear that Berkshire has no problem investing in Canadian businesses. Buffett confirmed that it is currently looking at a specific company, although he wouldn’t say what it is.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“There’s a lot of countries we don’t understand at all,” Buffett said. “So, Canada, it’s terrific when you’ve got a major economy, not the size of the U.S., but a major economy that you feel confident about operating there.”\n\nAs a Canadian, I’m always interested when someone of Buffett’s reputation pokes around for a good investment north of the border.\n\nHere are the three names he might be looking at.\n\nConstellation Software (CNSWF) An image of a robot reaching toward a laptop, surrounded by chat bubbles and graphs\n\nSource: klyaksun/Shutterstock\n\nIf you’re as big as Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, you’re likely buying TSX 60 stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange, not over the counter. However, many U.S. retail investors might not have access through their broker, so I’ve listed all three with their OTC stock symbols.\n\nFirst up is Constellation Software (OTCMKTS:CNSWF), a Toronto-based company.\n\n“Constellation Software is an international provider of market-leading software and services to a number of industries. Our mission is to acquire, manage and build market-leading software businesses that develop specialized, mission-critical software solutions to address the specific needs of our particular industries,” Constellation’s investor relations website states.\n\nOn the one hand, Berkshire doesn’t own tech stocks except for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), which suggests Berkshire isn’t looking at a big investment in Constellation.\n\nOn the other hand, Constellation was founded in 1995 by Mark Leonard, who still runs the company after nearly 30 years. Over the years, it has bought hundreds of software companies. If ever there was a business to invest in to gain tech expertise, this would be it.\n\nConstellation is the 12th-largest stock in the TSX 60 by market capitalization at 78.9 billion Canadian dollars ($57.9 billion). Working against it being “the one” is the fact it trades at 100x its earnings over the past 12 months.\n\nAlimentation Couche-Tard (ANCTF) A blurred image of the inside of a convenience store.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlimentation Couche-Tard (OTCMKTS:ANCTF) Is one of the world’s leading convenience store operators. Since its founding in 1980 with one convenience store in Laval, Quebec, it’s grown to 16,715 stores worldwide, including 7,153 in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs you might be aware, Berkshire now owns 100% of Pilot Travel Centers. It acquired 38.6% of the travel center network in 2017, another 41.4% in January 2023, and the final 20% in January.\n\nWhile I’m sure there are nuances between traditional convenience stores/gas stations and travel centers, which also cater to truck drivers and other travelers, a good operator in one area would likely be good in the other.\n\nCouche-Tard, as it’s known, is one of the best operators in the business. It’s run by an American CEO, Brian Hannasch.\n\nCurrently, it generates 66% of its revenue and 71% of its gross profit in the U.S., so it’s already quite American.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, 11 of the 12 analysts covering its stock rated it a Buy.\n\nIntact Financial (IFCZF) miniature home next to pen, pad of paper, calculator and coins on a desk\n\nSource: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntact Financial (OTCMKTS:IFCZF) is the 25th-largest TSX 60 stock with a market cap of 40.8 billion Canadian dollars ($29.9 billion).\n\nIntact is Canada’s largest provider of property and casualty insurance, with a 20% market share. It also operates a UK and Ireland business with RSA Insurance. It has grown organically and through acquisitions—it has made 18 since 1988—to annual premiums of 22 billion Canadian dollars ($16.1 billion).\n\nIn 2023, it generated 67% of its revenue in Canada, 20% in the UK and Ireland, and 13% in the U.S. In terms of its lines of business, personal Lines accounted for 46%, commercial lines (26%), and specialty lines (28%).\n\nOver the past 15 years, it’s increased its direct premiums written five-fold, while its share price has risen 700% over the same period.\n\nIn the years ahead, its focus is on continuing to grow its leadership position in Canada, becoming a bigger player in the UK and Ireland, and building a substantial specialty lines business.\n\nAs long as CEO Charles Brindamour is leading the charge—he’s been CEO since January 2008—Warren Buffett should absolutely be interested in Intact.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite Canadian companies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Double Delight- 3 Tech Stocks Delivering Dividends and Growth",
        "content": "The tech industry is a hot space right now. Investors are watching the segment with keen interest, and it is understandable why there is so much attention on the space. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is grabbing headlines, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has set a record. Those who missed out on holding Nvidia are now on the lookout for tech dividend stocks that could show a similar rally. AI has become a part of several industries and is indispensable today.\n\nThe earnings season shows the importance of AI, and while Nvidia is wearing the crown right now, several other tech companies have been steadily growing. If you are a passive income investor and want the best of both dividends and growth, here are three tech stocks with strong upside potential and steady dividend payouts. Let’s take a look at these companies have a strong industry presence and a record of delivering dividends.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustry favorite Taiwan SemiconductorManufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is an undervalued stock. Trading at $159, it is up 57% year-to-date (YTD) and 315% in the past five years. As the demand for chips continues to grow, TSM is set to benefit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is the world’s largest chip maker and produces chips for companies including Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It holds 60% of the market share in the foundry industry and 85% of the market share in the AI chip industry.\n\nA leader in the industry, TSM will benefit as Nvidia grows. Both companies have a close connection, and with the soaring demand for AI chips, TSM is set to expand. The company is struggling in the smartphone segment while thriving in the AI chip market. It will have to find a balance so that the drop in smartphone segment revenue does not impact the business as a whole.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter results, TSM beat analyst estimates and reported revenue of $19.62 billion. It aims to begin mass production of 4-nanometer (nm) chips at its new Arizona plant in 2025.\n\nTSM enjoys a dividend yield of 1.52%, and the payout ratio stands at 33% of the earnings. This shows there is a potential to increase dividends in the coming years.\n\nWhile TSM stock hasn’t had a rally like Nvidia, there is a lot of upside potential from here. The demand is going to remain strong, and as a dominant chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is set to benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been writing about Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for a while now, and am impressed with the way the business is expanding. A global software company, Oracle has been in the industry for many years and is taking on AI demand with the right products. The company is building 100 new data centers and has signed noteworthy partnerships which will strengthen its market position.\n\nBesides partnering with Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) and Nvidia, Oracle has recently deepened its 30-year association with Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and will continue to offer generative AI solutions. Both companies aim to help businesses with data analysis.\n\nTrading at $124, ORCL stock is up 19% YTD and soared 6% in the past month. Investors who believe that the future is AI should start accumulating ORCL stock. The company impressed the market in third-quarter results that featured strong financials. The revenue hit $13.3 billion, up 7% while the cloud services segment was up 25% and reported revenue of $5.1 billion. An important metric, the remaining performance obligations hit $80 billion, up 29% year over year (YOY).\n\nOracle is a fundamentally stable company with a strong history. It enjoys a dividend yield of 1.29% and has increased dividends for 14 consecutive years. Oracle is a stock to buy and hold for the next decade. Its AI investments will drive growth in the coming years.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) cisco (CSCO) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a dividend yield of 3.46%, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an ideal choice for dividend investors. The company is a hidden gem that does not get the attention it deserves.\n\nTrading at $46, the stock is down 8% YTD and has been moving sideways over the past few months. The company is working on enhancing its AI offerings. While it is a little behind in the AI race, it is very much a part of the race.\n\nIt reported revenue of $12.7 billion, down 13% YOY in the third quarter, and earnings per share (EPS) came in at 88 cents. Net income dropped 41% and management believes it was because of existing users setting up the equipment they received. The management enhanced its outlook with revenue guidance in the range of $53.6 billion to $53.8 billion.\n\nCisco has increased dividends for 13 consecutive years, and with the product order trends looking up, I believe it has the potential to increase the dividends in the coming years.\n\nInvestors aren’t happy with the results or the guidance but I believe the AI investments will pay off in the long term. The stock looks cheap to me and is a good choice for those looking to make money from dividends while the stock grows. Cisco stock isn’t going to show any immediate upside and it isn’t risk-free but if you are in it for the dividends, it is worth a bet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "NIO Stock’s Battery Swapping Bet: A Gamble That Might Not Pay Off for Investors",
        "content": "Two key attributes that I often look for in companies when deciding whether to invest in them are points of differentiation and competitive advantages. Points of differentiation distinguish companies from their competitors. Some of these points result in competitive advantages that enable firms to gain market share. Ultimately, market share gains frequently result in higher profits. Finally, stock prices usually rise because of higher profits.\n\nBoth Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made products that consumers viewed as much more attractive than those of their competitors. That was their main point of differentiation. It became a huge competitive advantage for both of them, enabling them to gain market share and tremendously boost their profits.\n\nWhile Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NASDAQ:NIO) has its own key point of differentiation, the evidence suggests it’s not yet a competitive advantage for the firm. I’m unsure if that situation will change in the future. Moreover, Nio is facing very stiff competition and its recent growth metrics have been quite unimpressive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven these points, I recommend investors sell NIO stock.\n\nNio’s Key Point of Differentiation\n\nNio’s key point 0f differentiation is its extensive battery-swapping network. With battery swapping, EV drivers can exchange their used batteries for new, full batteries at specified locations.\n\nI’ve always believed that battery swapping would make driving EVs much more attractive for consumers. That’s because, in a short period of time (three minutes, according to Nio), battery swapping would allow EV drivers to go from having very little driving range to having hundreds of miles available again. As a result, the system, if implemented on a broad scale, could largely eliminate both the “range anxiety” issue and the need to wait a long time before EVs are mostly or fully charged.\n\nBut history strongly suggests that my faith in the power of battery swapping was misplaced. Nio said in March that it had carried out 40 million battery swaps yet the firm is still losing a great deal of money. It is also far from being one of China’s leading EV makers. For example, the automaker handed over slightly more than 160,000 vehicles in 2023, while its rival BYD (OTC:BYDDF) delivered a bit more than 3 million vehicles last year. What’s more, Nio lost nearly $2.8 billion last year.\n\nMoreover, an Israeli startup called Better Space focused on battery swapping about 10 years ago and suffered “massive losses.” It eventually disappeared.\n\nStory continues\n\nCould Battery Swapping Eventually Be a Competitive Advantage for NIO Stock?\n\nIn November 2023, Nio began partnering with several other Chinese automakers on “developing battery swap standards and expanding the network in China,” CNBC reported.\n\nBy working with other automakers, Nio will be able to foster the creation of a huge battery-swapping ecosystem and spread the word about the service more effectively. On the other hand, if more automakers offer the service, Nio’s point of differentiation and competitive advantage become greatly diluted.\n\nFurther, automakers and battery makers are developing EV batteries that can be charged relatively quickly. For example, Tesla’s superchargers allow 200 miles of range to be added to vehicles’ batteries in just 15 minutes. And Israeli startup StoreDotsays that the range of its batteries can be increased by 70 percentage points in only 10 minutes.\n\nOver the longer term, these and other advances in EV batteries may make battery-swapping services less attractive.\n\nNio’s Tough Competition and Unimpressive Growth\n\nNio is facing an array of very tough competitors in the Chinese EV market. In addition to Tesla and BYD, Nio has to contend with many Western giants whose vehicles are generally very popular in the Asian country. Among the names in the latter category are General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (OTC:VLKAF).\n\nAnd there are indications that Nio is faltering amid the tough conditions. For example, in Q4 of 2023, its revenue from EV sales increased just 4.6% versus the same period a year earlier. Its operating loss only fell by 4% during the quarter versus the same period a year earlier to a very steep $933 million.\n\nThe Bottom Line on NIO Stock\n\nNIO stock has a low price-to-sales ratio of one. Still, given the uncertain value of the company’s only apparent point of differentiation and its uninspiring growth. I advise investors to sell the shares at this time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks That Look Even Better After Q1 Earnings",
        "content": "Dividend payments offer many benefits to investors. In fact, 75% of the returns in the S&P 500 between 1980 and 2019 came from dividends, according to market data. Dividend payments are currently at an all-time high. The Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index just released data showing that dividend payments from publicly traded U.S. companies hit a record $164.3 billion in this year’s first quarter, up 7% from a year earlier.\n\nBlue-chip companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) each raised their dividend payments this year. At the same time, other company’s such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced their first-ever dividend payouts. Janus Henderson said that it expects global dividend payments to rise 5% by year’s end and reach a record of $1.72 trillion for all of 2024.\n\nClearly companies are recognizing the importance of returning a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividend payments. Here are three dividend stocks to buy that look even better after Q1 earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM), the company behind Post-it notes, saw its stock rise 7% after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter financial results. For Q1, 3M announced EPS of $2.39 and revenues of $7.7 billion. Analysts had been looking for a profit of $2.10 a share and revenue of $7.6 billion. The latest results included numbers for the recently spun off healthcare business, Solventum (NYSE:SOLV), which became its own publicly traded company on April 1 of this year.\n\nIn addition to the Solventum spinoff, 3M finalized two major legal settlements, agreeing to pay $10.3 billion to address chemical spills in drinking water and $6 billion to resolve lawsuits related to its military earplugs. The company also replaced longtime CEO Mike Roman on May 1 with Bill Brown as the new head of 3M. This brings us to the dividend. 3M recently cut it by 54%. However, that was less than feared and it still leaves the company with a quarterly payout that yields nearly 3%, which is better than most stocks.\n\nOver the past 12 months, MMM stock has risen 23%.\n\nMacy’s (M) Macy's (M) logo on storefront in city with white sky behind\n\nSource: Joe Tabacca / Shutterstock.com\n\nMacy’s (NYSE:M) recently reported a Q1 profit that topped Wall Street forecasts as the retailer’s turnaround strategy gathers momentum. The department store chain reported EPS of 27 cents versus 15 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $4.85 billion, narrowly missing the $4.86 billion that was the consensus forecast on Wall Street. The company is undertaking an aggressive turnaround strategy as it tries to grow sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year, Macy’s announced plans to close 150 of its outlets, more than 25% of its namesake locations. However, the company plans to open more Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury stores, as well as smaller Macy’s stores located in suburban strip malls. In its earnings release, Macy’s said that it “views 2024 as a transition and investment year.”\n\nAs for its dividend, Macy’s pays a quarterly distribution to stockholders of 17 cents per share, giving M stock a strong yield of 3.38%. Macy’s share price has increased 46% in the last 12 months.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola ko stock\n\nSource: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs is almost always the case, beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported Q1 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines. The company said it continues to benefit from price increases in the current inflationary environment. Coke announced EPS of 72 cents versus 70 cents that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue amounted to $11.30 billion compared to forecasts of $11.01 billion. Sales were up 11% from a year ago.\n\nEarlier this year, Coca-Cola raised its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 5.4%. The company now pays stockholders a quarterly dividend of 48.5 cents per share, up from 46 cents previously. The dividend yield on KO stock is at 3.15% based on the current share price. Another reason for Coke to be one of the dividend stocks to buy is this marks 62 consecutive years that Coke has increased its dividend payment. Among a select group of companies known as “dividend kings,” Coke has boosted their payouts for 50 years or more.\n\nKO stock has gained 3% over the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Most Prosperous Nation in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will be finding out the most prosperous nations in the world. Based on weighted averages of GDP per Capita and Gini coefficient, we’ve prepared a list of 40 Most Prosperous Nations in the World.\n\nGlobal poverty saw a major increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic as extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) rose from 8.9% in 2019 to 9.7% in 2020. This was the first global increase in decades. South Asia witnessed the highest rise, with extreme poverty jumping by 2.4 percentage points to 13%. However, regions like Latin America and the Caribbean, bolstered by Brazil’s fiscal policies, saw a decline in extreme poverty despite the pandemic’s economic disruptions.\n\nBy 2022, many regions, including East Asia, Latin America, and Europe, had reduced their extreme poverty rates below pre-pandemic levels. Despite this, global poverty remained marginally above 2019 levels. The uneven recovery is evident in Sub-Saharan Africa, where over half of the world's extremely poor reside, and poverty reduction was slower due to limited survey coverage and the compounded impact of inflation driven by geopolitical events like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2024, the state of global prosperity is definitely improving, as there has been significant growth in the number of people living in better conditions (relatively). In June 2023, the World Bank established a new threshold for prosperity at $25 a day, or $9,125 annually. Currently, around 2.4 billion people, nearly a third of the global population, live at or above this level. This figure is increasing rapidly as approximately 85 million people cross this threshold annually. However, considering global population growth, the net increase in prosperous individuals is around 15 million annually.\n\nMoreover, since 2021, more people in emerging economies have achieved prosperity compared to those in the OECD countries, although only 20% of the population in these regions meets the prosperity threshold compared to 82% in OECD countries. By 2033, the spending power of the prosperous in emerging economies is expected to surpass that of the OECD.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that those earning $25 a day spend about $13.50 on essentials like food, housing, and clothing, leaving $11.50 for discretionary spending on goods and services that enhance quality of life. This contrasts sharply with the spending habits of those below the prosperity line, who allocate the majority of their income to basic necessities.\n\nAnother concern regarding economic prosperity is the vulnerability of women to the issue. Currently, one in every ten women worldwide lives in extreme poverty. Conflict exacerbates these conditions, as seen by the doubling of women and girls in conflict-affected areas since 2017, now numbering over 614 million. In these regions, women are 7.7 times more likely to live in extreme poverty compared to men. Climate change further deepens economic inequalities for women. By 2030, it is projected that 236 million more women and girls will face hunger, compared to 131 million men.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, some tech giants like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been active in ensuring economic prosperity for nations around the world.\n\nFor example, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has made a major contribution to economic prosperity through its recent $1 billion digital ecosystem initiative in Kenya, in collaboration with G42. This investment is the largest private-sector digital investment in Kenya’s history and aims to boost economic development across East Africa by establishing a state-of-the-art green data center and creating a new East Africa Cloud Region. Additionally, the initiative includes local-language AI development, digital skills training, and improved connectivity to enhance Kenya's technological landscape and workforce capabilities.\n\nSpeaking of initiatives, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also investing $2.9 billion over the next two years to enhance Japan's AI and cloud infrastructure. The investment will include AI training for 3 million people, opening Japan’s first Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Research Asia lab in Tokyo, and strengthening cybersecurity collaboration with Japan’s government.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has recently opened its first Developer Center in Southeast Asia, located in Singapore which is no less than a milestone for the region’s tech industry and its prosperity. This state-of-the-art facility offers unparalleled access to Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) experts and resources that will benefit hundreds of thousands of developers behind more than 90,000 apps on the App Store.\n\nThis Developer Center will certainly drive economic prosperity in Asia by fostering innovation and enhancing the skill sets of local developers. The centre provides a range of activities, such as sessions, labs, and workshops designed for teams at all stages of app development. With access to over 250,000 APIs and more than 40 software development kits (SDKs), developers can integrate advanced technologies like machine learning and augmented reality into their apps. This focus on upskilling will not only advance individual careers but also attract international companies to the region. The Most Prosperous Nation in the World\n\nIs Norway the Most Prosperous Nation in the World?\n\nIn order to identify the most prosperous nation in the world, we used two primary metrics: GDP per capita by country (as of 2022) and the Gini Coefficient Index. Data for both metrics was sourced from the World Bank. Each metric was ranked from 1 to 200, with 1 being the highest rank.\n\nWe assigned weights to the ranks of each metric: GDP per capita was given a weight of 0.8, and the Gini Coefficient was given a weight of 0.2. We then calculated a weighted average of the ranks for each country. Based on these weighted averages, we determined the overall ranks of the countries.\n\nThe idea behind our methodology is that GDP per Capita explains the average economic output and standard of living which can provide a clear measure of national wealth of any country. On the other hand, the Gini Coefficient Index assesses income inequality which helps determine how evenly this wealth is distributed among the population. Together, these metrics provide a holistic view of prosperity. Our methodology revealed that Norway is indeed the most prosperous nation in the world with an weighted average rank of 4.8.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that In Norway, the mainland GDP is projected to grow by 1.0% in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025. Unemployment is expected to stabilize around 2%, while annual wage growth for 2024 is estimated at 5.2%. Although inflation will decrease, it will remain above the 2% target, averaging 4.0% in 2024 and 3.5% in 2025. The policy rate is likely to stay at 4.5% through 2024, with potential cuts expected in 2025. Increased household purchasing power and higher housing prices will support economic growth despite ongoing challenges with the NOK.\n\nNorway has a high GDP per capita of $121,259 as of 2022 and has a low Gini coefficient of 0.277, making it the most prosperous country in the world.\n\nTo check out other prosperous nations in the world, please visit the 40 Most Prosperous Nations in the World and read our full report.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best online ESL courses to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "A court in Shanghai rejected a Chinese consumer's claim that Apple was abusing its market dominance with high iOS App Store fees, marking a win for the US technology giant as it faces increased antitrust scrutiny around the world.\n\nWhile Apple has the dominant market position in terms of iOS app distribution in mainland China, it did not abuse that power and has not charged unfairly high commission fees, according to a judgment made on Wednesday by the Shanghai Intellectual Property Court.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2021 by an individual named Jin Xin, who claimed to have had to pay more for some app membership fees on an iPhone than on Android phones because of the 30 per cent commission Apple charges app developers.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Shanghai court said that after comparing commission fees on app stores, it did not find Apple's to be \"significantly higher\" than those on Android platforms, and that there is no evidence suggesting that the fees directly led to higher prices for consumers, according to its yet to be published judgment obtained by the South China Morning Post.\n\nPeople walk past an Apple store in Shanghai, China September 13, 2023. Photo: Reuters alt=People walk past an Apple store in Shanghai, China September 13, 2023. Photo: Reuters>\n\nApple's App Store practices have long been the subject of complaints from app makers, and have recently drawn intensified antitrust scrutiny from global regulators.\n\nThe European Commission last month fined Apple more than €1.8 billion (US$1.95 billion) for preventing music app developers from informing iOS users of alternative subscription offers available outside their iOS apps, saying that the company had abused its dominant position.\n\nIn March, the US Department of Justice sued Apple for a range of practices, including blocking non-iOS apps and barring so-called super apps, accusations that Apple said were \"wrong on the facts and the law\", and that it would \"vigorously defend against it\".\n\nThe Shanghai court's judgment marks a victory for Apple, which has been facing increasing headwinds in the country amid intense competition from domestic handset makers such as Huawei Technologies. Apple earlier this month offered consumers in mainland China discounts of up to 23 per cent on iPhone 15 models purchased through online retailers to boost sluggish sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a blog post published on social media platform WeChat, a legal representative for the plaintiff Jin in the Shanghai case wrote that they plan to file an appeal to China's Supreme People's Court.\n\nCustomers look at the new iPhone 15 Pro at an Apple store in Shanghai, China September 22, 2023.

        "content": "Sometimes politicians seem to have an uncanny ability to beat the market. In recognition of this, many investors outside of the Beltway pay particular attention to the trades of our senators and representatives -- like those of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.\n\nLast week, Greene submitted a regulatory filing that revealed six recent stock purchases: AdvancedMicroDevices(NASDAQ: AMD), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Caterpillar(NYSE: CAT), CharlesSchwab(NYSE: SCHW), KinderMorgan(NYSE: KMI), and SouthernCompany(NYSE: SO). It's not clear how much Greene invested in each of the stocks, though each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Greene sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee as well as the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nWhat to know about Greene's recent purchases\n\nWhile Greene hasn't provided an explanation regarding the motivation behind her recent stock purchases, there are some likely reasons why she clicked the buy button on some of these names. For one, Advanced Micro Devices and Apple are leading tech stocks that provide exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) -- something that's red-hot right now.\n\nSemiconductor stock AMD is making a greater push into AI with its new graphic processing units (GPUs), an area where Nvidia is currently the reigning champion. Apple is attempting to broaden its AI reach in several ways, including its development of a new system for advancing large language models called ReALM that could greatly enhance Siri's functionality.\n\nThree infrastructure stocks also found their way onto Greene's buy screen. There are a couple of reasons why she may have been motivated to acquire these familiar names. For one, many projects are taking shape in response to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was passed in 2021. This will provide a strong tailwind for heavy machinery equipment powerhouse Caterpillar over the next few years. The company reported a $400 million quarter-over-quarter increase in its backlog during its first-quarter 2024 financial results presentation. Also, Caterpillar has demonstrated a long-running commitment to shareholders. After hiking its dividend for the past 30 consecutive years, Caterpillar also began a $3.5 billion share buyback plan.\n\nAs a leading pipeline stock, Kinder Morgan is also poised for growth from infrastructure spending. The company projects natural gas demand will grow about 19% from 2023 through 2030, and it has about $2.5 billion in natural gas projects in its backlog -- an figure that it expects to continue growing. Like Caterpillar, Kinder Morgan is also a compelling income stock, offering a 5.8% forward dividend yielding.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthern Company stands as yet another infrastructure stock that Greene is relying on to help build a better portfolio. A familiar name to the representative from Georgia, the utility is headquartered in Atlanta. Recently commencing operations at its new nuclear power plant Plant Vogtle Unit 3, Southern Company provides electric service in the Southeast and natural gas service to 4.4 million customers in 10 states. For 77 straight years, Southern Company has paid a dividend, raising it for the last 23 consecutive years.\n\nRetail brokerage heavyweight Charles Schwab rounds out Greene's latest buys. Coming off a strong start to 2024, the financial stock provides Greene with some diversification, and it also provides more passive income, offering a 1.3% forward-yielding dividend.\n\nShould you mimic Greene's buys?\n\nWhile it's a worthwhile exercise to check in and see what stocks politicians are adding to their holdings, it's foolhardy to blindly follow their stock picks. There are certainly bull cases to be made for all of the stocks that Greene recently bought, but there are also skeptics who can present bear cases for the stocks. Consequently, investors must do their own due diligence and decide if the individual stocks are right for them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,878!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Country with the Most Inventions in All Human History",
        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the country with the most inventions in all human history. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 20 Countries with the Most Inventions in All Human History.\n\nNumerous inventions have shaped our modern lifestyle, transforming our outlook on the world and how we spend our time. Innovation allows businesses to create unique products and services that differentiate them from their competitors. More than 80% of digitally advanced companies identify innovation as one of their main strengths.\n\nCompanies that consistently innovate to understand and meet customer needs excel at attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Around 65% of rapidly growing companies report working with their customers on potential innovations.\n\nDisruptive innovation transforms an industry by creating a new value market, ultimately displacing an existing one. A prime example of this is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Initially, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) operated a DVD-by-mail service. However, the game changed when the company shifted to online streaming. This move revolutionized how people consume media, moving away from traditional DVD rentals.\n\nThe video streaming market is currently valued at approximately $105.09 billion. It is projected to grow significantly, reaching an estimated $303.05 billion in the next five years, illustrating the impact of disruptive innovation. This growth represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.59% over the forecast period between 2024 and 2029.\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) is another American multinational company known for its investments in research and development. In 1925, AT&T (NYSE:T) established a groundbreaking research and development division known as Bell Telephone Laboratories, widely recognized as Bell Labs. This division became known for its significant contributions, such as advancements in radio astronomy, the invention of the transistor, and the development of the photovoltaic cell.\n\nAnother prime example of a company supporting innovation is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of the iPhone in 2007 is a classic case of radical innovation. At the time, the iPhone merged three unique products: a mobile phone, a touch-screen iPod, and a portable device for email, navigation, and web browsing. Today, over 120 million Americans own an iPhone, highlighting its lasting impact.\n\nResearch and development expenses for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have consistently increased each year since 2013, totaling just over $175 billion by the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024. A significant portion of these growing R&D expenses is aimed at maintaining the company’s leadership in the smartphone market. Since incorporating 5G wireless technology into its flagship iPhone in late 2020, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its share of the domestic smartphone market soar to over 50%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s what Polen Capital said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance during the first quarter were SAP, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) (not owned), and Amazon. The zero weight to Apple was another notable relative contributor in the quarter. More recently, Apple has come under pressure from a confluence of issues ranging from a weak iPhone cycle, market share erosion in China, mounting regulatory pressureb around App Store fees in Europe, and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department accusing the company of anticompetitive practices in its iPhone business. All this has resulted in the stock down -11% year to date, underperforming the overall Index by -19%—Apple’s worst relative performance quarter since 2013. It remains a great business and one we follow, but we’re content not owning it right now, given its growth prospects relative to its valuation.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 20 countries with the most inventions throughout history, we consulted reputable sources, including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Fortune, Insead, and Insider Monkey. As comprehensive historical data on all inventions is not readily available, we relied on these sources to identify the countries with the greatest number of inventions. We then used data from WIPO to analyze the innovation index and the number of patents for each shortlisted country. Many of the countries that were highly innovative in the 18th and 19th centuries have continued to invest heavily in research and development. Therefore, our ranking is based on the total number of patent grants by applicants' origin from 1980 to 2022, reflecting both historical and ongoing innovation efforts.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Country with the Most Inventions in All Human History\n\n1. Japan\n\nTotal Patent Grants = 7,561,395\n\nJapan currently holds the highest number of total patent grants. Japanese innovation focuses on precision and efficiency. The bullet train, or Shinkansen, is a prime example, offering high-speed and reliable transportation. Japan is also one of the countries with the most inventions per capita.\n\nDiscover which country secured the second spot.

        "title": "Evercore ISI: Nvidia is no longer 'the stock that is the market'",
        "content": "Evercore ISI argued in a Wednesday note to clients that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is no longer the linchpin of the stock market, despite its remarkable post-earnings rally.\n\nFollowing Nvidia's earnings report on May 22, the AI stock surged nearly 20% in three days, a move that historically would have lifted the S&P 500. However, this time the S&P 500 remained down, marking an unprecedented decoupling.\n\n“While there have been several instances of “important” stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) or NVDA rising 20% in 3 days, either the shares were not yet a top 5 weight stock in the S&P 500 or those rallies moved the S&P 500 higher in tandem,” Evercore analysts wrote.\n\n“SPX never down simultaneous to a 20%+ advance after an Earnings release,” they added.\n\nThe divergence is particularly striking given Nvidia's high correlation with the S&P 500, which stood at 0.95 over the past year, and happening on May 28, when the implied correlation among large-cap stocks tumbled to 12.04, among the lowest in history.\n\nThis, according to Evercore, further reinforces the notion of a \"stockpicker's market.\" Historically, such troughs in correlation have led to significant market corrections, yet the recent period has been an exception.\n\nThe 3-day surge of NVDA while the S&P 500 fell “is a catalyst for greater movement at the S&P 500 level ahead of other event catalysts,” continued Evercore analysts. These catalysts include the upcoming Trump trial verdict, core PCE inflation report, Nvidia’s stock split, CPI report, and the FOMC meeting next month.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvercore ISI: Nvidia is no longer 'the stock that is the market'\n\nHow China's EV makers aim to beat Tesla, legacy automakers in Europe\n\nEuropean stocks largely lower; key inflation data looms\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Five Broad Technology ETFs To Keep On Your Radar In 2024",
        "content": "Major U.S. indices are coming off a strong performance quarter following surging gains of large-cap technology stocks fueling the bull market. Despite the slight drawback in recent weeks, Wall Street analysts are positive that there’s still enough steam left in the engines before indices could experience a retraction.\n\nTech Holding Steady\n\nOn Monday, May 20 indices across the market were pursuing new records as the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.65%, reaching an intra-day record high of 16,794.87. The broader S&P 500 furthered its winning streak, gaining 0.09% and ending the trading day at 5,309.13.\n\nOn Wall Street, all eyes were on the Dow Jones Industrial Average which had caught investors off guard following its breakout performance on Friday, May 17. The Dow ended the trading day above 40,000, a new record for the 30-stock index and the first time in its nearly 128-year history.\n\nAfter the weekend, however, the Dow Jones slightly retreated, falling 196.82 points on May 20, and closing off at 39,806.77.\n\nThough retraction levels are somewhat superficial at this time, investors are hot on the heels of large-cap technology stocks and companies that are expected to begin delivering earnings results in the following weeks.\n\nThe next couple of weeks are set to be yet another eventful time on the stock market as major players such as AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are expected to deliver earnings. Company stocks gained 2% on May 20, as investors and analysts raised their pricing positions ahead of its earnings report.\n\nNvidia continues to push beyond the glass ceiling, with stocks up more than 96% since the turn of the year and already gaining more than 206% in the last 12 months. The tech and chip titan is now the third-largest on the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion.\n\nThough elsewhere, broader economic performance continues to remain volatile despite U.S. inflation trending downwards and domestic demand for products and services cools. Inflation data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% in April with CPI rising 3.4% year on year, Reuters reported.\n\nSticky inflation and wage growth have left the Federal Reserve’s decision unchanged about cutting interest rates any time soon, with the federal fund rate still sitting at 5.25% to 5.5%. A potential rate cut is expected near the end of summer, as the central bank continues to gauge inflation, employment, and wage growth as key decision-makers before losing their monetary policy. 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nNew York Wall Street sign.\n\nLooking Towards Diversifying\n\nThe overactive market conditions are bringing new and old investors to consider other possibilities that could provide them with broader diversification in the tech sector. As the competition among large-cap companies continues to swell, those looking to hold a safer position could instead be looking at tech exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an opportunity to gain market share and further diversify their holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroad tech ETFs are a corner of the market that has received major attention in recent years, with holdings in companies that are directly involved in the technology industry, including networking, software, hardware, semiconductors, social media, search engine marketing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nHere’s a breakdown of five broad tech ETFs to keep on your radar this year.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF\n\n5G connectivity is taking off at full speed despite being only in the beginning stages of its lifecycle. An Ericsson Mobility Report found that more than 1.6 billion 5G smartphone subscriptions were active by the end of 2023 with a projected two billion to be active by the end of this year.\n\nThe exceptional growth of the market has meant that mobile service providers are quickly catching wind of these developments and looking to leverage larger market opportunities in the coming years.\n\nDefiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF (FIVG) shows that 5G technology and connectivity aren’t only essential for everyday communication but instead provide a stable investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their portfolios into this seemingly untapped market.\n\nThe fund has roughly 53 holdings, offering investors transparent exposure to 5G stocks and companies engaged in connectivity services, development, research, and commercialization. The underlying index tracks 48 globally-listed stocks with various market capitalizations.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, the fund has held steady, offering a 21.68% one-year return, and roughly 9.15% since inception. Total return (NAV) is slightly in line with broader market performance, with year-to-date returns of 2.77%, as of May 2024.\n\nA diverse fund holding ensures that investors obtain the necessary exposure to large-cap technology and network stocks, with iPhone maker, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) having the top spot, with 5.67% of the fund invested in Apple shares.\n\nOther notable holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO).\n\nThe Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF is more than a fund directed at network mobility. Instead, Defiance claims that this fund allows investors to gain traction in a rapidly growing industry that’s connected to more than mobile devices, but instead sees some of its biggest customers being in healthcare, finance, and data generation.\n\niShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM) is a broad technology fund with roughly 278 holdings in North American equities. The objective of the fund is to provide investors with more diversified exposure to North American equities and companies operating in the technology sector, including communication services and the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nOn top of this, the fund manages several holdings related to hardware, software, internet marketing, and interactive media. Overall, the Expanded Tech Sector ETF aims to provide North American and international investors with an expressed view of advanced technology companies and the broader tech sector.\n\nBased on current performance data, the iShares Extended Tech Sector ETF has gained roughly 10.59 since its inception back in 2001. One year total return is currently standing at 52.97%, which for some investors might seem outlandish considering the fund's broad exposure to various capital sectors.\n\nThe staggering performance of the fund can be largely attributed to its ability to invest in a large quantity of diverse tech and software companies. At the top of the list, companies such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) make up the largest portion of fund distributions.\n\nOutside of investing in major tech companies, most of which are part of the Magnificent Seven, the fund has much of its distributions held up in the semiconductor and interactive media services, investing 24.0% and 19.31% of the fund, respectively. Other sectors of importance include application and system software, and lesser-known services such as IT consulting and communication equipment.\n\nSince the turn of the year, the fund has gained 17.73%, while the broader S&P 500 has risen 11.29% YTD, and the S&P 500 Information Technology index is up by 16.24% YTD.\n\nRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\n\nAnother suitable option for investors looking to invest in large-cap high-tech companies is the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) which invests in the top 7 tech stocks and provides investors with more exposure to heavy-weight competitors.\n\nFor investors that are not yet aware, the Magnificent Seven is the collective name given to the largest, and most prominent tech companies and includes Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nIn the last couple of years, these seven trailblazing companies have helped push technology stocks to new heights, and the widespread development of artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fuel the next generation of tech and software developers.\n\nMAGS offers investors pure exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, reducing direct volatile risk exposure and weighting out portfolio distribution. On average, distribution holdings are fairly equal, although currently 16.36% is invested in Alphabet Class A shares, with Meta Platforms taking the bottom position with 12.61% fund allocation.\n\nThough the fund offers direct pure exposure to mega-cap tech stocks, seasoned professionals might be skeptical about the long-term viability of MAGS. For starters, the fund is relatively new, coming onto the market in November 2023, meaning that many investors still have limited amounts of data to clearly define their forward-looking position of the fund.\n\nSecondly, the fund solely holds seven stocks, meaning that risk distribution to return potential is seemingly higher, and can be considered a drawback for older, more seasoned investors that are looking to lower these risks and direct capital towards more buoyant long-term options.\n\nFinally, a principal investment strategy of MAGS is to invest at least 80% of its assets, including borrowings for investment purposes in the financial instruments of its holdings that provide the best exposure, or a combination of economic characteristics.\n\nThis could mean that should one of its holdings, or several others experience a significant decline in revenue, profit, market share, or market capitalization, the fund could then possibly experience declined near-term returns.\n\nThough it’s an ambitious technology fund that gives the best possible exposure to the Magnificent Seven, perhaps investors who are looking to reduce risks and mitigate near-term volatility would be best suited to opt for something more geared towards their forward-looking goals.\n\nVanEck Robotics ETF\n\nOn paper, the VanECK Robotics ETF (IBOT) offers a multi-dynamic investment opportunity that sees the fund invest in large-scale technological projects and developments supported by global market demand.\n\nIBOT exposure is directed toward high-growth companies, the majority focusing on future industrial automation and technological acceleration. Based on current data, IBOT invests the majority of its capital in the information technology sector, followed by industrial and consumer discretionary. Other, smaller holdings are focused on healthcare, energy, and cash.\n\nThe fund aims to replicate the performance of the BlueState Robotics Index which tracks companies that are closely involved in the field of robotics research and development.\n\nOverall, the BlueStar Robotics Index has held steady performance, with the index rising 23.45% over the past 12 months. The BlueStar Robotics Index has distributions across the world, investing in highly developed and high-growth capital markets, including the U.S., Japan, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, among other countries.\n\nSince its inception back in April 2023, the VanEck robotics fund has gained roughly 21.39%, slightly below the 22.16% return reported by the BlueStar Robotics Index during the same period. However, a yearly return is currently reported at 22.17%, which could give a positive indication for investors looking to actively leverage the robotics industry.\n\nIn a report by the International Federation of Robotics, recent data showed that in 2023, manufacturing companies across the world, and primarily in the U.S. have heavily invested in production line and supply chain automation. During the period, robotic installations rose by 12%, reaching more than 44,300 units in 2023, with the automotive industry being the top adopter of automation and robotic equipment.\n\nOn the back of surging growth and demand, IBOT could be the link investors need to tap into the marketing of automation and robotic equipment. With both the private and public sectors now plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into the world of robotics automation, IBOT could perhaps be the turning point for novice and seasoned investors.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nLast on the list is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) which aims to track the performance of a benchmark index through passively managed strategies, including a full-replication strategy when possible.\n\nAs the name suggests, VGT is focused on investment movement within the information technology sector with 27.60% of its weighted exposure allocated to the semiconductor sector. The systems software sector follows second, making up 22.90% of the fund, and technology hardware, storage, and peripherals take up 17.30%.\n\nAlthough these are only three of the primary sectors the fund is invested in, holdings such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Cisco Systems, and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) are among the 313 other companies that make up the broader diversification of VGT.\n\nFor the physical year-end 31 August 2023, Vanguard Information Technology ETF reported a strong turnover rate of 15.4%, while the fund currently has an earnings growth rate of 2.07%, according to recent fund information.\n\nOther performance data indicates that VGT managed to slightly outperform the benchmark one-year performance rate. VGT reported a 12-month return of 29.70%, while the benchmark return was 29.66%.\n\nFor investors who are seeking more weighted security and direct exposure to the domestic information technology sector, VGT is considered a reasonably safer option for long-term opportunities and provides a seemingly secure holdings distribution.\n\nRiding Out Uncertainty\n\nAs the bull run is expected to extend well into the coming months, looking toward the technology sector for better portfolio and performance buoyancy is becoming a sure strategic decision for investors and Wall Street investment firms.\n\nAlthough uncertainty continues to loom overhead, with geopolitical tension and tight interest rates keeping some investors at bay, those seeking to leverage current market conditions are holding steady on technology stocks and ETFs due to a positive turnaround in the market.\n\nArguably, conditions are looking surprisingly positive for both ends of the spectrum. The S&P 500 Information Technology index is above the broader S&P 500, gaining 16.24% compared to 11.29% year to date. On a quarterly basis, similar conditions are playing out, as the S&P tech sector index gained 3.34% compared to 1.02% on the S&P.\n\nMarket conditions are piping hot, and investors aren’t taking a backseat anytime soon. Yet, broader economic conditions and the possibility of a hard landing remain deciding factors for some seasoned investors who are hoping to ride out near-term volatility.\n\nFinishing Thoughts\n\nTechnology is rapidly changing the way we work and communicate, and the companies spearheading the race to innovation are casting a bright light on new opportunities on the stock market.\n\nThough there is still a lot of uncertainty up ahead, both in relation to macroeconomic conditions and the global political environment, investors should consider seeking out investments, and diverse funds that not only provide stability but offer them the necessary long and near-term broad exposure in advanced tech sectors that can ride out uncertainty,m while providing sufficient portfolio buoyancy.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: I recently initiated a small position in Tesla, no other positions in any other positions mentioned.\n\nRelated Content\n\n10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy Now Should You Hold Nvidia (NVDA)?

        "title": "Apple is getting a once-in-a-decade secret weapon in AI-enabled ‘intelliphones.’ Bank of America sees its stock surging 20%",
        "content": "Apple is about to get a new secret weapon that could lead to some juicy returns for investors: AI-focused phones. Bank of America analysts call them “IntelliPhones,” and in a Wednesday note, they argued that these high-powered devices will be an entirely new breed compared to the current raft of smartphones.\n\nSenior equity research analyst Wamsi Mohan and his team described a future where phones will need far more computing power in order to handle the daily use of “AI agents” that will help with everything from booking travel and real-time translation to scheduling and tutoring. For Apple and its installed base of over 2.2 billion active smartphones, that means a massive opportunity to sell customers on the latest and greatest AI tech.\n\n“We see the introduction of AI smartphones (IntelliPhones) as a once in a decade upgrade event,” Mohan and his team wrote, forecasting “a multi-year upgrade cycle similar to the step function improvement driven by the introduction of smartphones.”\n\nIntelliPhones are set to offer a new experience for consumers that smartphones won’t be able to compete with, including augmented and virtual reality experiences, health monitoring, and more, according to BofA’s analysts. “As AI technology evolves the gap between IntelliPhones and traditional smartphones is likely to widen further by offering even more sophisticated and personalized functions driving the desire to upgrade,” they wrote.\n\nShares of Apple have risen just over 7% during the past 12 months, lagging compared to the S&P 500, and particularly, the soaring big tech sector. But with the era of AI-enabled phones on the horizon, Bank of America analysts expect a turnaround. Mohan and his team reiterated their “buy” rating and a $230 price target on shares of Apple Wednesday. It’s an outlook that represents a potential 20% gain for Apple investors over the next 12 months, but that rise would also leave the Cupertino-based tech giant with a lofty valuation of 30 times its fiscal year 2025 earnings.\n\nStill, Mohan and his team said that they believe that higher valuation “is justified given a multi-year [iPhone] upgrade cycle, large cash balance and opportunity to diversify into new end markets, increasing mix and diversity of services.”\n\n“We see IntelliPhones dominating edge AI, as compared to AI PCs, given their portability, features and cost,” he added.\n\nOne of the keys to the success of IntelliPhones will be AI developers, according to Bank of America. Mohan and his team said they believe that developers will build AI agents that will run on Apple’s phones, creating “a new layer of monetization” for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe comments echo the AI optimism that CEO Tim Cook described in Apple’s May 2 earnings call. “We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration, groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engines, and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create,” he said.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino also maintained his “buy” rating on shares of Apple Tuesday, citing improved iPhone sales prospects in China due to the company’s AI push. After iPhone sales in China wavered in 2022 and 2023 amid rising geopolitical tensions with the U.S. and increased domestic competition, Apple managed to turn things around in April. iPhone sales jumped 52% from a year ago to 3.5 million units last month, and Zino believes Apple’s AI ambitions are likely to kickstart more growth.\n\n“AAPL's ambitions towards greater AI capabilities ahead of the iPhone 16 launch this fall should appeal to China consumers and also better position it at the high-end of the market,” he wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Virtual Victors: The Top 3 Stocks That Will Dominate the Metaverse Landscape",
        "content": "On Wall Street, reality may blur with the virtual, while investors search for top metaverse stocks.\n\nThe metaverse refers to a virtual world where users can interact, play and socialize in an immersive and interactive environment. With the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies, the metaverse is poised to revolutionize the way we live, work and play. The segment is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 41%.\n\nAs the metaverse continues to evolve, investors are seeking exposure to the companies driving this innovation with cutting-edge technologies, platforms and experiences. From gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare, the metaverse has the potential to transform industries and create new growth opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s delve into three top metaverse stocks to buy that are paving the way for a new era of immersive digital engagement.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is a leading innovator in haptics technology, which allows users to experience realistic touch sensations through digital devices. IMMR develops haptic feedback solutions across various industries. Those include mobile phones, automotive user interfaces and gaming peripherals. Their comprehensive portfolio enables manufacturers to integrate immersive touch feedback into their products.\n\nThe haptics technology innovator reported stellar financial results for the first quarter in April. Total revenue soared to $43.8 million, a dramatic 520% year-over-year (YOY) increase from $7.1 million. This robust performance significantly surpassed analyst estimates of $24.94 million. Net income climbed to $19.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $9.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nImmersion inked significant licensing deals in the first quarter of 2024, solidifying its market position. A February agreement granted Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) access to Immersion’s haptics patents for their hardware, software, VR, and gaming products. This deal highlighted the growing role of haptics in the metaverse. Additionally, Immersion renewed its licensing agreement with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) in March, ensuring continued use of their technology in Nintendo’s gaming products.\n\nAs a result, IMMR stock has gained 38% year-to-date (YTD), reaching multi-year highs. Shares are trading at an attractive 8.2x forward earnings and 4.4x sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $10.50 for IMMR, signaling roughly a 10% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a real-time 3D development platform where creators can build interactive experiences. In fact, Unity’s reach extends far beyond video games. It allows a diverse set of creators to develop VR applications, architectural visualizations and automotive design simulations as well.\n\nYet, the 3D platform developer recently reported mixed financial results. Total revenues declined 8% YOY to $460.4 million, yet beat analyst estimates by 6%. Diluted net loss per share widened 12% to came in at 75 cents, higher than anticipated.\n\nIn a move poised to revolutionize the in-cabin car experience, Unity and Mazda Motor (OTCMKTS:MZDAY) have recently forged a strategic partnership. This collaboration will leverage Unity’s development platform to create a next-generation human-machine interface (HMI) and graphic user interface (GUI) for future Mazda vehicles.\n\nSo far in 2024, U stock has plunged close to 50%, while the stock is currently trading at 3.7 times sales. Yet, Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of U stock with a price forecast of $26, an upside of 25%. Interested investors could regard declines below $19 as opportunity to initiate positions in U shares.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) the word \"etf\" spelled out in many yellow cubes against a background of many black cubes\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Imagentle\n\nThe last top metaverse stock is the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pure-play for investing in businesses at the forefront of the metaverse market. These companies might be involved in hardware (VR headsets, haptic technology) and software development (game engines, 3D creation tools). In addition, networking infrastructure and even payment solutions that will facilitate transactions within virtual worlds enter the domain of the fund.\n\nMETV, which has 38 holdings, was launched in June 2021. The top 10 names make up about 50% of net assets of $406 million. In terms of sectors, we see gaming platform (22%) followed by computing components (19%), cloud solutions (14.9%) and video games (11.6%). About 70% of the companies are U.S.-based. Others come from China (8.7%), Japan (6.7%), South Korea (6.0%) and others. Leading holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); Roblox (NYSE:ROBLOX), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nSince January, METV has returned around 10%, and recently hit a 2-year high. Yet, the current valuation appears favorable with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.1x . Investors looking to capitalize on the next iteration of the internet can find the METV ETF a compelling option. Finally, potential investors should also note the expense ratio of 0.59%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Apple Signals That It’s Working on TV+ App for Android Phones",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is seeking a senior engineer to help build a television and sports app for Android, a sign the company is finally bringing its TV+ service to the rival smartphone platform.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers Wall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century\n\nIn a job listing published in recent days, Apple said it’s looking for someone to lead the development of “fun new features” and “help build an application used by millions to watch and discover TV and sports.” A spokesman for Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe move suggests that the company is looking to gain market share in video streaming — and is setting aside its rivalry with Android in order to chase additional users. It’s rare for Apple to develop software for Google’s Android, which competes with its iOS platform.\n\nThe TV+ service, launched in 2019, is Apple’s answer to Netflix or Disney+, and the company has spent heavily on feeding it with original content. But it’s hard to tell how many consumers have embraced the offering. Though the company scored a best picture win at the Oscars in 2022, Apple has never disclosed how many subscribers the service has or how much revenue it generates.\n\nAndroid would provide a big source of potential viewers. Though Apple dominates the market for high-end smartphones, Android has more users globally. The operating system powers more than 3 billion devices around the world. Apple has roughly 2.2 billion active devices, with the majority of those being iPhones.\n\nApple has long sought to put TV+ on as many platforms as possible and already offers apps for smart TVs, Roku, Amazon streaming devices and game consoles — but it shunned an Android app when TV+ launched.\n\nWhile Apple offers its music streaming service on Android, it has declined to release apps like FaceTime and iMessage on the operating system. The concern within the company is that putting a popular feature like iMessage on Android will threaten iPhone sales. Though Apple launched a web version of FaceTime a few years ago, it stopped short of creating a dedicated Android app.\n\nTV+ isn’t a total stranger to Android, though. Apple has offered the service on Google Chromecast streaming devices and many smart televisions — with the Apple TV app running on the Android operating system. But the new job listing suggests the company is now planning something more extensive, telling applicants they will “design and architect a sophisticated application.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move is the latest sign that Apple’s attitude may be changing. Earlier this year, it launched standalone versions of Music, TV and device-management apps for Windows. More broadly, the company is relying more heavily on services for revenue growth, rather than just devices.\n\nLike its streaming peers, Apple also has raised the price of its TV+ service. Last year, it bumped the rate to $9.99 a month — twice the level when TV+ launched five years ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhy Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos New York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley Who Is Most Likely to Succeed at Elon High?

        "content": "Tencent's New Hit Game DnF Mobile Earns $140M In First Week\n\nTencent Holdings Ltd's (OTC:TCEHY) blockbuster release Dungeon & Fighter Mobile has made a remarkable debut in China, raking in over $140 million in player spending during its first week.\n\nThe impressive start cements its place as one of the most lucrative launches in the global gaming market, Bloomberg reported.\n\nReleased on May 21, DnF Mobile has amassed $63 million on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store in China, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nIt translates to over $140 million in total player spending across all mobile platforms, including Android stores, as estimated by gaming researcher Niko Partners.\n\nDnF Mobile's Success is based on the popular franchise developed by Nexon Co., which has topped both download and grossing charts over the past week.\n\nWith 2.6 million downloads on iPhones in China, the game's popularity even led to a suspension shortly after launch due to server issues.\n\nLong-awaited Arrival in China follows a prolonged delay caused by Beijing's crackdown on the internet industry, which included a halt on game approvals.\n\nRelated Read: Alibaba Sparks AI Price War With Massive Discounts: Report\n\nDnF Mobile's successful entry has provided a boost to Tencent, pushing its other hits like Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite down the charts, thereby securing the top three most profitable games in China last week.\n\nFuture Investor Focus is now on whether Tencent can maintain the game's initial success. The company leveraged aggressive marketing, including animated ads in WeChat, to ensure a fast launch.\n\nIf sustained, DnF Mobile could generate over $1 billion in sales for Tencent this year, constituting about 5% of its domestic game sales.\n\nComparative Performance shows that 2020's Genshin Impact by Mihoyo garnered around $60 million globally in its first week, excluding third-party Android stores in China, as per Sensor Tower.\n\nTencent's Strategy includes ramping up new game launches following the pause in license approvals.\n\nDuring its annual games event, the company announced over a dozen upcoming titles, including the anticipated console game Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nPrice Action: TCEHY shares closed lower by 0.27% at $48.33 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: TikTok Parent ByteDance Overtakes Baidu In AI Chatbot Race In China: Report\n\nPhoto by katjen via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Tencent's New Hit Game DnF Mobile Earns $140M In First Week originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "MILAN (Reuters) - Payments companies Nexi, Stripe and Adyen have started offering businesses in Italy a way to accept payments from customers that relies on Apple's iPhones, they said on Wednesday.\n\nApple's Tap to Pay service uses a wireless technology known as near-field communication (NFC) which allows the exchange of data between devices over a short distance.\n\nNexi, Europe's biggest payments group by volume of transactions processed, already offered shopowners the chance to use their phone to process payments using the NexiSoftPOS application.\n\nUntil now, however, that could be used only on phones running on an Android operating system and not Apple's iOs.\n\nUsing a smartphone to process payments is particularly useful for small shops, which can in this way avoid having to pay for a specific piece of hardware.\n\nDutch group Adyen, which mostly provides e-commerce services to large corporate clients but has been widening its offer to include bricks-and-mortar stores, also said it was launching the Tap to Pay service. Milanese luxury brand Prada would offer it in its shops starting with Italy's fashion capital.\n\nStripe, which competes with Adyen to supply payments services to companies, said it was adopting the Apple service.\n\n\"Tap to Pay on iPhone means Italian companies can now accept contactless payments with a device a lot of us already carry in our pockets,\" said Ruhi Dang, Stripe's product manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n\n(Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Keith Weir)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Milei Pitches Argentina to Silicon Valley After Setbacks at Home",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Javier Milei will pitch investing in Argentina to Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. this week in California, building on an unprecedented wave of international recognition in a bid to fortify his political strength at home.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld’s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar ‘Not Gonna Be Pretty:’ Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump Warning Signals Are Flashing for Homeowners in Texas and Florida New BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers Wall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century\n\nThe libertarian economist’s meetings with Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg during a 36-hour window would be on a wish list for almost any leader. But they’re particularly welcome for Milei, who badly needs foreign investment to help turn around an economy battling annual inflation near 300% and a worsening recession. It’s also an A-list dance card none of his recent predecessors could score, elevating his profile at home.\n\n“Milei’s personality and radical ideas are creating an unusual investor interest in Argentina, in almost every sector,” said Marcelo García, director for the Americas at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. “His challenge now is to turn the photo ops into concrete investments in the country.”\n\nOptimism around the West Coast trip contrasts with Milei’s domestic setbacks. He fired his cabinet chief Monday less than six months into the job, he hasn’t yet lifted currency controls and he missed a self-imposed deadline last week to win approval for his signature piece of legislation. The bill contains a range of pro-business, deregulation measures to attract investment from the likes of Silicon Valley and would also serve as a template for Milei to work with an adversarial Congress if it passes.\n\nThe president has nonetheless maintained high approval ratings in Argentina, despite his harsh austerity measures and confrontational attitude toward Congress, which he decries as a “rat’s nest.” So far he’s delivering on his chief promise to rein in runaway prices, with monthly inflation forecast to come around 5% in May from a peak of 26% in December when he took office.\n\nBeyond Buenos Aires, Milei is getting a lot of attention abroad. Time magazine put him on the cover last week and he’s received ample praise from billionaires like Elon Musk for rapidly cutting spending. So far this year he’s also made appearances at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington and the Milken Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe San Francisco jaunt is also Milei’s first opportunity to prove whether he can recruit the world’s top companies to expand operations or, in the case of Apple, break ground on a store in Argentina. So far, his trips abroad have focused on fortifying relationships with political allies aligned with his free market, anti-establishment approach, such as Donald Trump in the US or Santiago Abascal of the far-right Vox Party in Spain. He’s generally left investor meetings to his economic team, despite his own corporate background as an economist.\n\nIt’s not immediate clear what Milei is offering Cook, Zuckerberg and Pichai, among others. For Musk, the Argentine president published a decree to allow Starlink to sell its satellite internet in the country. More broadly, the nation’s protectionist policies have made iPhones and other high-end products cost nearly double what they do in the US, while its labor laws, currency controls and capital restrictions have discouraged some major multinationals from having a larger presence.\n\n“Beyond Milei rubbing shoulders with the people who are leading the most important change of the century, which is very important for Argentina, he’s giving a very clear signal of where things are going,” said Alberto Ades, a director at investment advisory firm NWI Management.\n\nThe president not only recognizes where the world is headed, Ades added, but he’s also trying to “embrace that path with enthusiasm.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York’s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point Why Dave & Buster’s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos Elon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley When Business Is Just a Game The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox, click here.\n\nOur top writers at InvestorPlace.com – our free news and analysis website – take a look at five AI dominators they believe could become trillion-dollar companies over the next decade. These firms are examples of just how quickly the AI revolution will upend existing businesses as we know them… and why you need to be paying attention.\n\nThe AI Dominators: Arm Holdings (ARM) The Arm logo seen at semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings' US Headquarters in San Jose, California. ARM IPO\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm (NASDAQ:ARM) is a U.K.-based chip designer that produces a rival standard to the traditional x86 architecture. It’s a simpler, more power-efficient chip design that’s now found in almost 99% of battery-powered computing hardware, including smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm’s architecture is also modular; large clients like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) can turn chip features on and off as needed. As Faisal Humayun notes for InvestorPlace.com, this attribute has recently given ARM an enormous edge in custom AI chips, which require increasing amounts of customization:\n\nAn important point to note is that Arm has moved away from general-purpose CPUs to products catering to specific industries. The company offers AI-enabled CPUs for mobile, consumer electronics, IoT, automobile and cloud & networking. Therefore, the addressable market is significant, and royalty revenue will continue to swell. With the stock relatively undiscovered, it’s a good time for exposure.\n\nHumayun believes shares could triple over the next two years as Arm architecture expands from smartphones into servers and PCs.\n\nIn addition, Arm’s royalty rates are also on the rise. Its most recent V9 standard has more than twice the blended royalty rate of past versions. That means revenues will grow even faster over the long run as older chip models are eventually phased out, making Arm a potential trillion-dollar company hiding in plain sight.\n\n2. Qualcomm (QCOM) An image of a black marble sign surrounded by flowers and grass with the text \"Qualcomm\" and \"416-977-7151\" on it in a silver font.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe shift to Arm architecture is also helping Qualcomm win market share in AI.\n\nQualcomm is the world’s largest maker of smartphone processors – a mature market that saw shipments shrink 4% last year. Qualcomm itself saw revenues decline as much as 23% as end customers drew down existing inventories.\n\nHowever, the chipmaker’s experience with Arm’s customizable architecture has suddenly vaulted it back to growth. As Marc Guberti summarizes in an InvestorPlace.com article:\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm is enabling leading on-device AI capabilities. Those tailwinds can change the tide. It was only a few quarters ago when Qualcomm reported double-digit YoY revenue declines, so the recent earnings report shows a positive development.\n\nThe effect is particularly strong in automotive. In March, Qualcomm’s management announced that revenues from its automotive segment had risen 35%, compared to a 1% rise in smartphone chip sales. Cars are becoming more computationally reliant, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Ride chips are giving Nvidia’s offerings a run for their money.\n\nQualcomm is also seeing some early successes in PC chips, thanks to its 2022 acquisition of Nuvia, a chip-designing firm that specialized in the compute-intensive chips that Qualcomm lacked. The company’s Snapdragon X Elite has already won several notable contracts, and will prominently feature in the next generation of AI PCs.\n\nIt might take another several years for Qualcomm to beat the incumbents in servers or automotive applications. But once change begins in earnest, history tells us that Qualcomm can dominate markets in the blink of an eye.\n\n3. Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an aggregator of networking and wireless chip companies. Years of smart acquisitions have turned the San Jose, California-based firm into an industry powerhouse, and it now sells everything from acoustic resonators to virtualization software. Broadcom’s latest acquisition was a mammoth $69 billion purchase of VMware in 2023.\n\nFinancial returns have been excellent, thanks to the company’s wise use of capital and growing demand for high-speed networking solutions. Operating margins of 45% are some of the highest in the tech industry.\n\nRich Duprey now notes at InvestorPlace.com that Broadcom’s dominance in networking puts it at the forefront of the AI Revolution. Artificial intelligence runs well in parallel, which has increased demand for hyperscalers – enormous data centers that can service thousands of customers at once. Broadcom’s high-speed networking gear, Duprey writes, is exactly what these centers need:\n\nAlthough Broadcom is best known for the semiconductors it makes for mobile handsets, the chipmaker pivoted to data center infrastructure and its custom accelerators are in high demand. Broadcom reported first-quarter AI revenue surged 300% to $2.3 billion. It now expects AI will account for 35% of 2024 total revenue, or $10 billion. That’s up from its previous forecast of $8 billion. As data centers are a major growth market for the foreseeable future, there is still plenty of time to buy into AVGO stock.\n\nLouis Navellier and the InvestorPlace.com research staff also note that Broadcom could benefit from future developments in areas like quantum computing, sensing, measurement and engineering. Though these efforts aren’t expected to pan out until at least 2025, Broadcom’s history as a consolidator means the firm could see even greater upside over the next decade.\n\n4. Adobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is the undisputed leader in content creation software. Its products span photo editing (Photoshop), video-making (Premiere Pro), document files (Acrobat PDF), and more. Many credit the firm with revolutionizing the world of digital art.\n\nToday, the groundbreaking firm is at it again. In 2023, Adobe began experimenting in Photoshop, allowing generative AI to automatically fill in areas based on user commands. And the company has since released increasingly powerful versions of this software. Users can now fine-tune and improve AI-based content in ways not possible on rival platforms like Midjourney or OpenAI’s Dall-E.\n\nJoey Frenette, at InvestorPlace.com, also notes that Adobe is branching out into other AI-related areas:\n\nMore recently, the firm made a big splash in the realm of AI video generation and editing. From text-to-video to AI-assisted video editing in Premier Pro, it’s clear Adobe wants a big piece of the AI creative market.\n\nAll of this suggests any existential threat from generative AI is overblown. Microsoft Word won’t disappear overnight because ChatGPT is writing homework assignments… and neither will Photoshop or Premiere Pro simply because Dall-E can pump out images. AI-generated content needs editing, fine-tuning, and customization, and Adobe provides the software needed to turn these AI drafts into professional-quality products.\n\n5. ServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final AI dominator today was going to be my top choice of IT specialist. But it’s hard to choose between AI-forward software companies. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is an AI leader in finance… Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in customer relations management… Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) in human capital management… the list goes on. No matter where you look, AI-focused firms are dominating their respective industries.\n\nSo, I’m suggesting ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), the company that sits on top of all these processes. The company’s NOW Platform interfaces with disparate vendors, allowing enterprises to select the best solutions without increasing the amount of maintenance work. And as Mohammed Saqib explains in an InvestorPlace.com article:\n\nThe company continues to make significant strides in helping enterprises automate and optimize its operations. It boasts an impressive client roster that includes 85% of the Fortune 500 companies. Also, ServiceNow’s platform is a critical tool for businesses looking to enhance efficiency and implement digital transformation strategies.\n\nThe result, so far, has been excellent. Sales at ServiceNow rose 23% in 2023, while operating profits increased roughly 30%. Analysts expect similar growth rates through 2027 as demand continues to grow.\n\nServiceNow itself is also a leader in generative AI. In 2023, the company became one of the first software firms to release enterprise-focused AI solutions, according to analysts at Morningstar. And it’s already earning extra revenues from these offerings from higher list prices. Though NOW shares trade at a significant premium, the company seems set to grow into these valuations… and then some… over the next decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We’re in the middle of a Baby Bust. Births have been trending sharply lower since 2007. The number of babies born in America is now at its lowest level since 1979.\n\nAccording to the research platform Microtrends, the current birth rate for the U.S. is 1.787 live births per woman. That’s less than the 2.1 births per woman a nation needs to simply replace itself from one generation to the next (excluding immigration).\n\nIn 1979, the birth rate was 1.81 live births per woman. That doesn’t seem very much bigger than today until you put it in perspective: Our population today – at 333.3 million – is 48% bigger than it was – at 225.1 million – in 1979.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means the number of babies born now is far lower than 1979 levels. In short, our birth rate has plummeted, as is clearly visible in the chart below.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nAnd what effect is it having?\n\nLet’s address one question at a time.\n\nWhy Are Americans Today Having so Few Children?\n\nThe simple answer is that they’re broke and can’t afford them.\n\nMost would-be parents are not financially prepared enough to start families when they kick off their professional lives buried in tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in student-loan debt.\n\nEven if they were ready for that white picket fence in the suburbs, they’d have a hard time finding an affordable house. According to Redfin, home affordability is the worst it’s been in nearly 40 years… and that assumes two working parents. Having a new mom take time off to be with her baby is pure fantasy for most young couples.\n\nTo add insult to injury, white-collar hiring across much of the U.S. – in industries such as finance, technology, media, law, and accounting – has stalled. So starting your career and growing in it is as hard as it’s ever been.\n\nThis is borne out by an increasing number of reports in mainstream media decrying the shortage of college-level jobs available for new graduates. And white-collar jobs in the entertainment and technology sectors are increasingly hard to come by as some of the biggest employers – such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) subsidiary Optum – continue layoffs.\n\nThis is increasingly leading to a troubling trend of underemployment amongst college graduates. According to New York Times’ columnist Peter Coy, 52% of college grads are underemployed a year after graduation, working in jobs that don’t require the degrees they earned. A decade after graduation, 45% of graduates are underemployed.\n\nStory continues\n\nNever mind that these young adults are trying to start a career and family saddled with student loan debt. The average federal student loan debt in 2023 was $37,088. The total average (including private loan debt) is $39,981.\n\nAll of this is to say that young adults are increasingly delaying starting a family and having children because they simply cannot afford to do so. They can barely afford to move out of their parents’ house, let alone feed and raise little humans that not only cost a fortune to feed and educate, but also require daycare – itself an exorbitant expense – for both parents to work.\n\nPointing the Finger\n\nWe can thank the Federal Reserve and governmental financial incompetence for this mess.\n\nWhen the Fed injected $5 trillion into the monetary system during the pandemic, it inflated the prices of virtually all assets, including homes. The resulting inflation forced the central bank to then aggressively raise interest rates, which made affordability even worse.\n\nAnd a deficit rising by $1 trillion every 100 days is exacerbating the inflation problem.\n\nI don’t see any of this getting better any time soon.\n\nThe forces pushing Americans into having smaller families or not having families at all don’t turn on a dime. If anything, they’ll likely get worse before they get better.\n\nAll we can do is protect ourselves from the potential fallout.\n\nThis requires smart – and agile – investing.\n\nHave inflation hedges in your investment portfolio.\n\nInvest in companies with good track records in essential industries. And add short-term investing – even trading – to your wealth-creation arsenal.\n\nHere are three stocks to buy now to achieve all three goals… and ultimately protect you against the ravages a declining population (a topic for another day) will have on the U.S. economy.\n\nProtection Stock No. 1: National Retail Properties (NNN) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nTens of millions of Americans depend on Social Security to meet their basic income needs in retirement. But a pay-as-you-go system like this isn’t fundamentally different from a Ponzi scheme. It works so long as there are a lot of young workers paying into the system and relatively few retirees drawing benefits.\n\nThat’s not the situation today… and the lower the birth rate goes or the longer it stays depressed, the worse the math gets.\n\nNo politician wants to touch this – they call Social Security the “third rail of American politics” for a reason – but math is math.\n\nIf you still have a few years until you draw Social Security, you should just assume that substantially all of it will be taxed and that your benefits will likely shrink, at least relative to inflation.\n\nThis means you need income. One nice source of reliable and growing income is in high-traffic, mission-critical real estate.\n\nTake a look at National Retail Properties (NYSE:NNN). This real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a diverse portfolio of convenience stores, car washes, and other properties that tend to be both recession proof and future proof.\n\nThe stock sports a dividend yield of 5.4%, in line with T-bills.\n\nBut unlike bond interest – which is fixed – NNN’s dividend has historically risen over time. It’s raised its dividend for 34 consecutive years and counting.\n\nA stock like this can help to supplement shortfalls in your Social Security check.\n\nProtection Stock No. 2: SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM) A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDemographic pressures are going to put enormous strain on the dollar in the decades ahead. I can’t tell you exactly how this plays out, but I expect it to look something like this…\n\nThe national debt is already closing in on $35 trillion. We’re adding an extra trillion every 100 days. That’s not sustainable. At some point, our lenders – the bond market – will balk, requiring a much higher interest rate to compensate for the higher risk of a borrower this deeply in debt.\n\nAt that point, selling bonds becomes prohibitively expensive… so the Federal Reserve steps in and effectively directly finances the government.\n\nIf you don’t have at least a couple dollar hedges in your portfolio, you’re risking your financial future.\n\nOne of the best and most reliable dollar hedges is gold. You could buy coins and keep them somewhere safe, of course. But for your IRA or other financial accounts, it’s generally going to be easier to buy an ETF like the SPDR Gold MiniShares (NYSEARCA:GLDM).\n\nProtection Stock No. 3: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnd finally, throughout war, peace, inflation, deflation, and every manner of financial calamity, America’s biggest and best-run blue-chip companies have a way of surviving and thriving. This is why, at The Freeport Society, we call them the “rich man’s super currency.”\n\nAs a long-term wealth protector and grower, you need quality growth companies. One such company is the AI chip darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThis is a company that has redefined itself twice in the past decade alone, evolving from a maker of video game graphics chips to a maker of Bitcoin mining chips. Now it’s becoming the leading maker of the chips needed to power the AI boom.\n\nThe stock looks a bit rich at today’s prices, so you might want to wait for a pullback before jumping in. But regardless, always make sure that your portfolio has a core of quality growth stocks.\n\nWith these three stocks, and others along the same lines, you can prepare yourself from the fall out of the collapsing American family.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Sizemore held a LONG position in NNN and BTC-USD.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Not that it's a contest, but a company's relative size -- as measured by revenue, earnings, or market cap -- can be a clear indication of its past and present success. More to the point, relative changes to any of these metrics can help investors spot where the real growth is ... and isn't.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three companies that could be bigger than Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) within the next decade. And that's saying something. The iPhone maker's current market cap stands at $2.9 trillion, making it the world's second-biggest publicly traded company (right behind Microsoft).\n\n1. Broadcom\n\nWhen most investors think of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, names like Microsoft or Nvidia come to mind. Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) generally doesn't.\n\nBut maybe it should.\n\nBroadcom manufactures many of the components you'll find in wireless connectivity tech like Wi-Fi routers and wireless modems. It also makes fiber-optic connectivity equipment and Ethernet networking solutions, as well as software that gets the most out of this hardware. Without this company's solutions, the wireless connectivity landscape would look considerably different.\n\nThere's a very specific reason Broadcom could be a bigger company than Apple 10 years from now, though. That's the market Broadcom is quietly penetrating: artificial intelligence (AI). In short, this company makes the chips that AI data centers need but most people never think about.\n\nFor example, take Broadcom's 200G/lane vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), unveiled earlier this year. This is the industry's first such fiber-optic equipment capable of handling the massive loads of digital data being processed and delivered by AI platforms.\n\nAlso earlier this year, the company introduced the industry's first 51.2 terabits-per-second (Tbps) co-packaged optics Ethernet switch, which not only connects multiple processors to one another at blazing-fast speed, but does it using 70% less power than comparable tech. This equipment doesn't compete with Nvidia's processors, but it does complement Nvidia's wares.\n\nAll told, Broadcom expects to sell on the order of $10 billion worth of AI-oriented chips this year. For perspective, that's roughly 10% of the company's projected 2024 top line. This amount still only scratches the surface, though. Straits Research believes the AI infrastructure market is poised to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 21% per year through 2030.\n\nAlready a leader in this overlooked piece of the AI market, Broadcom is positioned to capture more than its fair share of its growth. That growth could readily push its current market cap of $650 billion beyond Apple's down the road. This is particularly true since Apple's business is changing from a growth-oriented one driven by iPhone sales to a slower-moving, value-oriented/cash-cow enterprise led by its services arm.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd speaking of value...\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nWhile Broadcom is a technology growth stock, not every great opportunity has to come from this category of tickers. Indeed, don't be surprised to see incredible growth from a name at the extreme other end of this spectrum -- a value-oriented holding like Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nSurprised? It would be a bit unusual if you weren't. Value stocks are so-called largely because these companies aren't capable of great growth. Their strong suit is consistent cash flow that often translates into reliable dividends. It's no secret that Warren Buffett -- the chief guru behind Berkshire Hathaway -- is content to leave $189 billion of Berkshire's cash uninvested simply because he doesn't see any such stocks worth buying at their present price.\n\nBut there's a very specific strategic reason you might want to consider stepping into a stake in Berkshire Hathaway sooner rather than later: We may be on the verge of a years-long wave of strong performance from value stocks.\n\nUnderpinning this prediction is the current economic backdrop. Interest rates are high, inflation is high, and debt (corporate as well as consumer) is both high and expensive. Although not necessarily recession-causing, these are conditions that often work against growth stocks but aren't overly problematic for value stocks. A handful of value-oriented sectors with strong pricing power -- like utilities and consumer staples -- can thrive in such an environment.\n\nSure, it's a bit concerning that Berkshire would rather do nothing with its idle cash than at least take a shot on a low-risk dividend payer. If its capital isn't put to work, the company's market cap -- currently near $900 billion -- may never reach or eclipse Apple's current capitalization of just under $3 trillion.\n\nDon't worry about it too much, though. Most of Berkshire Hathaway's value is represented by existing holdings in value stocks or privately owned companies. And over the coming decade, Buffett or his deputies will surely find a few more opportunities worth diving into.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nLast but not least, add e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to your list of companies that could be bigger than Apple 10 years from now.\n\nIt has one of the shortest distances to travel. Amazon's current market cap is a whopping $1.9 trillion versus Apple's $2.9 trillion. Granted, Amazon's highest-growth days are also likely in the rearview mirror, and even if Apple's future isn't as compelling as its past it's still making forward progress.\n\nThere is something new about Amazon, however, that could still easily catapult it beyond Apple by 2034. That's the fact that Amazon is finally focused on profitability as much as -- if not more than -- it is on revenue growth. Last quarter's net income margin percentage of 6.4% (of revenue) is the most profitable the company's ever been since the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was an obvious boon for its business. The same quarter's gross profit margin of 47.6% is also a company record, extending a long streak of steady improvement since 2012.\n\nWhat's driving this margin growth? Most investors know the company's cloud computing business is considerably more profitable than its e-commerce operation. Indeed, although Amazon Web Services (AWS) only accounts for about 16% of Amazon's top line, AWS is responsible for roughly two-thirds of the company's operating income. This business's growth is doing more than its fair share of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe piece of the bullish thesis not fully appreciated by interested investors, however, is actually on the e-commerce front. This arm is now more profitable than it's ever been. Nearly 6% of last quarter's North American sales were turned into operating income, while its longtime money-losing international e-commerce operation has swung back into the black, after finally achieving profitability during and because of the pandemic.\n\nWhatever's been missing from the formula -- maybe it was just scale -- is now in place. Most investors don't seem to see this yet, but they will, as Amazon continues to make the most of its massive size and its now fine-tuned operation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky confirms £3.5bn Royal Mail takeover (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nInternational Distributions Services (IDS.L)\n\nRoyal Mail owner International Distribution Services said it has agreed to a £3.57bn ($4.56bn) takeover offer from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s EP Group.\n\nThe offer consists of 360p in cash, plus a final dividend of 2p per share and a special dividend of 8p per share. Including debt, the deal values IDS at £5.28bn.\n\nIDS said if the deal goes through Royal Mail would continue its universal service obligation to one-price-goes-anywhere first-class post six days a week, and keep the company’s branding and UK headquarters.\n\nRead more: The tax pledges to watch for in the UK election\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE - European stock markets head lower as Royal Mail agrees £3.5bn takeover\n\nIt also said it would protect existing employment rights of all IDS staff, and that there is “no intention to make any material changes to overall headcount or reductions in the number of frontline workers” beyond existing plans.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nHeavyweight chip maker Nvidia surged by almost 7% to a new high this last session and is the number one trending ticker in pre-market trading as the AI darling eyes Apple’s (AAPL) spot as the world's second most valuable company by market cap, behind Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNvidia shares soared to a record high on Tuesday, putting it close to overtaking Apple with Nvidia now valued at $2.8tn, just shy of Apple's $2.9tn. Shares finished the day above $1,140.\n\nThe milestone moment comes after Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI said Sunday that it raised $6bn in a Series B funding round, sending Nvidia stock up as much as 8% the following trading day.\n\n\"The market has been struggling to keep up with the company's ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesn't feel like bubble territory,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThe stock has now jumped by a third since the start of May, and by 137% over the year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nBHP (BHP.L) has called for further extension to a bid deadline to allow for more talks over a £39bn takeover of rival Anglo American.\n\nUnder UK takeover rules, the Sydney-based company faces a deadline of 5pm UK time on Wednesday to make an offer for Anglo or walk away for 6 months.\n\n\"BHP believes a further extension of the deadline is required to allow for further engagement on its proposal,” it said.\n\nThe mining company said that it was ready to offer a break fee to Anglo American if the deal was blocked due to anti-trust reasons or if it failed to gain regulatory approval.\n\nRead more: What's next for state pension? Sunak unveils 'Triple Lock Plus'\n\n“BHP is confident that the measures it has proposed to the board of Anglo American provide a viable pathway to resolve the matters raised by Anglo American and would support South African regulatory approvals,” it added.\n\nAnglo previously claimed the offers were too risky and complex. The latest bid valued it at £38.6bn. It came after BHP had put forward two prior bids, valuing Anglo at £31.1bn and £34bn respectively.\n\nAmerican Airlines (AAL)\n\nShares in American Airlines were lower in pre-market trading after the company cut its guidance on second profit as softer demand is expected to dent revenue.\n\nThe Texas-based carrier now expects second-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.15 per share, compared with its previous forecast of between $1.15 and $1.45 per share.\n\nIt forecast total revenue per available seat mile, a proxy for pricing power, to be down about 5% to 6% from a year ago. That compares with a decline of 1% to 3% expected earlier.\n\nThe airline also announced that its chief commercial officer, Vasu Raja, will leave the company next month. He has been in the role since April 2022.\n\nAmerican Airlines said its vice chair and chief strategy officer Stephen Johnson will take on Raja’s brief with immediate effect.\n\nWatch: Nvidia aiming beyond chips with AI ecosystem</p><p>Nvidia's shares have surged nearly 13% since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split.</p><p>Speaking with Reuters' Lisa Bernhard, Mahn noted how the \\\"AI poster child\\\" is looking to \\\"invest massively in their data center business and provide holistic AI solutions as opposed to [just] the chips component.\\\"</p><p>As for Apple, whose shares this year have lagged its megacap tech peers, Mahn said that while he expects it to invest heavily in AI, \\\"I don't anticipate any significant [stock] price performance over the short term while they're making those types of investments.\\\"</p><p>Apple shares were down in afternoon trading despite data showing an uptick in iPhone sales in China.</p><p>Mahn also discussed Tuesday's surprisingly strong consumer confidence data, adding that with stubborn inflation and a rising unemployment rate he doesn't see \\\"what they're so optimistic about.\\\"\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DACi2RhTziaYdK4ik2uuug--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/5fa2c21e78fd194e2496b47d7c778cd8\",\"duration\":\"PT4M26S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/516f0b23-02f4-3c28-9434-1fd5f6ae61fb.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-aiming-beyond-chips-ai-204009699.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"516f0b23-02f4-3c28-9434-1fd5f6ae61fb\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "First Solar Stock (NASDAQ:FSLR): Cheaply Valued and Benefiting from AI",
        "content": "First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), a global solar energy solutions provider headquartered in Arizona, is a cheaply valued AI beneficiary that had been ignored by the market until recently. FSLR stock soared more than 30% between May 20 and 22 based on two pieces of news. First, UBS (NYSE:UBS) identified the company as a major winner of AI-driven electricity demand. Second, China pledged to support the solar industry by ending a price war that significantly impacted the sector’s profitability. I am bullish on FSLR stock, as I believe projected growth is yet to be accurately reflected in its valuation.\n\nThe AI Opportunity\n\nThe rise of generative AI has exerted immense pressure on global electric grids as AI applications require substantial amounts of energy to function. According to a study conducted by Dr. Alexandra Sasha Luccioni, AI and Climate Lead at Hugging Face, generative AI systems use approximately 33 times more energy than computers running task-specific software applications.\n\nAccording to data from the International Energy Agency, global data centers used 460 terawatt hours of electricity in 2022 and will use more than 1,000 terawatt hours of electricity by 2026, growing exponentially because of increasing AI usage. According to the IEA’s findings, this projected electricity consumption by data centers will be equivalent to the consumption in Japan with a population of 125 million.\n\nA quick look at the energy consumption trends of leading AI companies confirms that power usage has increased as a result of AI investments. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), in its Environmental Sustainability Report for 2023 published earlier this month, revealed that carbon emissions have increased by almost 30% since 2020, primarily driven by the construction of new data centers to support AI technology.\n\nThe AI opportunity for First Solar arises as a result of the carbon-neutral goals pledged by governments and multinational companies amid the rise of AI. The U.S., for example, has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% compared to 2005 levels by 2030. Microsoft, on the other hand, has promised to become carbon-negative by 2030. The company also has an ambitious goal to remove all the carbon the company has emitted since its founding by 2050.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also pledged to be carbon neutral for its supply chain and products by 2030. Given the massive rise in electricity consumption due to AI, large-scale companies that invest in AI will be forced to source power from sustainable sources, and First Solar can be seen as one of the biggest winners of this expected development.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting for Growth\n\nFirst Solar is investing to expand its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. to meet the projected increase in solar power demand. During the Q1 earnings call earlier this month, the company discussed expansion plans in Ohio, Alabama, and Louisiana.\n\nThe company is also focused on developing advanced solar technology to improve cost efficiencies and, thereby, profit margins. For example, First Solar is planning to launch a perovskite development line and a new innovation center in the second half of this year.\n\nChina Delivers Good News for FSLR Stock\n\nOn May 22, Chinese regulators pledged to crack down on sales of solar equipment material at below-cost prices, which is good news for established solar companies. Due to the increasing number of solar equipment manufacturers, the last few years saw a build-up of manufacturing facilities, leading to an oversupply in the market. Solar companies have been pushing the Chinese government to intervene for many months with the hopes of eliminating companies that undercut market prices.\n\nFirst Solar, as an established global player, will benefit from the Chinese government’s decision to take action to end pricing wars in the solar sector.\n\nIs First Solar Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn May 21, UBS analysts Jon Windham and William Grippin claimed that First Solar will benefit from the power purchase agreements of large tech companies, as these tech giants have pledged to bank on renewable energy sources to cater to their increasing power consumption in the AI era. The analysts guided for strong earnings per share growth for First Solar, from $7.74 in 2023 to $36.74 by 2027. UBS raised its price target for First Solar to $270 from $252 and kept its Buy rating.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Kashy Harrison followed suit by raising his First Solar price target to $219 from $195. Additionally, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently raised its price target from $240 to $262 and maintained a Buy rating, while Susquehanna issued a price target of $258 after incorporating the projected AI-induced demand for renewable energy. Roth Capital Markets analyst Philip Shen also believes that First Solar will be a key beneficiary of the booming AI sector.\n\nOverall, based on the ratings of 27 Wall Street analysts, the average FSLR stock price target is $238, which implies downside risk of 14.5% from the current market price.\n\nAlthough analyst price targets suggest that investing in First Solar is a risky bet today, recent upgrades indicate that the average price target may continue to rise in the foreseeable future. This expectation is based on the company’s favorable positioning in the renewable energy market and its potential to benefit from increased demand for electricity.\n\nFirst Solar is currently valued at a forward P/E of just 20x, which makes it cheaply valued, given that analysts project a five-fold increase in earnings per share by 2027.\n\nThe Takeaway: First Solar Is Cheap and Attractive\n\nFirst Solar is well-positioned to capture the increasing demand for electricity stemming from the rise of AI technology. The company seems cheaply valued in the market and recent upgrades from Wall Street analysts will likely act as a catalyst pushing the stock price higher. China’s pledge to support the solar sector by targeting suppliers who undercut prices will also add fuel to the recent momentum behind First Solar stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 27.3% of the Entire S&amp;P 500 Index",
        "content": "The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is composed of 500 stocks from 11 different sectors, including information technology, energy, financials, and real estate. While it is the most diversified of the major U.S. stock market indexes, a select few technology stocks are having a growing influence over its performance thanks to their meteoric rise in value.\n\nAs of this writing, the following five companies have a combined market capitalization of $12.5 trillion, accounting for 27.3% of the total value of the entire S&P 500:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $2.9 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $2.8 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $1.9 trillion.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is up 11.5% in 2024 so far. However, the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index -- which assigns an equal weighting to every stock regardless of its market cap -- is up just 4.9%. The difference can be explained (in large part) by the average year-to-date gain of 26.3% in the above five stocks, which highlights their influence over the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are using that experience (and their vast financial resources) to dominate new industries like artificial intelligence (AI). If they succeed, they could become even more influential over the S&P 500.\n\n1. Microsoft: 7.2% of the S&P 500\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company. It was founded in 1975, and some of its flagship products like Windows and Word are still used by billions of people today. Microsoft has expanded beyond software and into gaming, hardware (computers and devices), internet search, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the company agreed to invest $10 billion in AI start-up OpenAI, which created the ChatGPT online chatbot. Microsoft is integrating OpenAI's technology into most of its products to deliver more value for users. The Bing search engine, for example, now features a chatbot interface, and applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel are benefiting from AI's ability to rapidly craft content from text to videos.\n\nMicrosoft has cemented itself as a leader in AI thanks to the OpenAI partnership, and its products will continue to benefit from the start-up's lightning-paced innovation.\n\n2. Apple: 6.2% of the S&P 500\n\nApple makes some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, with 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. That includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. The iPhone also led to successful, billion-dollar spinoff devices like the Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's enormous installed base makes it the perfect distributor of AI software to consumers. The latest iPhone 15 Pro already comes with the Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, designed to process some AI workloads on-device. The company is reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet to decide which AI models will power its future devices, so consumers should expect its next iteration of chips to come with even greater processing capabilities.\n\nEventually, devices like the iPhone might come with advanced AI assistants capable of answering complex questions and crafting emails and social media content (among other things). Modern smartphones are simply pocket-sized computers, and, generally speaking, they have made humanity far more productive. AI is set to accelerate that trend.\n\n3. Nvidia: 5.9% of the S&P 500\n\nGenerative AI is developed, trained, and deployed in large, centralized data centers. Nvidia designs the graphics processing chips (GPUs) that fill those data centers, and they are the most sought-after in the industry among AI developers. During fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU drove the company's data center revenue to $47.5 billion, which was a whopping 217% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company just reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), and growth in its data center revenue accelerated to 427%. The H100 buoyed sales, but shipments of the new H200 GPU are set to begin in Q2. It can inference (the process of feeding live data to an AI model so it can make predictions) twice as fast as the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which could trigger another demand wave from leading data center operators like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.\n\nIn essence, Nvidia remains far ahead of its competitors, and the development of next-generation AI models won't be possible without its GPUs. The company plans to launch a new series of chips later this year that are built on its latest Blackwell architecture, and they will deliver even greater performance.\n\n4. Alphabet: 4.3% of the S&P 500\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, and it's also home to other tech subsidiaries like YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and AI developer DeepMind. Google Search remains Alphabet's largest source of revenue, but investors have questioned whether AI chatbots could unseat its dominance, given their ability to provide an instant answer to practically any question.\n\nData is king when it comes to AI, and since Google Search has been the window to the entire internet for more than two decades, it has more valuable information than practically any company on Earth. This allowed Alphabet to develop its own AI models, culminating in its latest Gemini lineup, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4 models. In some tests, Gemini is as good, if not better, at understanding and generating text, images, videos, and computer code.\n\nGoogle also embedded generative AI into its traditional search engine, which provides the user with a text-based answer at the top of the page to save them from sifting through web results to find the information they need. Alphabet's AI initiatives are resonating with investors, who have catapulted the company into the exclusive $2 trillion club this year.\n\n5. Amazon: 3.7% of the S&P 500\n\nAmazon is best known as an e-commerce company, and online sales remain its largest source of revenue. But the company has branched out into streaming, digital advertising, robotics, and cloud computing (among other things), which have all contributed to the company's position on this list. In fact, its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the biggest in the industry, and it's home to a growing number of AI services.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy wants AWS to dominate the three layers of AI. There is the infrastructure layer, the model layer, and the application layer. To achieve this, the company now designs its own AI chips for the data center, it offers a growing portfolio of ready-made large language models (LLMs), including some it developed in-house, and it recently launched a generative AI assistant called Q, which can help businesses extract more value from the AWS platform.\n\nAmazon also uses AI in its core e-commerce platform to recommend products to customers and to help advertisers craft engaging content. Simply put, this is one of the most diversified companies an investor can own during the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "iPhone Shipments in China Soar: Are Apple Shares a Buy?",
        "content": "The ‘Magnificent 7’ group has remained in the headlines all over the past year thanks to a few members’ strong quarterly results and positive price action.\n\nNot all group members have experienced the same levels of positivity, specifically Apple AAPL, whose shares have increased just 8% over the last year compared to the broader market’s 28% gain. Uncertainties concerning China sales have bogged down performance.\n\nHowever, Apple shares have gained nearly 10% over the last month, with shares seeing a positive reaction post-earnings. And just today, Bloomberg reported that shipments of iPhones in China rose 52% last month, helping aid share performance further.\n\nGiven the favorable development, let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\n\nApple’s Latest Quarterly Results Please Investors\n\nThe technology titan posted a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales 1% ahead of expectations in its latest release, impressively reflecting its fifth consecutive double-beat.\n\nThe company experienced woes in China throughout the period, but overall, sales came in much closer to expectations relative to other periods, missing our consensus estimate by $220 million vs. a $2.5 billion miss in the previous period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotably, the tech titan announced the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. Reflecting further positivity, Apple also unveiled a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.\n\nEarnings expectations have modestly increased across the board, reflecting analysts’ optimistic view. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s earnings growth has slowed but is still expected to remain favorable, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 7% year-over-year growth. Top line growth isn’t expected to be as strong, forecasted to see a modest 0.4% bump year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith shares showing relative strength post-earnings over the last month and favorable news concerning China shipments being announced, Apple AAPL has jumped back into many watchlists.\n\nAlthough shares haven’t been as strong as those of a few of the other Mag 7 members, the company's solid fundamentals, including its strong cash-generating abilities, make it a worthy selection for many portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Apple's Defense Of App Store Fees Backfires As U.S. District Judge Calls Out Executives\n\nApple faces increasing scrutiny over its App Store fees as a U.S. District Judge raises concerns about its practices.\n\nCarson Oliver, Senior Director for Business Management for the App Store, testified before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, defending the company’s 27% commission on certain in-app purchases. However, Judge Rogers questioned the justification for this rate, citing a study commissioned by Apple that suggested a rate half of that would be more appropriate.\n\nThe court order, issued by the judge three years ago and now under scrutiny, carries significant weight for Apple’s compliance and the future landscape of online payment options. This development could potentially reshape the tech industry.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cubanand opens a round for regular investors at $250. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nThe judge’s skepticism extended to Apple Fellow Phil Schiller, who admitted that a court-ordered change to allow alternative payment systems in the App Store had not been as effective as hoped.\n\nSince January, only a tiny fraction of apps have implemented these alternative payment options. This has led Judge Rogers to openly question whether Apple is truly committed to increasing competition, as the court intended.\n\n“Did you understand the point was to increase competition?” the judge asked Oliver.\n\nThe heart of the issue lies in Apple’s decision to charge a 27% fee on sales through links clicked within apps. The fee applies even when the purchase is completed on an external website as long as it occurs within seven days of clicking the link. Developers argue that this high fee discourages them from using external payment systems, as it offers little financial incentive compared to Apple’s in-app purchase system.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nApple’s App Store policies have been the subject of ongoing legal battles in the U.S. and abroad. The company was recently fined $1.9 billion by the European Commission for antitrust violations related to its music streaming service, and it faces a $1 billion lawsuit in the UK from app developers alleging unfair App Store charges.\n\nThese legal challenges highlight the growing pressure on Apple to address concerns about its business practices and their impact on competition in the tech industry. How the company responds to these challenges will likely shape the future of the App Store and the broader landscape of digital commerce.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nInvest like a millionaire with an exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Tuesday after a rally in market darling Nvidia drove the Nasdaq to new highs, with focus remaining on upcoming inflation data and more cues on interest rates.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) extended some gains into aftermarket trade after surging some 7% during the session on hype over artificial intelligence. The stock was now nearing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second-largest listed firm on Wall Street.\n\nBut this did not translate into strength in Wall Street futures, as broader stocks remained subdued on growing caution over U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,321.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures steadied at 18,939.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,898.0 points.\n\nNvidia drives Nasdaq to record highs, but broader sentiment subdued\n\nGains in Nvidia saw the NASDAQ Composite rise 0.6% to a record high of 17,019.88 points on Tuesday. The stock was boosted chiefly by hype over AI, especially after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk raised $6 billion for his AI venture.\n\nNvidia is the third-largest stock on Wall Street, and also helped the S&P 500 close marginally higher, although the index remained well below recent peaks.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average- which is more economically sensitive than its peers, fell 0.6% to 38,852.86 points.\n\nRate jitters mount amid hawkish Fedspeak, PCE watch\n\nBroader U.S. stocks were largely subdued in anticipation of key inflation data this week. PCE price index data, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, is due this Friday, and is likely to factor into the central bank’s outlook on interest rates.\n\nBefore that, hawkish warnings from Fed officials continued to pour in. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned on Tuesday that the Fed had still not ruled out rate hikes, especially in the face of sticky inflation.\n\nMore Fed officials, including New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are set to speak before Friday’s PCE reading.\n\nThe Fed’s Beige Book report is due on Wednesday, while a revised reading on first-quarter economic growth is also due on Thursday.\n\nAfterhours movers: American Airlines dips, Robinhood jumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) sank over 6% after it cut its second-quarter earnings forecast on a more subdued outlook on travel demand.\n\nThis pulled down broader airline stocks, with Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) and Spirit Airlines Inc (NYSE:SAVE) down between 0.8% to 2.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) rose 4.3% after it unveiled a stock buyback of $1 billion.\n\nMeme stock GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) fell 1.7% after surging 25% during the session on raising $933 million in share sales.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after Nvidia rally; Fed cues in focus\n\nUS judge rejects Amazon bid to get FTC lawsuit tossed over Prime program\n\nAmid merger speculation, Brazilian airline Gol parent talks with Azul\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Growth Stock Gut Check: 7 Stocks to Sell as Valuations Veer Into the Stratosphere",
        "content": "How long will the run in growth stocks continue? The Nasdaq-100 continues to make new all-time highs seemingly almost every week. Every dip, no matter how brief, is instantly bought up as traders pile in to profit from further bullish momentum.\n\nBut trees don’t grow to the sky. At some point, the rally will end. And with the Nasdaq up more than 70% from the 2022 lows, valuations are becoming increasingly untethered from these companies’ underlying fundamentals.\n\nAs metrics such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) head to ever-loftier heights for leading growth stocks, traders should be taking a wary look toward the exits. At some point the momentum will reverse, and the ensuing selling could be swift. These are seven especially risky growth stocks to sell now while prices are still favorable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is the worldwide leader in streaming music. While streaming audio is a highly competitive market in North America, in emerging markets such as Latin America, Spotify has taken a dominant position in music streaming.\n\nThis led many investors, myself included, to think that Spotify could exhibit monopoly-like characteristics. In turn, this would allow Spotify to raise prices, hammer out better contracts with the record labels and greatly improve profit margins.\n\nI was a longtime investor in SPOT stock, but I sold my position and am now bearish simply because that thesis didn’t play out whatsoever.\n\nSpecifically, in 2018, Spotify generated a gross profit margin of 25.7%. In 2023, its gross profit margin fell to 25.6%. Despite adding hundreds of millions of users, investing heavily in content like podcasts and building its brand dramatically, Spotify wasn’t able to use that to improve the business’ economics whatsoever.\n\nThat is reflected on the bottom line as well. Spotify generated a net loss of $89 million in 2018. This ballooned to a loss of $580 million in 2023. The company has yet to generate a GAAP profit on a full-year basis. While Spotify stock has more than doubled over the past year, its underlying business economics are as fuzzy as ever.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) shares sold off sharply following a recent downbeat earnings report. Despite that, however, DUOL stock is still up dramatically in the bigger picture with shares rallying approximately 150% since the start of 2023.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Duolingo has brought a fresh and innovative approach to the language-learning arena. I live abroad and have met many fellow expats that have had positive experiences with Duolingo to help jumpstart their studies. That said, a good app isn’t necessarily a great business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is still trading at 12x enterprise value to sales, and shares are going for more than 100x forward earnings. That’s quite expensive, especially as AI translation apps and tools threaten to limit the total addressable market for Duolingo’s services.\n\nFurthermore, the free version of Duolingo’s flagship application is quite powerful, making monetization a tricky challenge as many users see no reason to upgrade. Things such as English testing certifications are interesting and could work over time, but the company will need to do more to demonstrate success.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\n25 years ago, Dell (NYSE:DELL) was a popular investment as it was at the forefront of major trends in consumer electronics hardware.\n\nThat’s no longer the case. In 2024, Dell is primarily known for being a staid IT vendor. Its business is consistent but rarely grows much, and Wall Street usually assigns it a low valuation.\n\nBut all Dell had to do was sprinkle in a touch of AI and the whole narrative has flipped. Now people have forgotten that Dell’s core business is a slow-moving one, as traders latch onto DELL as a hidden AI pick. DELL stock is now up 250% over the past 12 months and its valuation multiples are rising.\n\nMake no mistake, Dell is selling some AI enabled servers and hardware. That’s certainly useful to some extent. But reselling the latest generation of hardware is a much different position within the AI space than being the innovator creating the underlying technology. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin sees more than 60% downside for DELL stock from current levels as the hype wears off, with a fair value target of just $55 compared to today’s $160 price.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) is probably not the first name people think of as a growth stock. However, the club store operator is in the Nasdaq index, and it’s also certainly trading like a growth stock.\n\nWith shares at fresh all-time highs, Costco is now trading for more than 50 times earnings. That’s the highest valuation COST stock has achieved in decades. It’s one thing for a small start-up with a tiny revenue base to trade for 50 times earnings; it’s quite another for a dominant retailer that already has a fairly saturated store base.\n\nCostco has grown earnings per share at an 11.8% annualized clip over the past decade. That’s impressive stuff. But is it worthy of a 50x P/E ratio? Probably not.\n\nParticularly if the economy starts to roll over, Costco could be vulnerable to dramatic downside. If COST stock returned to a 30x P/E ratio — hardly a fire sale price — that would imply 40% downside on the stock from here. And if earnings dropped as well during a recession, losses could be even greater.\n\nCostco is a great business. But it’s priced for perfection right now and any sort of economic or operational hiccup could be devastating.\n\nCava Group (CAVA) Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCava Group (NYSE:CAVA) is a recent initial public offering (IPO) that has become one of the hottest growth stocks in the restaurant space. The expectation is that Cava will become the Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) of Mediterranean food.\n\nAnd at this price, it had better achieve that goal, otherwise shareholders will be left with indigestion.\n\nSpecifically, CAVA is trading at 13x revenues, 150x EBITDA, and more than 300x forward earnings. The thinking is that Cava will open far more stores around the country and grow into its valuation over time. But it’s far from assured that the same Cava menu that is so popular in major tier-1 urban areas will play as well in other parts of America.\n\nThe fast casual market dining market is far more competitive than it used to be. And inflation and economic strain are putting pressure on consumers. If Cava becomes the next Panera or Chipotle, shareholders could still make money even from today’s lofty valuation. But the more likely outcome is that Cava will see growth slow at some point — such as during a recession — and its share price will dramatically deflate.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the global leaders in the memory category of semiconductor firms.\n\nThe memory market is known for its dramatic boom/bust cycle. The memory market used to be highly competitive with more than a dozen rivals. Over time this consolidated down to a few major players, and analysts hoped that memory firms could enjoy steady consistent profitability.\n\nBut rumors of the cycle’s demise were overblown. As it would turn out, as soon as computer and smartphone demand rolled over in 2023, so did Micron’s business. The company lost a prodigious sum of money in 2023.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to return to at least breakeven results this year. But times are hardly good for Micron, with shares still trading for more than 150x forward earnings. Traders have latched onto AI as a catalyst for Micron, but its AI solutions are a fractional revenue line within its larger business.\n\nMorningstar’s William Kerwin agrees that MU stock is wildly overvalued. He believes shares are worth just $80 today, implying that the stock has 38% downside from here. Kerwin gives MU stock a 1-star rating and warns that the company has no competitive moat and faces dramatic risks from its exposure to the Chinese market.\n\nAppLovin (APP) The AppLovin (APP) info on an iPhone and laptop screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company which develops and operates a mobile marketing platform and ecosystem. It offers products such as AppDiscovery, MAX and SparkLabs.\n\nAppLovin, as the name might suggest, primarily helps mobile application developers to monetize their programs, and further boost their marketing and consumer engagement efforts.\n\nAPP stock has gone on an absolute tear over the past year with the shares rising more than 230%.\n\nInvestors are pleased that AppLovin has been able to work around some of the privacy restrictions that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other operators have put in their ecosystems. AppLovin is certainly making progress as a business and its AI ad system is also sparking investor enthusiasm.\n\nWhile AppLovin is enjoying a large increase in revenues in 2024, analysts believe this is a temporary development tied to solving particular pain points such as Apple’s privacy moves. Once the current revenue growth spurt ends, analysts see revenue growth dropping to just 12% for FY’ 25 and 11% for FY ’26. Traders are currently extrapolating AppLovin’s strong earnings results into the indefinite future, but APP stock could be in for a rude awakening once growth inevitably slows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI darling Nvidia's market value surges closer to Apple",
        "content": "By Zaheer Kachwala\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia's shares rallied around 6% to hit a record high on Tuesday, leaving the AI chipmaker's stock market value about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple in a major reshuffle of Wall street's biggest players.\n\nLast trading at $1,128, Nvidia's market capitalization reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, which is Wall Street's second-most valuable company after Microsoft.\n\nIts stock surged as much as 8% to $1,149.39 during the session, an intra-day record high. Apple's stock was down 0.2% in afternoon trading.\n\nNvidia's shares have surged nearly 13% since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split, which excited investors as they continue to bet on the AI poster child.\n\n\"The market has been struggling to keep up with the company's ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesn't feel like bubble territory,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nNvidia recently traded at 36 times its forward profit estimates, compared with 38 for Advanced Micro Devices and 21 for Intel, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company's shares have more than doubled so far this year after more than tripling last year.\n\nNvidia, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, reported a five-fold jump in revenue at its data center segment last week as customers line up for their high-performance chips.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com and other technology companies have been competing for a limited supply of Nvidia's high-end chips as they race to dominate AI computing.\n\n\"Business is doing incredibly well, there are so many opportunities to keep growing, and the AI theme still has legs. When the song is that catchy, investors want to keep humming it all day long, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell when asked about the stock's rally.\n\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple has underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling around 2% this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China.\n\nMicrosoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company earlier this year as it raced ahead of other tech firms due to gains made by early investments in artificial intelligence across its cloud services.\n\nMicrosoft's shares were down 0.4% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of $3.1 trillion.\n\nApple has also been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Evercore insights: Apple's rising growth amid China's smartphone boom",
        "content": "Investing.com - Evercore ISI recently provided a detailed look into the performance of the Chinese smartphone market, highlighting a second consecutive month of accelerating shipments.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the market saw a significant year-on-year increase of roughly 29% in April, a noteworthy improvement from the 5.5% downturn reported in March.\n\nThe data provided by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) indicates that multinational corporation (MNC) shipments, predominantly Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), rose by approximately 52% year-on-year, totalling 3.5 million units. This is a considerable acceleration compared to the 12% growth reported in March. The surge in shipments is likely a result of channel restocking after MNC shipments fell by about 27% in the first quarter.\n\nThe analysts noted that \"China's iPhone market looks to be holding up much better than feared. If China continues to hold up relatively flat we think emerging markets and the AI super cycle could result in solid growth for iPhone in FY25 and beyond.\"\n\nThis uptick in shipments should assuage investor concerns regarding Apple's market share risk in China. While Huawei is becoming increasingly competitive in the market's high end, their gains seem to be primarily at the expense of other players. Apple reported that its mainland China iPhone revenue remained stable year-on-year in the first quarter.\n\nApple has reportedly used discounting via third parties to help maintain its market share. However, these discounts appear to be relatively limited in scope, being available for approximately one week of the quarter in February and May. It remains unclear how much of the discount is provided by Apple versus third parties.\n\nEvercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating for Apple, with a target price of $220.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvercore insights: Apple's rising growth amid China's smartphone boom\n\nAmerican Airlines cuts Q2 EPS guidance; shares fall in afterhours\n\nGlobal equity index dips, yields rise with inflation data in focus\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Apple Inc. (AAPL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +9.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 12.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 points to a change of +7.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.21 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAPL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $83.07 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $384.68 billion and $405.81 billion estimates indicate +0.4% and +5.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Battered Stocks That Even Warren Buffett Could Be Eyeing",
        "content": "One of many ways legendary investor Warren Buffett has achieved great wealth is buying blue chip stocks when they are beaten down for the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B), the conglomerate he founded and heads. Buffett likes to invest in industry leaders in sectors he understands. He was leery of tech stocks and it took him a long time to load up on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), now it is his biggest holding. His portfolio reflects this outlook with another large position being Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nA large economic moat is also found in many Warren Buffett stocks. This is what protects the business from the forces of competition and time. For Coca-Cola in large part, it is the brand and all that it entails. For the railroad holdings of Buffett, it is the sprawling infrastructure that comes with a major player in the transportation sector.\n\nThe wide and deep insurance holdings of Buffett show his appreciation for the time value of money. For this, you want someone to pay you as far in advance as far as possible so you can “play the float” and profit. The most recent Buffett investment was Chubb (NYSE:CB), the insurance giant. Due to seeking to be on the profit-making side of the float, there are many other insurance companies in the portfolio and even Blue Chip Stamps, an early loyalty program that kicked off cash. Many times the money is free as it is never cashed in for the item.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBoeing (BA) image of a Boeing (BA) 737 max aircraft. stocks to buy and sell related to Boeing\n\nSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) has a wide economic moat in an industry America invented and dominates. It functions in basically a duopoly with only Airbus (OTCSMKTS:EADSY), the European multinational aerospace firm.\n\nThe allure of the aviation industry is easily understood. Just look up! What is difficult for many to fathom is Boeing’s decline. Aerospace consultant Dr. Mike Heil, who headed the Ohio Aerospace Institute, told InvestorPlace, “Boeing’s long and unfortunate decline began when their emphasis shifted from engineering and product excellence to their stock price and short term financial performance. The bean counters took over, moved the headquarters away from their engineers, and started outsourcing manufacturing and engineering to cut costs. The dire results were predictable.”\n\nWith all respect to Elon Musk and The Boring Company, his tunneling outfit, air travel will dominate the future. That makes the present decline in the stock price of Boeing is an opportunity.\n\nBoeing also goes nicely with Buffett’s investments in NetJets and railroads. NetJets is a private jet company for high-end travelers. Railroads haul bulk. Passengers and light cargo fly on Boeing planes.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) Southwest Airlines logo on aircraft that is taking off from McCarran in Las Vegas, NV.\n\nSource: Eliyahu Yosef Parypa / Shutterstock.com\n\nTraditionally, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was the dominant airline. It carried the most domestic passengers and never lost money.  Southwest is the only legacy carrier to never go bankrupt and has always posted a profit. A big reason for this is Southwest only flies the Boeing 737. As a result it is more efficient and kicks off more cash.  But it also suffers when Boeing is hurting, as it is presently. When Boeing recovers things will be much better for Southwest Airlines, too!\n\nSouthwest also fits in with NetJets and the railroads. NetJets fly affluent passengers.  Southwest is a discount airlines. Railroads carry freight and Southwest carries passengers seeking a fare cheaper than NetJets.\n\nAirlines also offer float income. Southwest sells tickets for travel a year into the future. So if you book a flight for April 2025 and pay for it today, there is almost a year of free money before having to provide the service for the payment. In addition, if Buffett were to invest in Southwest and Boeing he could work to keep Boeing as the only plane in the fleet. This would protect two of his potential investments!\n\nSouthwest took a major step recently to bring in more passengers. Previously tickets had to be bought through its website. Flights will now be displayed on Google Flight, the travel sales arm of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL). Obviously something was working before as Southwest was the leader in domestic passengers carried. Still, this is a step in the right direction of turning things around for the airline.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is more than just coffee. One meme says “Starbucks is a bank dressed up as a coffee shop” due to its loyalty program’s success. Starbucks Rewards has 34 million members who load or reload $10 billion annually.  These numbers are increasing.  This is very attractive to Buffett. Starbucks gets the money, plays the float, books investment income and delivers the goods and services later.\n\nUntil it is spent, this would be more free money for Buffett to invest.  Up to one-fifth of gift cards remain unspent and more than 5% is never used. So if $10 billion goes on Starbucks Rewards Apps yearly and 5% is never spent, the house nets $50 million annually just from those funds never used.\n\nBuffett was, at one time, one of the largest sharehlders of RJR, the cigarette maker due to the brand loyalty. He should similarly love the brand loyalty Starbucks creates for a more appealing consumer good with a high profit margin.\n\nBig Coffee could easily team up with other Buffett consumer holdings, too. Starbucks could sell Sees Candies, one of Buffet’s favorite assets, in the way McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is bringing in Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) pastries to fill a hole in its breakfast lineup. Other possibilities include Dairy Queen or Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC).\n\nThe combination could serve up tasty returns for Buffett’s portfolio!\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Recommends This Index Fund. It Could Turn $350 Per Month Into $903,800, With Help From AI Stocks.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through a litany of shrewd investments. In fact, its stock price has skyrocketed more than 4,300,000% since he took control in 1965. That accomplishment has made Buffett one of the most revered figures in the financial world.\n\nSurprisingly, Buffett has never recommended Berkshire stock. Instead, he has regularly advised investors to periodically purchase shares of an index fund that tracks the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). That strategy provides diversified exposure to hundreds of American businesses that are collectively \"bound to do well\" over time, according to Buffett.\n\nIndeed, history says investors can build an $903,800 portfolio over three decades by simply investing $350 per month in an S&P 500 index fund. Here's how.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides diversified exposure to hundreds of U.S. companies\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) measures the performance of 500 U.S. companies, a blend of value stocks and growth stocks from every market sector. The index fund covers about 80% of U.S. equities and nearly 50% of global equities by market capitalization, meaning it spreads money across many of the most influential companies in the world.\n\nOne tailwind that should send the S&P 500 higher in future years is artificial intelligence (AI). Just as e-commerce, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing drove the index higher in past years, many experts see AI as the next generation-defining investment theme. Indeed, the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (shown in the chart) are all well positioned to monetize AI in the future. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides exposure to hundreds of stocks that could benefit from artificial intelligence, including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nHere's a look at each company.\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is the largest enterprise software vendor and the second-largest cloud computing provider. The company is monetizing artificial intelligence with generative AI Copilots for its software products, and cloud AI services. Most notably, Microsoft Azure lets developers build generative AI applications with large language models from ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has cultivated brand authority across several consumer electronics verticals, and it has a particularly strong market presence in smartphones. The company undoubtedly lags its big tech peers in monetizing artificial intelligence, but upcoming versions of iOS will reportedly feature AI-powered search, summaries, photo editing, and other automations.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) offer unparalleled performance when accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence applications. The company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, and its extensive product ecosystem -- spanning hardware, software, and services -- makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for building entire AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the market leader in digital advertising and the third-largest cloud computing provider, and it's leaning into artificial intelligence across both product categories with its Gemini model. Specifically, Gemini simplifies ad campaign creation with natural language, supports the development of generative AI applications, and automates work in its office productivity suite Google Workspace.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) enjoys a leadership position in e-commerce, retail advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is using artificial intelligence across all three product categories. Rufus is an AI-powered shopping assistant, Amazon Ads offers generative AI for creating brand images, and Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service for developing generative AI applications.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 is a cheap, easy way to build wealth\n\nThe S&P 500 is a proven moneymaker. The index outperformed virtually every other asset class over the last two decades, from international equities and fixed income to real estate and precious metals, and it has been a profitable investment over every 20-year period in history.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 1,970% over the last 30 years, compounding at 10.62% annually. At that pace, $350 invested monthly would be worth $74,200 in one decade, $288,100 in two decades, and $903,800 in three decades. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but even a more conservative growth rate of 10% annually would turn $350 invested monthly into $791,000 over three decades.\n\nWarren Buffett believes \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" His logic is simple: The U.S. is the largest and arguably the most innovative economy in the world. Indeed, 16 of the 20 largest companies in the world are U.S. companies, and the U.S. stock market is by far the largest.\n\nThat makes a compelling argument for investing in U.S. stocks, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is essentially a basket of the most successful U.S. companies. Additionally, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning the annual fees will total $3 for every $10,000 invested, the index fund is a cheap and easy way to build wealth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the most densely populated country in the world in 2024. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 30 Most Densely Populated Countries in the World in 2024.\n\nAccording to a United Nations (UN) report, the global population is increasing rapidly. Having tripled in size over the past few decades, the global population is projected to reach 11 billion from the current 8 billion by the end of the century. This growth will predominantly occur in middle-class or low-income regions.\n\nKey factors driving this growth include declining mortality rates in developing countries due to improved healthcare. Moreover, fertility rates in certain countries also contribute to overall growth. While the global fertility rate has dropped from 5 in 1960 to 2.4 in 2021, countries like Niger and Angola still have high fertility rates of 6.73 and 5.76, respectively.\n\nYou can check out the 30 Most Fertile Countries in the World Heading into 2024 here.\n\nIn underdeveloped countries, population growth can also be influenced by religious values. Some religions encourage large families to support their practices, leading to high birth rates within these communities. However, this growing population can strain global resources and agriculture. The increasing population drives a higher demand for food, with reports indicating that the agricultural sector needs to boost production by 70% by 2050 to meet these rising demands.\n\nIndustry Leaders Embracing Sustainable Practices\n\nLooking at the negative impacts of high population density, some industry leaders are increasing their efforts to preserve the planet for future generations through sustainable practices. Popular companies supporting such practices include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a leading technology company offering hardware, software, and cloud services, aims to become water-positive by 2030, meaning it will replenish more water than it uses. Moreover, the company plans to achieve zero waste in its direct operations and protect ecosystems by that year. In 2020, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its sustainability goals, committing to be carbon-negative by 2030, which involves reducing more carbon emissions than it has produced since its founding in 1975.\n\nMoreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), well known for its innovative products like the iPhone, is also committed to reducing carbon emissions. Recent reports indicate that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has avoided 23 million metric tons of emissions so far, with a goal to become carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), the leading online payment platform, is taking steps to mitigate the environmental impacts of overpopulation by aiming for net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, since 2021, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has used 100% renewable energy for its global data centers.\n\nHere’s what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a long-standing holding for Wedgewood, since 2015. After taking some of our gains around the company’s COVID-19-fueled peak in 2021, we have been adding to the stock slowly over the past two years, taking it back to a signi2icant position in the portfolio.\n\nWe would like to update you on our current thinking.\n\nLike most “COVID-19 stocks”, a variety of companies (e.g., Amazon) benefited from artificially high growth rates due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent stimulus; fundamentals at PayPal saw a normalization as the world returned to normal through 2021- 2022. Similar to most of those companies, many PayPal investors had incorrectly assumed their arti2icially elevated growth rates during the COVID-19 period would continue for years and were surprised when the normalization occurred, leading to a decline in the Company’s admittedly overheated stock. The big difference between PayPal and many of these stocks (e.g., Amazon once again) is that PayPal still has not recovered from this broad normalization period…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used data from the United Nations (UN) to shortlist the 30 most densely populated countries in the world in 2024.

        "title": "1 Stock to Buy Before It Breaks New Ground in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Next Month",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the biggest driving forces behind the current bull market.\n\nIn the 18 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 33%. The AI trend has been fueled by announcements from Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and practically every other major tech company in the world. There's no doubt AI development has advanced considerably in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nOne company has been relatively quiet when it comes to what it's working on, but management promised to \"break new ground\" in generative AI this year. And those groundbreaking announcements could come in just a few weeks.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is set to take the wraps off its AI development and partnerships at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which starts June 10. Here's what investors can expect and what it means for the stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's AI ambitions are different from the rest of big tech\n\nCentral to Apple's brand is a focus on data privacy and security. As such, it'll highlight the fact that most of its AI features will work on your personal devices.\n\nApple has built its own large language model capable of features like summarizing missed notifications, providing a synopsis of a news article, or transcribing voice memos, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. It'll also improve upon existing features like auto-populating your calendar, suggesting apps, and editing photos.\n\nNone of these features are particularly groundbreaking in and of themselves. But the promise of more on-device AI capabilities down the road as Apple improves its LLM could be the bigger story. As AI features play an increasingly larger role in our digital lives, the ability to keep data private and secure with on-device processing may be the next big step forward in AI, with Apple leading the charge.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Apple knows there's huge demand for AI features it can't necessarily deliver with its current on-device capabilities. As such, it's struck a partnership deal with OpenAI to integrate some of its technology into the next iteration of iOS. It's also held talks with Google to use its Gemini model, but they have yet to come to an agreement.\n\nApple's secret weapon as it races to catch up in AI\n\nOne of the biggest limiting factors in developing AI technology is the need for compute power. Nvidia has a stranglehold on the high-end GPU market, and it can't make chips fast enough to keep up with demand. While that's been great for Nvidia's bottom line, it makes it extremely costly for big tech companies building out data centers full of Nvidia GPU clusters.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost every big tech company that's currently using Nvidia chips for their AI data centers is developing their own chips for training large language models, including Microsoft and Alphabet. But developing cutting-edge chips is hard, and getting them manufactured takes a long time.\n\nApple is using its own chips in its AI data centers, which saves it money and reduces the potential for bottlenecks other big tech companies may experience as they procure Nvidia chips and print their own. Apple is currently using the M2 Ultra chips found in the Mac Pro computer for its data centers. Next year, it could switch to the M4 chips found in the latest version of the iPad Pro released earlier this month. Its existing manufacturing relationships mean it can be very fast and cost effective in building out data centers as it ramps up its AI efforts.\n\nThe fact that it's using the same chips to train its LLM as it uses in its devices is also promising for the future of on-device AI capabilities for Apple's products.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nIt's unlikely Apple will monetize many of its new AI features directly. Instead, the new capabilities may push a large portion of Apple's 2.2 billion user base to upgrade their devices. On-device AI capabilities may only be available on the latest hardware and may encourage more device storage for all those AI-edited photos and videos.\n\nThe majority of iPhones in use in the United States are more than two years old, with about one-third of users holding their phones for three years or longer. These devices are ripe for an upgrade, especially if Apple gives iPhone owners a bit of a push. That could lead to a surge in sales for fiscal 2025, which starts in October. New iPhone models typically come out in September.\n\nMeanwhile, advanced AI capabilities built into the iPhone could open the door for developers to build new AI-powered apps. Apple could capitalize by building what analyst Dan Ives is calling an \"AI App Store.\" AI-enabled features, such as circle-to-search found on Google's Pixel phones, could drive more traffic to search engines. And Apple could see a nice boost to its services revenue if it does. Court documents revealed Apple receives a 36% cut of all of Google's search revenue on iPhones, Macs, and iPads.\n\nAI could fuel sales in the two biggest segments of Apple's business in fiscal 2025. The announcements next month could be just the start.\n\nWhile shares are approaching their all-time high again, the stock still looks attractive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio approaching 30 may curb its appeal for some, but a premium price is justified due to its massive share repurchase program, its existing net cash position, and the long-term outlook for another period of strong earnings growth next year and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple's Highly Anticipated Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reveal Could Be Only 14 Days Away. Should You Buy the Stock Now?",
        "content": "In the movie Home Alone, Macaulay Culkin's character, Kevin McCallister, was left behind to fend for himself. Some might see Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in a similar role in the race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHowever, that view could soon change. Apple's highly anticipated AI reveal could be only 14 days away. Should you buy the stock now in anticipation of a big move?\n\nMark your calendars\n\nApple's management team has been dropping hints for a while that major news related to its AI strategy was coming. CEO Tim Cook said in the company's second-quarter earnings call earlier this month that Apple is \"making significant investments\" in generative AI. He added, \"[W]e're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\"\n\nCook's comments came right after he plugged Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), scheduled to begin June 10, 2024. He gushed about this event: \"We can't wait to reveal what we have in store.\"\n\nDid Cook unequivocally state that Apple would announce new AI products at the WWDC? No. However, many Apple watchers believe the tech giant will use this conference to make a big AI splash.\n\nThe speculation is so rampant that I think Apple almost has to spill the beans, at least in part, as to what its AI plans are. With its stock languishing so far in 2024 while most of the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are up by double-digit percentages (or, in Nvidia's case, triple digits), Apple has a lot riding on convincing skeptics that it won't be left in the dust with AI.\n\nWhat Apple might announce\n\nWe'll have to wait a couple of weeks (presumably) to find out for sure what AI-related announcements Apple will make. However, there's no shortage of guesses about what's on the way.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman thinks Apple's AI strategy is three-pronged:\n\nAn on-device large-language model (LLM) A cloud-based LLM A chatbot or two\n\nGurman expects Apple to use its own LLMs for devices and the cloud. However, he believes Apple will use OpenAI's GPT-4 chatbot and perhaps also go with Alphabet's Google Gemini.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that Apple will unveil major improvements to AI assistant Siri at the WWDC. Citing sources \"familiar with the company's work,\" the newspaper said the updated version of Siri will incorporate new generative AI technology.\n\nApple routinely highlights new versions of its operating systems at the annual WWDC events. The company is expected to announce iOS 18 with significant new AI functionality, including AI assistance in the Keynote and Pages apps, AI editing tools similar to those in Android smartphones, and automatically generated Apple Music playlists.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you buy Apple stock now?\n\nBuying Apple stock now in hopes of a big bounce the week of June 10 carries three key risks. I'll discuss them in order of least concerning to most concerning.\n\nFirst, it's possible that Apple won't deliver its grand AI reveal at the WWDC. A lot of people will be shocked if that's the case, but it's not entirely out of the question. Still, I'd bet on Apple making major AI announcements in a couple of weeks.\n\nSecond, Apple could announce great new AI functionality but not have its stock move much. So many rumors are flying around about what the company will unveil that they could already be largely baked into the share price. With Apple trading at a forward earnings multiple of 29 yet posting a year-over-year revenue decline of 4% in its latest quarter, there's no question that investors are banking on something to jump-start growth.\n\nThird, Apple's new AI offerings could be underwhelming. If this happens (and I absolutely wouldn't rule it out), look for Apple stock to take a pounding.\n\nWith these risks in mind, I don't think investors should buy shares of Apple solely to profit from a potential short-term, AI-related catalyst. That said, I'm cautiously optimistic about the company's long-term prospects. With over 2 billion devices in use worldwide, Apple should be in a prime position to dominate edge AI -- the use of AI on devices where data is created rather than in the cloud. We'll hopefully learn more about how Apple plans to conquer this market in 14 days.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "It's more complicated than ever to watch sports — here's why",
        "content": "Let's say you want to watch the entire upcoming NFL season. You'll need to subscribe to quite a few platforms to even come close.\n\nFor starters, you'll need access to traditional pay-TV channels like Fox (FOXA), CBS (PARA), NBC (CMCSA), and ESPN (DIS). You'll also need to subscribe to over-the-top streaming services including Netflix (NFLX), NBCUniversal's Peacock, Disney's ESPN+, and Amazon Prime Video (AMZN).\n\nAnd if you want to watch games not airing in your local area? Google's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) has the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\nThe NFL season is just one example of how fragmented the sports landscape has become as legacy media players and more recently tech giants compete for pricey media rights deals. The reason: Sports content is highly desired by media companies looking to gain access to massive audiences of loyal viewers. That allows sports leagues to bid up the price of rights in negotiations.\n\n\"The sports leagues are just taking advantage and trying to get as much as they can,\" Jon Christian, head of digital media supply chain at media consulting company Qvest, told Yahoo Finance. \"They do not want to do just an exclusive deal with one partner. They want to have the diversification.\"\n\nThe MLB has national television contracts with broadcasters including ESPN, Fox, and TBS (WBD). Connected TV platform Roku (ROKU) recently acquired the rights to \"Sunday Leadoff,\" which broadcasts MLB games primarily held on Sunday afternoons.\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA is in deep negotiations for its next media rights package that could fetch up to $75 billion.\n\nThe league's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network and Disney's ESPN expires at the end of next season, although rumors have swirled WBD could lose the media rights to NBCUniversal. Amazon is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through Prime Video.\n\nEven college sports have seen increased fragmentation. Just this past week, Warner Bros. secured a handful of College Football Playoff games in a five-year deal with ESPN.\n\n'War of eyeballs' Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (0) puts up a shot against Indiana Pacers guard T.J. McConnell (9) in overtime of Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference basketball finals, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe competitive land grab for sports is not all that different from years past. What's changed is the players.\n\nVarious networks within the cable bundle frequently fought over the rights to air certain games, as it helped boost viewership as well as affiliate fees, or fees pay-TV providers give network owners to carry their channels.\n\nThe introduction of streaming massively altered the playing field. Not to mention the deep pockets of Big Tech.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What we have now is still that old model plus this new model, so the fragmentation looks much more severe,\" Christian said, describing the current media landscape as a \"war of eyeballs.\" Additionally, \"there is a lot more revenue to be had in terms of rights because you can separate rights between traditional linear broadcast versus digital and get even more money in that way.\"\n\nTo that point, the industry has seen more à la carte deals with streamers amid the leagues' push for diversification.\n\nNetflix, for instance, will host two Christmas Day NFL games this year as part of a three-season deal with the league. The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSimilarly, Peacock will host one exclusive in-season game after it aired an exclusive wild card playoff game this past season. The platform, which paid a reported $110 million for the rights to the playoff game, saw a significant lift in subscribers as a result.\n\nOn the surface, the moves seem like a win-win for both streamers and sports leagues.\n\nBut the experience might not be so great for consumers. The fragmentation means more money, more subscriptions, and more confusion over when, where, and how to watch.\n\nAmid the chaos, certain leagues have approached media rights differently. Major League Soccer, for example, strategically consolidated all of its rights in order to land an exclusive, one-package deal with Apple (AAPL) in 2022.\n\nThere's also been a rise in streaming bundles as media companies look to consolidate costs, reduce churn, and tilt the power away from Big Tech.\n\n\"These platforms are trying to break down the barriers of use [but] it's not necessarily one bill you're paying,\" Christian said. \"This is where users are going to get frustrated. But if you're a fan of a team or sport, you're going to figure out a way to get it.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) boom has continued to pick up speed, with GPU firm Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) once again leading the way. The company’s latest quarterly blowout sent shares soaring nearly 10% while the rest of the market sunk lower. Undoubtedly, there’s still plenty of gas in the AI engine, even if the market is starting to lose a bit of steam after a robust springtime rally.\n\nNot all companies have been able to gain traction on the back of AI tailwinds, however. Even the companies spending time and money to bolster their footing in AI may have seen little upside action in their share prices, at least so far.\n\nIt can be tempting to dismiss such tech firms as “being left behind in the AI boom.” That said, I view the biggest gains from such AI bets as coming in gradually over the next six years and beyond. You see, AI won’t be an overnight shot in the arm for every firm.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMany companies playing the long game with AI will be rewarded in due time. For investors with long enough time horizons, I believe the following lagging tech stocks will be well worth the wait.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech juggernaut that comes to mind when one thinks of firms that haven’t really taken off at the hands of an AI boom. In my opinion, Apple may be playing possum when it comes to its AI capabilities.\n\nIn a recent sit-down with CNBC, Steve Eisman, the investment legend behind The Big Short, referred to Apple as a “hidden AI play.” He thinks once the AI apps arrive, consumers will buy AI devices, perhaps kicking off the start of an AI-driven refresh cycle. That’s some bullish commentary from one of the smartest investors out there. And I think he’ll be proven right about AAPL stock over the next 18 months.\n\nBuild the AI apps, and they will come.\n\nAlso, the new Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Copilot+ PCs represent a potential competitive threat to the Mac if Apple can’t make the most of its powerful M4 chip from an application standpoint. The M4 neural engine is powerful, but it also needs to be more useful for a wider range of applications.\n\nThough I’m not entirely sure if AI PCs will be in high demand this year, next year or sometime later, I think it’s safe to say that Apple will eventually be ready to make a huge splash in AI. Either way, the Apple AI rumor mill has been rotating at increasing speed lately.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is a data warehousing company that’s remarkably pivoted towards generative AI in recent quarters. With Sridhar Ramaswamy, a new face running the business, and a number of small but smart moves made to bolster Snowflake’s AI software suite, it’s clear Snowflake is serious about harnessing AI to power growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith strong strategic partnerships with some of the world’s AI leaders (like Nvidia and Mistral AI) and a growing appetite for bite-sized AI startup acquisitions, I view SNOW stock as one of the lesser-appreciated AI companies that could enjoy AI-related upside gradually over the next five years.\n\nSnowflake’s recent $1 billion pursuit of Reka AI has fallen through, but look for the firm to spend the money elsewhere as it looks to wheel and deal on AI. The way I see it, SNOW stock is a bargain after falling over 5% after some impressive quarterly results. It won’t stay grounded in the AI race forever.\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another tech titan whose AI innovations may be vastly overlooked. Today, CSCO stock is down over 26% from its 2021 highs, and the negative momentum seems to be picking up speed, even after the firm reported quarterly sales that weren’t nearly as bad as they could have been. The guidance wasn’t bad either, but it seems like investors have had enough of the network equipment maker and the relative lack of timely AI catalysts.\n\nLike it or not, Cisco has been improving its slate of products with AI. With a useful AI assistant brought to the Webex suite and its Security Operations Center (SOC), Cisco seems to be following in the footsteps of many other firms by enhancing existing offerings with AI.\n\nIn the meantime, investors seem less impressed with the AI additions, but I expect such efforts will translate to growth eventually. At 15.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), CSCO stock is quite cheap (and bountiful with a 3.43% dividend yield) for a “hidden” AI play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Snowflake.

        "title": "40% of Warren Buffett's $379 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "No one in the investing world is as closely watched as Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha's fantastic track record allocating capital at Berkshire Hathaway has made him an investing legend whose portfolio holdings are considered potential buying opportunities for individuals.\n\nOne of Buffett's biggest wins in recent times is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire first invested in the \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in the first quarter of 2016. And from the start of that year to May 21 of this year, shares have soared 631%. Apple now represents a jaw-dropping 40% of Berkshire's entire portfolio.\n\nContinue reading to learn what factors probably caught Buffett's attention with this business. Then, investors can assess if the stock is a smart buy today.\n\nPassing Buffett's test\n\nLooking back, it's not too difficult to figure out why Buffett was drawn to Apple. While he's someone who typically stayed away from tech-focused enterprises, his thinking centered on the fact that Apple was a powerful consumer brand more than anything. This was the key to its success.\n\nThat brand has helped Apple flex its pricing power, a characteristic that Buffett believes makes a business great. Consumers seem to always be willing to pay up for the company's expensive hardware products, even if the newest updates aren't that revolutionary. Overall, the business carried a superb gross margin of 40% in fiscal 2015, the year before Buffett purchased shares.\n\nCustomer loyalty is another trait that can't be ignored. In Apple's case, the combination of well-designed products with easy-to-use software and services creates an ecosystem that essentially results in consumer lock-in.\n\nBuffett is known for practicing patience as he waits for the so-called fat pitch. During the first quarter of 2016, Apple shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6, which, in hindsight, looks like an absolute steal. I think the market might have been worried that iPhone growth was stalling at the time, leading to a pressured valuation multiple.\n\nHowever, like the independent thinker that he is, Buffett realized that Apple was still an incredibly profitable business. It posted a 30% operating margin in fiscal 2015 while generating $70 billion in free cash flow that year.\n\nEven better, Apple was in pristine financial shape. As of Dec. 26, 2015, the company had $216 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the books, compared to $56 billion in long-term debt.\n\nThanks to its so many wonderful traits, Apple was a no-brainer investment decision for Warren Buffett.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it too late to buy Apple stock?\n\nAs we look at Apple today from a fresh perspective, I think investors will come to a different conclusion. After years of strong share performance, this business sports a market cap of $2.9 trillion. And the stock isn't cheap by any means.\n\nRight now, Apple trades at a P/E ratio of 29.7. This is way more expensive than its trailing-10-year average. While Berkshire is still a sizable shareholder, I doubt Buffett would buy the stock at the current valuation.\n\nGiven its massive scale, it's easy to argue that Apple has limited growth prospects, at least not remotely close to what it achieved in the past. The company has reported a year-over-year revenue drop in five of the past six fiscal quarters. Consensus analyst estimates believe sales will rise at an annualized clip of just 4.6% through fiscal 2026.\n\nThe iPhone was launched about 17 years ago, but it's still important, accounting for half the revenue in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024, which ended March 30). As it's in a very mature stage of its lifecycle, it's hard to encourage consumers to continue upgrading to the newest devices. Unless Apple can introduce a game-changing new product that can move the financial needle, it's best to temper expectations.\n\nApple has turned out to be a huge winner for Berkshire. But investors should think twice before buying shares today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\niPhone ‘turning the corner with AI-driven supercycle’ - Wedbush\n\nWedbush analysts said recent Asia supply chain checks indicate stabilization for Apple’s iPhone, which has been grappling with a slowdown in sales for months.\n\nIn their note, the investment firm raised its price target for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock from $250 to $275, noting that the stabilization is a very positive sign as the company approaches a significant iPhone 16 upgrade cycle.\n\nSpecifically, iPhone demand is \"turning the corner into an AI-driven iPhone 16 supercycle,\" which is now on the horizon, wrote Wedbush.\n\n\"We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring ample monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share to the Cupertino growth story as the vision starts to play out within the golden installed base of 2.2 billion iOS devices.\"\n\nWedbush said its recent checks in Taiwan imply that April results for Apple's supply chain were 2% ahead of historical linearity, while consensus remained unchanged.\n\n\"Outperforming during April was perhaps helped by inventory build ahead of China's holidays in May and June, though analysts have also seen a slight lift in Chinese handset build projections for the June quarter,\" says the firm.\n\nWedbush also expects Apple to lay the foundation for an AI App Store at the WWDC event in June, leading to significant Services growth over the coming years.\n\nMicrosoft to shape wider GenAI adoption - Goldman Sachs\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to lead in democratizing Gen-AI adoption, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note this week, commending the company’s innovations across the tech stack following the Build event.\n\nGoldman highlighted that Microsoft’s extensive offerings for both businesses and consumers position the company “to define how AI evolves into a more broadly used technology.”\n\nOver the last 18 months, Microsoft has expanded its early innovations, putting a greater emphasis on cost efficiency from infrastructure to applications and hardware.\n\nAnalysts believe that the Windows maker is laying the foundational components to ensure the long-term relevance of new technologies.\n\n“For this reason, the company’s announcements - from Copilot extensions, to the distillment of foundation models and AI-enabled PCs - we expect Microsoft to be able to sustain its first-mover advantage to continue to be a dominant player in the age of Gen-AI,” analysts wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley upgrades Micron stock, says staying negative was ‘a mistake’\n\nIn a note to clients released Monday, analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their rating on Micron (NASDAQ:MU) shares, hinting that the memory chipmaker could issue “a positive preannouncement” this quarter.\n\nThe Wall Street firm upgraded MU stock from Underweight to Equal Weight, acknowledging that they had overestimated the impact of significant losses in 2023 on the company's valuation and underestimated the economic and narrative aspects of AI memory.\n\n“Remaining negative for too long on MU was a mistake. We still are not positive, but we should have foreseen the fundamental and narrative implications of the strength in AI specialty memory,” analysts wrote.\n\nThe analysts also raised their 12-month target price for the stock from $98 to $130.\n\n“We still see MU as fundamentally overvalued on long term DCF metrics But HBM continues to drive sentiment from memory buyers, leading to sustained pricing strength; could see positive preannouncement this quarter HBM supply may prove excessive in the end but we are still in ramp phase.”\n\nNvidia has ANET in its sights with its AI-optimized Ethernet solution - Rosenblatt\n\nLast month, analysts at Rosenblatt Securities downgraded shares of Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) to Sell, voicing concerns that Nvidia would emerge as a key Ethernet competitor to the networking company.\n\nAlthough Arista recently said it still does not view NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a direct threat, analysts at Rosenblatt believe that the AI chipmaker has established itself as a significant Ethernet player during its latest earnings call.\n\n“Nvidia began shipping Spectrum X Ethernet Networking in 1Q25. The solution is optimized for AI and, like Infiniband, is designed for the network to be a key part of the AI compute fabric,” analysts wrote.\n\n“This is fundamentally different from what networks have been asked to do in the past, likely providing Nvidia with performance and competitive advantages over network-centric Ethernet players like ANET and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),” they added.\n\nMoreover, Rosenblatt said that Spectrum-X, Nvidia’s advanced networking platform designed to enhance data center performance for AI workloads, continues to gain traction with multiple customers, including a 100,000 GPU cluster.\n\nThe investment firm anticipates that this platform will evolve into a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\n\nAI PC war seen as positive for ARM, says BofA\n\nBank of America this week discussed the implications of the AI PC war on chipmakers, pointing out potential positive outcomes for some companies.\n\nTo be specific, the bank’s analysts see benefits for Arm Holdings ADR (NASDAQ:ARM), while the implications are neutral for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThey explained that combining new ARM-based CPUs with greater power efficiency and high NPU TOPS count, along with new Windows software specifically optimized for ARM, Microsoft claims their new Copilot+ PCs are 58% faster than the current ARM-based MacBook Air and significantly more power efficient than Intel and AMD-based PCs.\n\n\"While next iterations of Intel/AMD processors should catch up in AI/NPU performance, we flag increased competition for PC CPUs overall, with Arm expected to take share (12% unit share in CY26E vs. just 2% in CY20) from x86 incumbents INTC/AMD,\" analysts wrote.\n\n\"Still, we expect AI PCs to carry ~10% ASP upliſt, or 20% upliſt for core component (like CPUs) vendors, offsetting some of the share loss.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: iPhone demand at a turning point amid AI-driven supercycle\n\nAircraft hit by severe turbulence returns to Singapore, local media reports\n\nTesla shareholders advised to reject Musk's $56 billion pay\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is indeed Warren Buffett's favorite Dow stock as his firm, Berkshire Hathaway owns 789,368 million of the company shares worth $135.361 billion as of the first quarter of 2024. However, we recently identified the best Dow stocks according to hedge funds, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) takes the 5th spot on our list of Best Dow Stocks. To view the number 1 Dow stock to buy now, go to 8 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOn May 17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed out at record highs, crossing the 40,000 milestone for the first time ever. However, this was a little shortlived as the index is down nearly 2.35% since that day, as of May 23. While the index seems to be underperforming the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, it doesn’t fully cover the market conditions like the latter two. Nevertheless, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ’s performance is mostly dominated by mega-cap tech stocks, especially NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which isn’t a part of the Dow Jones index.\n\nDow Bucks Trend, Falls Despite NVIDIA's Upbeat News\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported its first-quarter 2025 earnings on May 22. Despite record numbers, the market failed to rally along with the company. This includes the Dow Jones index as all 30 of its components ended the day in red on May 23, including some of the best Dow stocks that are direct AI beneficiaries such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nIn its Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) generated a revenue of $26.04 billion, which was up over 262% year-over-year and surprised the consensus estimates by $1.45 billion. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $6.12, an over 460% increase year-over-year. Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10 for 1 split, which will take effect on June 7. For the second quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects a revenue of $28.0 billion. The company predicts that the automotive sector will emerge as the leading enterprise vertical within its Data Center division in the current year. At its Q1 2025 earnings call, the company’s CFO, Colette Kress said:\n\n“Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla’s expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter reporting stellar earnings, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price crossed the $1000 mark for the first time and was 9.3% higher in a day, at the May 3 market close. Nevertheless, the company failed to rally the market with it as the S&P 500 was down almost 0.75% during the same period, the NASDAQ-composite recorded a decline of 0.4% and the Dow Jones index experienced its worst day in almost 14 months declining by over 1.5%.\n\nJim Cramer: Celebrating the 40K Milestone\n\nEven though the Dow Jones index is underperforming other indices in 2024, CNBC Mad Money host, Jim Cramer still believes in celebrating its 40,000 points milestone. On May 20, he urged the investors to appreciate the market's progress despite past downturns. Cramer emphasized that while the Dow does not fully represent the market like the S&P 500, it reflects a team effort across various sectors, which should have been demolished by the challenges they faced, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, inflation, and supply chain issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, yet they thrived. He acknowledged the potential for market declines but stressed the importance of recognizing the achievements of these stocks and companies over the years.\n\nCramer mentioned that he started as a summer associate in 1983 at Goldman Sachs when the Dow was just over 1000 points, the market was full of bears in multiple sectors but the stock market “left them behind.” He added that the index going from 1000 to 40,000 shows the strength of these companies and that they “will make you money.”\n\nIn light of these comments, some of the best Dow stocks include Amazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "British microchip plant faces closure after Apple pulls the plug",
        "content": "Semiconductor chips are seen on a printed circuit board\n\nOne of Britain’s largest microchip plants is facing potential closure after Apple pulled the plug on a lucrative supply deal.\n\nAccounts filed by the US semiconductor company Coherent, which owns a 310,000 sq ft facility in County Durham, revealed that the loss of its main customer had put the factory’s future in jeopardy.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph understands that the plant manufactures components for Apple that feature in the iPhone’s Face ID recognition system, but that the US giant is believed to have ceased orders due to upcoming changes to the next version of the iPhone.\n\nCoherent’s UK subsidiary said that the business was in doubt and undergoing a strategic review that could lead to the plant being sold. It said it had issued a last-time-buy notice to other customers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Unfortunately the supply to the primary customer ceased at the end of Financial Year 2023,” it said. “This places the ongoing viability of the business in doubt. A strategic review of the business is currently being undertaken with potential new technologies and/or sale of the business as options under consideration.”\n\nThe facility laid off more than 100 staff a year ago after Apple informed the company it planned to cease orders. The remaining 257 staff have been kept on to see through the remaining contracts.\n\nClosure would mark the latest blow to Britain’s semiconductor industry, which has dwindled in recent years as global production moves to Asia.\n\nThe Coherent facility in Newton Aycliffe was originally built by Fujitsu and described as the world’s most advanced microelectronics plant when it was opened by Queen Elizabeth in 1991.\n\nBut the Japanese company announced plans to close the plant in 1998 amid an electronics industry slump. It has since cycled through a succession of owners including a microchip firm backed by Roman Abramovich before it was sold to II-VI, a US company that later merged with Coherent.\n\nIn 2021, the company announced a major expansion of the site, which is believed to have been related to winning the Apple contract. Accounts for the year to June 2023 showed that the UK factory’s revenues rose from £13.3m to £104.5m as the supply agreement came into force.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone’s Face ID system features an array of sensors and cameras used to unlock the phone and authenticate payments, as well as produce more accurate photos and augmented reality effects.\n\nApple is expected to overhaul the system in the next generation of device, which is released later this year. Reports have claimed that it will feature a much smaller module buried under the screen.\n\nLosing a contract from Apple can often be disastrous for the company’s suppliers. The British semiconductor company Imagination Technologies lost half of its value and was eventually sold after Apple said it no longer planned to use the company’s graphics chip designs in 2017. Other companies including Volex and Wolfson Microelectronics suffered share price plunges after losing contracts.\n\nThe Government announced a £1bn semiconductor strategy last year but critics say the money is not supporting the industry and pales in comparison to semiconductor subsidies in the US and Europe.\n\nApple did not comment, while Coherent did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before June 10?",
        "content": "Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have fallen behind the return of the broader market over the last year. One of the issues weighing the stock is the perception that other tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft are pulling ahead of the iPhone maker in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBut Apple is expected to finally reveal its AI plans at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10. Investors seem to be already pricing in positive news around the company's AI initiatives, with shares up 16% in just the last month. Let's look at how AI-enabled iPhones could benefit Apple, then consider what it means for the stock.\n\nApple's AI opportunity\n\nApple is very aware of the enormous opportunity to sell more devices with AI, and it's putting big money behind it. The company has invested over $100 billion in research and development over the last five years, and it's reportedly spending over $1 billion per year on AI research specifically. AAPL Research and Development Expense (TTM) Chart\n\nBut Apple is not throwing money around. Management's commentary on the last earnings call suggests it is being very deliberate with how it is investing in this technology.\n\nOn the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said, \"We have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners.\" This approach will allow Apple to deliver new AI services to customers without having to put up the cost to build out a multibillion AI infrastructure all on its own.\n\nApple is exploring bringing some AI features to iPhone from third parties like Google. It has reportedly been in discussions with Alphabet about bringing generative AI to iPhones. Licensing some technology from Google, which has already built a sophisticated AI model with Gemini, would be a cost-effective strategy for adding specific software tools in iOS.\n\nWhere it makes sense for Apple to invest internally is the hardware side. Apple is reportedly building its own chips that will run basic AI tasks locally on the iPhone without sending user data to cloud servers.\n\nUnlike Microsoft and Google, which are offering certain AI services to customers through subscription plans to directly monetize the technology, Apple can use AI to push more sales of premium iPhone models.\n\nThe next version of iOS is expected to feature several AI improvements. It would make iOS 18 the biggest update in years, but some of these features will likely require Apple's most advanced mobile chip to use. It would encourage customers still using older iPhones to upgrade to the current model, which would boost Apple's revenue and margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs the stock a buy?\n\nThe Wall Street consensus has Apple's earnings reaching $8.01 per share in fiscal 2026. Assuming Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio stays the same, investors are looking at only 30% upside based on those estimates.\n\nHowever, these projections may underestimate the impact that AI will have on iPhone demand. Investors are basically getting a fairly valued stock with the potential to surprise to the upside.\n\nAll told, given the stock's recent underperformance, now could be the right time to buy shares ahead of Apple's upcoming AI splash. Investors should remember that diversification is key to managing risk in their portfolios. While Apple's potential in AI is promising, it's smart to balance investments across different sectors and companies to mitigate any potential downturns. And you should consider many potential investment ideas within the AI market, too.\n\nAlways consider your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stocks That Have Created Many Millionaires, and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite index has climbed about 118% over the last five years despite the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic downturn in 2022. The figure illustrates how lucrative investing in certain companies and holding even amid poor market conditions can be.\n\nConsequently, it's not a bad idea to invest in some of the Nasdaq Composite's most prominent players with plans to hold over many years. As the world's second and sixth most valuable companies, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options.\n\nThese companies dominate their respective industries and have created many millionaires over the years, with Apple's stock up 319% since 2019 and Amazon's up 96%. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon have some exciting developments in the pipeline that could deliver major gains in the coming years.\n\nSo, here are two magnificent stocks that have created millionaires and will continue to make more.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOne of the most attractive aspects of Amazon is its thoroughly diverse business model. The company is best known as a king of e-commerce, with its leading 38% market share in the industry. Amazon's dominance in online retail is demonstrated by Walmart's second-largest market share in e-commerce, responsible for just 6% of the sector.\n\nAmazon's retail business remains a lucrative venture, with revenue in its North America and International segments rising 12% year over year and 10% in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, retail operating income achieved a combined $6 billion, significantly improving on the negative $349 million it posted in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHowever, Amazon is a lot more than e-commerce. The company is home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which reported sales growth of 17% year over year in Q1 2024 (its largest rise in a year). AWS' operating income rose 84% to more than $9 billion during the quarter, with the cloud service responsible for 62% of Amazon's total operating income despite earning the lowest portion of revenue between its three main segments.\n\nIn addition to stellar retail and cloud growth, Q1 2024 suggested that the company could have a lucrative future in digital advertising -- a market predominantly dominated by Alphabet and Meta Platforms. The quarter saw revenue from advertising services soar 24%, with much of that growth thanks to the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service.\n\nAmazon's stock trades at about 40 times its forward earnings, indicating that it's not exactly a bargain. However, the company's stock has already risen 20% year to date. Alongside significant growth potential in multiple markets, Amazon's stock is likely worth its premium price tag and could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple has a long history of providing loyal investors with consistent and significant gains. However, repeated hits to its business and concerns over product sales have seen its stock decline 1% since the start of 2024. The company's long-term relevancy has been questioned as product sales dipped and crucial markets like China increasingly prefer domestic offerings over Apple's.\n\nYet, Apple is making moves to boost its product business with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, a rapidly expanding services business is gradually allowing the company to depend less on product sales.\n\nShares in Apple have popped 16% in the last month, almost entirely thanks to its expanding efforts in AI. The company rallied investors in early May when it debuted its newest iPad Air. The tablet is the first device to use Apple's most powerful chip yet, the M4, which is said to vastly expand the company's AI capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, Apple plans to revamp its Mac lineup and aspects of its smartphones to better cater to the rising demand for AI services.\n\nDespite recent headwinds, Apple remains a behemoth in consumer tech. Billions of consumers continue to choose its products over rival devices, giving the company ample opportunity to tout its AI products.\n\nIn addition to a solid outlook in AI, Apple's digital services division is booming. In the second quarter of 2024 (ended March 2024), the segment posted revenue growth of 14% year over year, significantly outperforming all other segments. The trajectory of services is promising for Apple's future as it allows the company to lean less on its products' business over time, fortifying it against macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, there might be better-valued options than Apple. However, the figure is significantly lower than Amazon's 40 and Microsoft's 36, potentially making Apple one of the best-valued AI stocks. In addition to a potent position in tech, Apple is worth considering right now and one that could make you a millionaire.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "With the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2% so far over the week of May 20, all of the Dow 30 stocks have taken a dip. For the average layman, this means the broader stock market contracted this week, but most professional investors would defer to the S&P 500 which is down an average of 0.74% in the same timeframe. In either case, the bubble-like growth of the last few weeks has cooled, as retail and institutional investors alike gauge their comfort with current stock prices. This could mean that there are some Dow stocks to buy on the dip before another potential rally in June, before major Q2 earnings reports.\n\nWhile some outlets are stating the market is strong and bearish concerns are unfounded, other analysts assert that the market is objectively overvalued due to hype trains like artificial intelligence (AI). From my perspective, a generous correction is due, simply because the U.S. economy runs on consumption, yet its average consumers are running out of fiat currency to consume with. Furthermore, there’s a good chance all of the stocks in the Dow 30 have a long way to go down in the event of a crash, so time your investments wisely.\n\nThere’s only so much money to go around.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDow Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Cisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nSo far, the AI bubble has slowed in growth, with many investors recognizing that not every business has an application for AI. In the case of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) the company had some well-founded claims for its AI-driven rallies in Fall 2023 but has been on the downtrend ever since. Its earning reports have been in the red lately, further exacerbating fears of a further dip.\n\nHowever, it’s important to recognize the reality of Cisco’s business model and strengths. At its core, Cisco is a network provider, and the company cannot grow unless global development allows it to. In other words, Cisco goes through periods of waiting for new customers to become available.\n\nThat’s because not every country’s economy or business is strong enough to justify working with Cisco. Not everyone needs elite cybersecurity or cloud services, at least not yet. Once the opportunities open back up, Cisco will likely be on the up and up again.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nI recently recommended that investors avoid Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) back at the end of April. Since then, the stock has dipped another generous 13%, confirming that sell rating. From the lens of which Dow stocks to buy on the dip, however, such a low-priced Intel is starting to look more interesting.\n\nStory continues\n\nA big issue for Intel has been the recent shift in architectural standards for computer chips. Ever since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) went its own way for building central processors using ARM architecture, designed by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), Intel’s x86 architecture offerings have struggled to keep up in computing speeds versus heat and power efficiency.\n\nHowever, Intel’s ARM-based chip offerings are still in the works and could spell a long-term win for the company once software support for ARM architectures broadens, and most developers still code operating systems and applications for x86 chips.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has shown extensively lackluster performance over the last five years, growing only 7.81% since May 2019. Moreover, due to controversies around the safety and efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine, investors missed out on the surge in value its competitor saw. Yet, that may have been for the best in terms of long-term returns, as it avoided a volatile price gouge and sell-off post-pandemic.\n\nHowever, the market dynamics and overall business model of JNJ have changed significantly since its $40 billion split-off of Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE). Today, the company is refocused as a pure-play in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, meaning it will take some time for its price to recover.\n\nThus, the current dip represents the early trading price of a newly specialized company, despite JNJ’s long-running blue-chip and Dow status. However, JNJ is likely to be disproportionately affected by a large market crash, so should one occur soon, beware of the risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Is Jim Cramer Right About This Apple Catalyst?",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has a mammoth valuation near $3 trillion. It's one of the most valuable companies in the world, trailing only rival Microsoft in market cap. But many analysts and investors remain optimistic that the business can become even more valuable in the future.\n\nOne of them is CNBC's Jim Cramer. What might surprise you, however, is the reason for his optimism. It's not due to a new iPhone coming out or the company's plans to launch a chatbot, or even the strength of its services business. It involves an area of Apple's business that remains unproven.\n\nCould Apple's Vision Pro be an underrated growth opportunity?\n\nApple's Vision Pro virtual reality headsets became available for U.S. consumers earlier this year. But with a price tag that starts at $3,499, it's steep even for Apple customers who are used to paying top dollar for its devices.\n\nCramer, however, believes it's a huge opportunity for the business, one that could be an enormous moneymaker for Apple in the years ahead.\n\nThe problem is that he believes the headset should be targeted to businesses. Using digital twins, the device could help in industrial settings to reduce waste and test out changes before actually deploying them at factories. It could promote sales by allowing business customers to view large items (e.g., cars) before placing orders for them, avoiding on-site visits and costly travel.\n\nWith so much potential for the headsets, Cramer believes that they could be considered cheap for enterprise customers.\n\nThe Vision Pro remains unproven, however\n\nThe demand for headsets isn't strong, at least not yet. Apple has reportedly slashed its forecast for the Vision Pro headsets drastically, according to an analyst who covers the company. From an estimate of 700,000 to 800,000 units sold this year, Apple is now expecting a far lower range, between 400,000 and 450,000 units.\n\nBy comparison, rival Meta Platforms has sold tens of millions of its Quest headsets, but it has had to reduce prices along the way. These days, consumers can buy a Quest headset for just a few hundred dollars. It might be a hard sell, even for businesses, to justify paying a significant premium for Vision Pro headsets even if they do think they are superior.\n\nAnd while there is a potential market for business buyers, I think Cramer is overplaying it. Companies don't need high-priced headsets to review large purchases or to do what-if scenarios.\n\nPlus, adoption of the headsets would change business processes, requiring user training, and additional software could be needed to integrate them with a company's existing systems. It likely wouldn't be as simple as just strapping on a headset and continuing with regular workflows. There are extra costs and resource constraints to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a good stock to buy, but not because of the Vision Pro\n\nApple's Vision Pro headsets certainly have the potential to be an exciting new product for the tech company, but even if they are successful, the headsets might not make a big difference in the company's earnings.\n\nApple has generated a mammoth $382 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months. For the Vision Pro to account for even 1% of the top line, the company would need to sell more than 1 million of them per year at their current price tag. That could be a tall task, especially when Meta's devices might offer a much cheaper alternative for prospective buyers.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to like Apple. It has a loyal following of customers, its services business continues to grow and generate record sales, and the company gushes cash and recently announced an incredible $110 billion stock buyback plan.\n\nThose are all reasons to remain bullish on the company. The Vision Pro could prove to be a good bet for Apple, but it's far too early to expect that to be a significant growth driver for the business in the long haul, and investors should be careful not to set their expectations too high.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks That Could Be Millionaire-Makers: May Edition",
        "content": "As an expression of the digital age, the metaverse comes in many forms depending on investor focus. One could view it as supplemented or displaced reality via augmented reality/virtual reality headsets like Meta Platform’s (NASDAQ:META) Oculus Quest or Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. As we delve deeper into this realm, identifying promising metaverse stocks to buy becomes crucial. The app ecosystem, which forms the baseline for metaverse content, offers numerous opportunities for savvy investors to capitalize on this evolving market.\n\nMetaverse could also be viewed as the totality of different components. In addition to augmented reality, it would bring in tradeable digital assets from various blockchain networks. This would form a new layer of the economy conducted in virtual space.\n\nOn top of it, artificial intelligence (AI) agents would then bring an additional layer of immersion for people to interact with e-commerce, gaming and social networking. According to a Mordor Intelligence report, the metaverse market size is about $116 billion in 2024. By 2029, it is forecasted to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41.83% to $670 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is, which are the metaverse stocks to buy that will power this growth to the benefit of shareholders?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a chipmaker in competition with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is seldom viewed as a metaverse stock. However, if this market is to gain mass adoption, AMD will play a key role.\n\nKnown for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) that are also competitively priced, AMD is now pushing accelerated processing units (APUs) further. These chips combine both central processing and parallel graphics in a single package. Since the introduction of Fusion APU in 2011, these chips now rival modern gaming consoles with the Ryzen 8000G series.\n\nIn other words, AMD is opening the way for cheap mini PCs that don’t require expensive and bulky discrete GPUs. In that capacity, AMD is creating all-purpose computing platforms which is exactly what the baseline metaverse layer would need.\n\nInterestingly, the financial markets have shown a mixed reaction to AMD’s innovations and market positioning. Over the last year, AMD’s stock increased by around 66%, reflecting investor optimism about its role in emerging technologies. However, Nvidia saw a substantial rise of around 188% largely due to its dominance in AI technologies. AMD, on the other hand, has not gained as much traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is releasing Kraken APUs next year as the next level of performance on 4 nanometer (nm) chip nodes. In the meantime, AMD is heading against Nvidia on the AI front as well with the more cost-effective MI300X chips. Most importantly for investors, Nvidia stole the AI spotlight, leaving AMD stock somewhat underutilized.\n\nAt the present price of $166.33, AMD stock is still far from its all-time high of $227.30 this past March. One-year consensus price targets place AMD shares at $192.56, indicating a potential for a $265 per share ceiling.\n\nUnity Software (U) A developer works on a 3D racing game in the Unity engine on a laptop.\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile AMD, Intel and Nvidia provide the hardware components for metaverse blocks, Unity Software (NYSE:U) is the dominant software platform to create metaverse content. Its Unity Engine is widely used across mobile, console and desktop computers due to easily accessible development tools and a vast library of online tutorials.\n\nAccording to a 6sense survey, Unity holds 27% market share in the game development category. For comparison, the Unreal Engine from privately-held Epic Games, holds 16% market share.\n\nFollowing the departure of Unity CEO John Riccitiello last October, the company is yet to balance its licensing monetization approach. On May 9, Unity delivered its first-quarter earnings. Despite a net loss of $291 million, the bulk went into restructuring costs ($212 million) and convertible notes ($61 million).\n\nIn that light, Unity’s net loss would have only accounted for $141 million. That is a significant improvement over last year’s $254 million net loss. Moving forward, much is expected of Unity 6 for easier multiplatform deployment and AI tools.\n\nOn the monetization front, developers can take advantage of Unity’s integrated Unity Ads and ironSource Ads platform. Unity gets a cut from any deals. On that progress to profitability, Unity Software holds $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents.\n\nFor metaverse investors, this translates to buying on the weakness, which typically provides the greatest profit potential long-term. Given these factors, Unity Software emerges as a compelling choice among metaverse stocks to buy. Year-to-date, U stock is down 45%. At the present price of $21.27, U shares are far removed from their all-time high of $201.12 in November 2021. Nasdaq’s average U price target is $29.05 per share.\n\nVuzix (VUZI) Vuzix (VUZI) branded AR glasses\n\nSource: zixia / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere have been many attempts at unassuming AR glasses, but Vuzix (NASDAQ:VUZI) appears to have hit the sweet spot with Vuzix Z100. Revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2024, these smart glasses can embed prescription lenses and run for two days on a single charge. As investors explore metaverse stocks to buy, Vuzix offers intriguing potential due to its innovative products and ongoing projects.\n\nThe glasses are designed as workflow augmentation rather than immersion. Vuzix built upon three decades of extended reality (XR) experience to develop them. Still a penny stock, Vuzix delivered a net loss of $10.048 million in Q1 2024, in line with the year-ago quarter at $10.241 million.\n\nGiven the reduced sales of M400 glasses, the company saw a 52% decline in revenue. Yet, Vuzix remains positive for the near future with “several new projects with new and existing defense and consumer product-focused customers” during 2024.\n\nSimilar to China’s adoption of smart glasses in law enforcement, the same trend is likely to unfold in the U.S. VUZI stock is down 25% year-to-date. At $1.60 per share, VUZI shares are now 19x lower from the all-time high of $30.57 in April 2021. Yet, the average VUZI price target is nearly double at $3 per share.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) The Best Tech Dividend Stock of 2024?",
        "content": "We recently analyzed the best dividend stocks of 2024.\n\nThough Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) ranks eighth on our list of the 10 Best Dividend Stocks of 2024, we have analyzed the stock in detail.\n\nWe are nearly halfway through the year, and the stock market is showing consistent signs of improvement. Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose only 3.7% so far this year, its broader partner has surged by 11.1% this year so far, with its 12-month return coming in at nearly 26%, as of the close of May 23. However, dividend stocks are still not keeping up with the broader market, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index returning just 3.85% since the start of 2024. Last year also didn’t go well for these equities as tech stocks rose to fame. That said, the tech stocks that drove the market rally, have decided to enhance their shareholder return by initiating dividend policies this year. This could have an impact on the performance of dividend stocks and the overall market. David Harrell, an editor of the Morningstar Dividend Investor newsletter, made the following comment in this regard:\n\n\"The inclusion of the big names [Meta, Alphabet] in any sort of dividend indexes or dividend growth indexes is very likely to increase their correlation with the broad market.\"\n\nWhile dividend stocks lagged behind the market last year, their long-term performance suggests otherwise. Dividend equities represented an average of 34% of the market’s overall return from 1940 to 2023. Not only this, these stocks showed resilience and demonstrated strong performance in comparison to other asset classes during periods of high inflation. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Hartford Funds and mentioned that during eight inflationary periods between 1970 and 2022, dividend stocks outperformed their non-dividend counterparts. Specifically, during the 1970s, a decade marked by high inflation, dividends accounted for nearly 73% of the S&P 500’s total return.\n\nIn addition to this, the dividend growth rate has also surpassed inflation over the years. According to data from Yale University’s Robert Shiller, dividends per share have grown 1.6 percentage points faster annually than inflation since 1871. This growth advantage has increased in recent decades as over the past 50 years, dividends have surpassed inflation by 2.5 percentage points annually, and in the last two decades, by 4.6 annualized percentage points. This ability of dividends to outpace inflation makes them a more attractive investment for long-term investors. Therefore, analysts suggest that investors should not be concerned about dividend stocks underperforming the broader market in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother factor attracting investors to dividend stocks is the increasing amount of dividends US companies have paid over the years. According to recent data, the S&P 500 companies paid $151.6 billion in dividends in the first quarter of 2024, up from $146.8 billion during the same period last year. The report also mentioned that 796 companies announced dividend hikes during the quarter, amounting to $22.7 billion, growing from $19.7 billion in the prior-year period. This indicates that dividend payments are on the right track this year. Analysts have also given a positive outlook for dividend stocks in 2024.\n\nVeteran dividend investor Warren Buffett's portfolio can be a good start for our readers to understand dividend investing. Read Warren Buffett’s 8 Best Dividend Stock Picks. Is Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) The Best Tech Stock of 2024?\n\nPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a California-based semiconductor manufacturing company that specializes in a wide range of infrastructure software solutions. The company invests heavily in research and development to drive innovation in its software solutions.\n\nFor dividend-paying companies, strong cash flow is particularly important as it ensures that there is ample money to fund its dividends. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s cash position remained strong in the first quarter of 2024. The company reported an operating cash flow of over $4.8 billion and its free cash flow (FCF) came in at $4.7 billion. The FCF represented 39% of its revenue. During the quarter, the company returned approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. In the first quarter, the company generated revenue of roughly $12 billion, which showed a 34% growth from the same period last year.\n\nWhile many tech companies distribute dividends, only a handful have a long-standing record of providing strong returns to shareholders. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands out with a solid track record of dividend payments. The company started paying dividends in 2011 and has raised its payouts every year since then. Over these years, its annual dividend has grown from $0.36 per share to $21.00 per share. In comparison, other tech companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) pay relatively small amounts in dividends, with yields significantly lower than AVGO. In the past five years, the company has raised its dividends at an annual average rate of 17.49%. It currently offers a quarterly dividend of $5.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.51%, as recorded on May 20.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares are up by 30.2% this year so far, as of the close of May 20, outperforming the S&P 500, which returned 11.9% year-to-date. The stock has also surpassed the broader market’s performance over a 5-year period, returning 448.7%, compared to the market’s 87.8% return during this period.\n\nBroadcom Inc. has been a huge beneficiary of the booming AI infrastructure spending incurred by mega-cap companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon. AVGO’s trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 52.2 raised concerns about its potential overvaluation. However, with sustained growth and profitability, the current valuation may be justified. In its recent earnings report, the President and CEO of the company announced that they expect to generate consolidated revenue of $50 billion in FY24, mainly driven by advancements in AI. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Broadcom but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nBroadcom Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Mastercard Inc. MA, Amgen Inc. AMGN, Utah Medical Products, Inc. UTMD and Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc. BAER,\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, Mastercard and Amgen\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Amgen Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks Utah Medical Products, Inc. and Bridger Aerospace Group Holdings, Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have lagged the Zacks Tech sector (+10.2% vs. 42.7%) as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year (+10.2% vs. +29.1%) reflecting a combination of the company's China exposure and perception of insufficiently well placed for AI. The company's second-quarter fiscal 2024 results suffered from weak iPhone demand. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.\r\n\r\nApple's results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on plans to expand the usage of AI in the company's devices and record $110 billion share repurchase announcement reflects strong prospects.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple has been suffering from stiff competition in the smartphone market and weakness in China. Growing legal complexities, including ongoing EPIC and Masimo lawsuits and the latest case by the U.S. Department of Justice, have been a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Mastercard have modestly outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +21.2%). Numerous acquisitions are helping the company to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for the firm's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.\r\n\r\nIt is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nHowever, steep operating expenses might stress its margins. Also, we expect general and administrative costs to jump almost 11% in 2024. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9.0% vs. -3.8%). The company beat first-quarter estimates for earnings and sales. It expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Horizon's rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.\r\n\r\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Utah Medical Products have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+26.9% vs. +4.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $237.5 million have witnessed the loss of a major OEM customer which has significantly impacted revenues, leading to a 9.4% sales decline in Q1 2024. Intense competition from industry giants pressures profitability.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Utah Medical Products is well-positioned in the growing medical device market, driven by rising chronic diseases, aging populations and demand for home healthcare. Its diverse product portfolio in obstetrics, gynecology, electrosurgery and neonatal care targets high-growth segments, ensuring sustained demand.\r\n\r\nThe company's Q1 2024 revenue distribution shows robust diversification, enhancing stability with 45.4% from international sales. UTMD's strong cost management improved the net income margin to 34.9% in Q1 2024 despite increased litigation costs. The company's solid balance sheet, with $93.8 million in cash, supports strategic growth and shareholder returns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Utah Medical Products here >>>)\r\n\r\nBridger Aerospace's shares have underperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (-39% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $191.82 million taps into the aerial firefighting market, which is expected to witness a modest growth. Risks include high revenue concentration, seasonal variability, steep operational costs, reliance on government contracts, and expansion challenges.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Bridger's success hinges on managing these risks while leveraging market growth opportunities. The company saw a revenue jump to $67 million in 2023, up 44.4%, buoyed by significant contracts despite a slow fire season. The firm's global reach expanded, entering markets like Canada and Spain, thereby diversifying its revenue sources.\r\n\r\nFleet and tech advancements, including acquiring Super Scoopers and a fire surveillance Software as a service (SaaS) platform, enhanced operational capacity.

        "content": "Investing in the best tech stocks to buy for 10X returns by 2035 presents a compelling opportunity to achieve outsized returns. The technology sector will undergo massive transformation driven by industries including artificial intelligence, accelerated computing, renewable energy and biotechnology.\n\nThese innovations promise to not only revolutionize industries but also create substantial growth prospects for forward-thinking investors. While established giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have delivered impressive returns, their sheer size may limit their potential for exponential growth. By identifying and investing in the right tech stocks now, investors can position themselves to capitalize on the exponential growth potential these innovative companies provide.\n\nNow, let’s unpack the top tech stocks to buy for 10X returns by 2035!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is increasingly becoming one of the most loved tech stocks on Wall Street. The company is synonymous with artificial intelligence, targeting government corporations and commercial enterprises from small to large.\n\nPalantir’s competitive advantage lies in its ability to handle complex, unstructured data and integrate it with existing systems. This has made the company an invaluable partner to organizations as diverse as government agencies, finance, healthcare and manufacturing. The company recently achieved its first full year of GAAP profitability in the 2023 fiscal year, and growth is expected to continue in 2024. In Q1 FY24, its revenue increased 21% YOY to $634 million. The company’s AIP platform continues to gain traction, with commercial revenue up 27% YOY.  Moreover, operating income hit $80.8 million and FCF swelled to $149 million. With its commercial platform continuing to gain traction, Palantir could be on the brink of a decade long bull run.\n\nGoDaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), the world’s largest domain registrar, is a household name and one of the best stocks to buy for 10X returns by 2035.

Its unified software platform is driving diversified growth, translating to higher conversion and retention.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayoneer (PAYO) Payoneer editorial.

The increasing demand for digital payments, particularly for freelancers, has contributed immensely to its growth over the last several years. The company’s network spans over 200 countries and territories, making it a true global player. Moreover, it will achieve its second year of GAAP profitability as a public company in the 2024 fiscal year.

        "content": "U.S. technology equities continue to be on a tear in the second quarter. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen by roughly 13% year-to-date. If macroeconomic indicators exhibit signs of recovery from persistent inflation, U.S. equities could extend their rally. In this situation, software stocks are even better poised for significant gains. The artificial intelligence craze has influenced tech stocks since early last year and will probably do so for the time being. Software firms have scrambled to employ AI technologies in their products and have assured investors of the long-term benefits of artificial intelligence for their respective platforms.\n\nThe software stocks below are involved in various sub-verticals of the space, and their exposure to AI will help their shares surge 5X over the next five years.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) makes the initial entry on this software stocks to buy list. The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a new era for remote working and a surge in demand for cloud computing services. With a plethora of data flowing through data centers, cloud services have required a host of new cybersecurity tools. That’s where CrowdStrike comes in. The cybersecurity firm offers a comprehensive suite of solutions for endpoint security and vulnerability management (VM). These technologies help to secure “endpoints,” such as laptops, phones, and desktops, while also deploying threat-detection capabilities to ameliorate a breach before it becomes severe.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite concerns about the macroeconomic environment, CrowdStrike has continued to increase sales with robust, double-digit growth figures. Similarly, in their Q4 FY2024 earnings report, CrowdStrike reported annual recurring revenue (ARR) Y/Y growth of 34% to $3.44 billion. The firm’s Falcon platform, which leverages AI to identify and neutralize threats as well as offers an AI security analyst chatbot named Charlotte AI, will likely gain more traction as demand for AI cybersecurity services increases.\n\nCRWD shares have rallied nearly 40% since the start of the year.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a data analytics firm that has gained traction with a number of defense industry-related companies over the years. Last year, Palantir reported its first profitable year, generating $209.8 million in net income. Better operational efficiencies coupled with higher demand for AI products helped the platform to finally reach bottom-line profitability. I’ve noted in prior articles about Palantir that its AI Platform was most likely a lot of hype. Based on Palantir’s trimmed guidance after their Q1 2024 report, that idea seems less far-fetched.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there may be a lot of AI hype driving Palantir’s shares, it doesn’t mean the data analytics firm’s platform will not gain traction in the future. Palantir continues to successfully market the AI Platform to prospective users, and with an increasingly diverse base of customers, the platform will gain traction. This makes Palantir a good long-term bet for investors seeking compelling returns in the next five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for tech heavy-weight Google. From providing a globally successful search engine and mobile operating system to providing cloud computing and AI services, Google is really setting itself up for continued success. The tech giant’s trading valuation multiple is only icing on the cake. GOOG trades at about 22.9x forward earnings, while the plurality of its competitors- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – are trading at relative premiums.\n\nIn the company’s Q1 2024 earnings report, Google Cloud solidified itself as the company’s profit growth engine, despite investors having held doubts about the platform’s long-term viability. Operating income for the cloud business segment came in at $900 million in Q1, increasing 3.7x on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe tech giant’s foray into AI could help boost Google Cloud’s sales growth and profitability in the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "72% of Warren Buffett's $378 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Stocks",
        "content": "For nearly 60 years, Warren Buffett has been dazzling Wall Street with his investing prowess. Whereas the widely followed S&P 500 has delivered a hearty total return (including dividends paid) of around 34,700% since the Oracle of Omaha became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Buffett has generated aggregate returns in excess of 5,000,000% for his company's Class A shareholders.\n\nThough past performance is no guarantee of future results, Warren Buffett has demonstrated an ability to continually outperform the benchmark indexes over extended timelines.\n\nThe catalysts that fueled his phenomenal investment returns are well documented. Many books have been written describing the attributes he looks for when investing, such as sustainable moats, top-notch management teams, and strong capital-return programs.\n\nBut the one factor that deserves far more credit than it's given for Berkshire Hathaway's otherworldly returns over the past six decades is portfolio concentration. Despite stakes in 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds, the vast majority of Berkshire's invested assets have been put to work in just a handful of Buffett's top ideas. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has every reason to smile after running circles around the S&P 500 for nearly six decades. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nFollowing the release of Berkshire Hathaway's latest Form 13F, which updates buying and selling activity from the quarter ended in March, 72% ($272.3 billion) of the $378 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees is invested in just five stocks.\n\nApple: $149,766,876,019 (39.7% of invested assets)\n\nDespite selling nearly 116.2 million shares of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) during the first quarter, the second-largest publicly traded company by market cap still accounts for close to 40% of Berkshire's invested assets.\n\nBuffett justified paring down Berkshire's very much in-the-money stake in Apple by referencing historically low corporate income tax rates. He believes that it's likely peak corporate income tax rates will rise from where they currently sit at 21%. Therefore, locking in gains now will, eventually, be looked at favorably by investors.\n\nYet even with this selling activity, Buffett views Apple as one of Berkshire Hathaway's best businesses. That's because it has an incredibly loyal customer base, a rock-solid management team, and it has allowed its innovation to do most of the talking. The iPhone is the domestic smartphone market-share leader, and CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a successful transition that emphasizes higher-margin subscription services.\n\nBut Buffett's favorite thing about Apple might just be its capital-return program. Besides being on track to pay out more than $15.4 billion in dividends to its shareholders over the next year, Apple has repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. That $674 billion is greater than the market cap of 492 of the 500 companies that make up the S&P 500 -- and one of the remaining eight is Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough this stake could be pared down a bit more, Apple is likely to remain Berkshire's top investment holding by a significant percentage.\n\nBank of America: $40,529,112,715 (10.7% of invested assets)\n\nThe second-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio is money-center behemoth Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), best known as BofA. Its shares have rallied 56% since touching a 52-week low on Oct. 27.\n\nWhat Warren Buffett has often appreciated about financial stocks is their cyclical nature. Instead of trying to time when economic downturns are inevitably going to occur, he has packed his company's portfolio with businesses that can take advantage of lengthy expansions. Since periods of growth last substantially longer than recessions, bank stocks like BofA are able to prudently expand their loan portfolios.\n\nSpeaking of loans, Bank of America is the most interest-sensitive among America's biggest banks by assets. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, BofA has brought in billions of dollars in added net-interest income each quarter. The longer the nation's central bank holds pat on adjusting interest rates, the more money Bank of America is liable to make.\n\nIt made significant headway with its technology investments as well. On the consumer side of its business, digital banking adoption for households rose to 76% by the end of March, which is up 6 percentage points from the comparable period three years ago. Online and mobile-based transactions are considerably less costly for banks, which should lead to improved operating efficiency for BofA. Image source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: $36,794,400,783 (9.7% of invested assets)\n\nHave I pointed out yet that Warren Buffett is a huge fan of financial stocks? If I haven't, note that credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) is Berkshire's third-largest holding by market value and accounts for close to 10% of invested assets.\n\nSimilar to BofA, American Express is a logical beneficiary of disproportionately long periods of growth. Whereas nine of 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II were resolved in less than a year, most economic expansions have lasted for years. Lengthy periods of growth encourage consumers and businesses to spend, which is precisely what AmEx wants.\n\nAmerican Express' recipe for sustained growth has everything to do with its ability to benefit from both sides of a transaction. It's the clear No. 3 payment processor in credit-card network purchase volume in the U.S., which allows it to generate fees from merchants. But it's also a lender, which enables AmEx to potentially collect interest income from its cardholders.\n\nFurthermore, American Express has historically attracted cardholders with higher incomes. Well-to-do cardholders are less likely to alter their spending habits during minor economic disruptions. In theory, this better positions AmEx to deal with downturns in the U.S. and global economies, when compared to other lending institutions.\n\nCoca-Cola: $25,244,000,000 (6.7% of invested assets)\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Buffett's longest-held stock, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), is also one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. Coca-Cola has been a continuous holding since 1988 and is viewed as one of the eight companies Buffett and his team plan to hold \"indefinitely.\"\n\nThe beauty of Coca-Cola is that it's a consumer staples stock. It provides a basic necessity (beverages) that consumers are going to buy no matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing.\n\nBrand-name consumer staples stocks tend to deliver predictable operating cash flow year after year. This is a big reason Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years, which in turn has increased Berkshire's annual yield relative to its own cost basis in Coke to about 60%!\n\nDespite its size, Coca-Cola offers a nice blend of growth and predictability. It's able to generate transparent cash flow from its more than two dozen billion-dollar brands in developed markets, and can lean on faster-growing emerging markets to organically increase its sales. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, it has ongoing operations in every country.\n\nWhat's more, Coca-Cola's marketing team is truly top-notch. The company has been leaning on digital media and artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor advertisements to younger audiences. Meanwhile, the company's rich history and well-known brand ambassadors allow it to stay engaged with its more mature customers.\n\nChevron: $19,983,053,835 (5.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe fifth stock -- along with Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola -- that collectively accounts for 72% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is Chevron(NYSE: CVX).\n\nBuffett and his leading investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have piled into two energy stocks since this decade began, with Chevron accounting for the larger weighting of the two. Having more than 9% of Berkshire's portfolio devoted to energy stocks is an indication that its smartest investment minds expect the spot price of oil to remain elevated, or perhaps head even higher.\n\nThe top catalyst for crude oil is the lack of capital investment that occurred globally for three years during the height of the pandemic. With Chevron and other global energy majors forced to sit on their hands due to demand uncertainty, increasing the supply of crude oil following the worst of the pandemic has become a challenge. When the supply of an in-demand commodity is constrained, it's pretty typical for the price to rise.\n\nThough Chevron generates its best margins from drilling, and will undoubtedly benefit if the spot price of crude stays above its historic norm, it's important to recognize that it's also an integrated energy company.\n\nThis is to say that it owns transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries, in addition to its upstream drilling assets. These midstream and downstream assets help to hedge against downside in the spot price of crude oil, as well as produce predictable operating cash flow in almost any economy.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Chevron's board approved a $75 billion share repurchase program in 2023 and has raised its base annual payout for 37 consecutive years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement",
        "content": "Alongside its latest earnings results, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a 10:1 stock split and a 150% dividend raise following the market closed on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia shares, now the ninth most expensive in the S&P 500, opened above $1,000 a day after the print. A 10:1 split would imply a $100/share price, all else being equal, after trading opens on Monday, June 10th.\n\nThis year, eight companies announced stock splits, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) in January and Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) in March. The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the ‘Magnificent 7’ mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) split in 2020, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are nearing the $500/share threshold.\n\n“S&P 500 stocks with share prices over $500 represent $7.4tn in market cap, or about 16% of the index,” Bank of America analysts said in a Thursday note.\n\nIn their recently updated research, BofA found that stock splits are typically bullish for companies that enact them. On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n“Splits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,” analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA’s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n“Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,” the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon readies Alexa for its second act—but it has an uphill battle",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI.\n\nBefore ChatGPT could talk, there was Alexa. The decade-old Amazon voice assistant, however, never fully delivered on its potential and was useful for little more than setting a kitchen timer or telling you the weather.\n\nBut now with the full force of generative AI at its disposal, Amazon is looking toward Alexa’s second act. Sometime this year, the company plans to launch an overhauled, “more conversational” version of Alexa, sources told CNBC. Along with new and improved generative AI-powered capabilities, Amazon also plans to introduce a new business model for Alexa. Rather than be included with the company’s Prime subscription, Alexa will require its own monthly subscription.\n\nWhile Alexa has previously dominated voice assistant competitors, including Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, the recent steady release of powerful generative AI-powered chatbots has made clear this space is newly up for grabs. Amazon has already sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, according to Amazon, which could give the company a leg up.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon hasn’t exactly shown itself to be an AI disrupter—the company is certainly supporting the AI boom via Amazon Web Services and has hitched its wagon to AI startup Anthropic by investing billions of dollars in it, but it hasn’t released any leading AI models that would put it in the same realm as OpenAI, Google, or Meta.\n\nA generative AI-powered Alexa could be Amazon’s opportunity to finally get in on the AI boom, not to mention finally deliver on the true vision of Alexa. But it faces real challenges: its own lagging position in AI, technical hurdles and runaway compute costs still plaguing the industry, and fierce competition from other tech giants that are all vying to deliver the best AI assistant experience.\n\nDespite the recent controversy around the Scarlett Johansson-esque voice for ChatGPT, OpenAI put a stake in the ground with its demo of the latest version of its product last week. Google has also rolled out voice support for its Gemini model. And next month at its annual developers conference, Apple is expected to unveil a new generative AI-powered, more conversational Siri. Apple faces many of the same challenges as Amazon in terms of its AI position, but the company is reportedly negotiating with Google to bring its leading Gemini model to the iPhone.\n\n“A lot of us have had this vision for what a powerful assistant can be, but we were held back by the underlying technology not being able to serve that goal,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the Decoder podcast this week. “I think we have a technology that is better able to serve that. That’s why you’re seeing the progress again. I think that’s exciting.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf these products succeed, they could completely change how we interact with technology, get information, organize our lives, and use products and services. The New York Times reported that Apple executives worry new AI technology could displace its iPhone’s iOS software and threaten its dominance over the smartphone market. With an ecosystem of AI agents, we may no longer need apps or the app store.\n\nThat’s the exact future wearable maker Humane was betting on with its Ai Pin, though it’s clear we’re still quite a ways off. The Ai Pin was designed to speak out loud to people wearing it and handle many of the same tasks as Alexa and Siri, but it failed to deliver. Gadget reviewer Marques Brownlee dubbed it “the worst product I’ve ever reviewed…for now”, and yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Humane is seeking to be acquired after the product’s rocky launch.\n\nThe dream of finally delivering a true AI assistant feels closer than ever before, and at the same time, still very far away. In OpenAI’s demo last week, Sky very much sounded like a real person—both in terms of its voice and how it answered questions (and as always, it’s important to remember that we can only trust a demo so much). But sounding like a real person is only half the battle. These models are still limited by the fact that they’re confidently wrong all the time. As I continue to test ChatGPT, I am floored by how consistently wrong it is. I feel like I can’t trust a word it says.\n\n“I wonder if the intelligence is increasing at the same rate as the facility with language,” Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, said to Pichai during the Decoder conversation. “I kind of don’t see it, to be perfectly honest. I see computers getting much better at language and actually in some cases getting dumber.”\n\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news.\n\nSage Lazzaro\r\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.\r\n\r\nApple’s results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s positive comments on plans to expand the usage of AI in the company’s devices and record $110 billion share repurchase announcement reflects strong prospects.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple has been suffering from stiff competition in the smartphone market and weakness in China. Growing legal complexities, including ongoing EPIC and Masimo lawsuits and the latest case by the U.S. Department of Justice, have been a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Mastercard have modestly outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+24.6% vs. +21.2%). Numerous acquisitions are helping the company to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for the firm's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.\r\n\r\nIt is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nHowever, steep operating expenses might stress its margins. Also, we expect general and administrative costs to jump almost 11% in 2024. High rebates and incentives may weigh on net revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Mastercard here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+9.0% vs. -3.8%). The company beat first-quarter estimates for earnings and sales. It expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Horizon’s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.\r\n\r\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Utah Medical Products have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+26.9% vs. +4.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $237.5 million have witnessed the loss of a major OEM customer which has significantly impacted revenues, leading to a 9.4% sales decline in Q1 2024. Intense competition from industry giants pressures profitability.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Utah Medical Products is well-positioned in the growing medical device market, driven by rising chronic diseases, aging populations and demand for home healthcare. Its diverse product portfolio in obstetrics, gynecology, electrosurgery and neonatal care targets high-growth segments, ensuring sustained demand.\r\n\r\nThe company’s Q1 2024 revenue distribution shows robust diversification, enhancing stability with 45.4% from international sales. UTMD's strong cost management improved the net income margin to 34.9% in Q1 2024 despite increased litigation costs. The company’s solid balance sheet, with $93.8 million in cash, supports strategic growth and shareholder returns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Utah Medical Products here >>>)\r\n\r\nBridger Aerospace’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (-39% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $191.82 million taps into the aerial firefighting market, which is expected to witness a modest growth. Risks include high revenue concentration, seasonal variability, steep operational costs, reliance on government contracts, and expansion challenges.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Bridger’s success hinges on managing these risks while leveraging market growth opportunities. The company saw a revenue jump to $67 million in 2023, up 44.4%, buoyed by significant contracts despite a slow fire season. The firm's global reach expanded, entering markets like Canada and Spain, thereby diversifying its revenue sources.\r\n\r\nFleet and tech advancements, including acquiring Super Scoopers and a fire surveillance Software as a service (SaaS) platform, enhanced operational capacity. Financially, despite a 2023 loss, adjusted EBITDA skyrocketed 405.4%, with an expectation of future growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Bridger Aerospace here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today Cambium Networks Corporation (CMBM), Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024",
        "content": "It is the unofficial kickoff to summer this weekend. Millions of Americans are expected to hit the road and fly the skies to enjoy warmer weather and get a break from the grind. We've seen just how popular many forms of in-person entertainment have been in the past year, so there's reason for optimism on the consumption front.\n\nRecall that about a year ago, the \"Taylor Swift Effect\" drove improved economic growth in certain regions (no joke, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said as much), and strong ratings and ticket sales have been seen for other artists and in live sports.[1] It doesn't hurt that, as of this writing, a pair of New York professional sports teams are making playoff runs too.\n\nBut not all entertainment venues have been welcoming boisterous crowds. So far in 2024, domestic gross box office sales are down 24% from year-ago levels through May 15, according to IMDbPro.[2] It comes as Hollywood struggles to put out popular blockbusters and as continued drama in the media-enterprise space casts a dark cloud over out-of-the-house entertainment.\n\nWeaker box office sales in 2024 Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro\n\nBundle-unbundle-rebundle\n\nInvestors and casual observers alike have surely read and heard about the ongoing drama at Disney (NYSE:DIS). All the while, families across the country have been forced to consider the steeply rising costs of subscription streaming services. Maybe just as frustrating for consumers, it seems the movies and entertainment industry is now pivoting from an a la carte sales model back to bundling, which has features of the old-school cable package.\n\nCorporate activity\n\nThere has been no break in the action this year with so many moving pieces and a reshuffling of the media playing field. It was just a handful of months ago when Lionsgate Studio spun off from Starz. The new entity, Lionsgate Studios Corp. (LFG.A), focuses on film and TV. Then in May, shares of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) fell on a report that Sony was rethinking its $26 billion bid for the company.[3] The latest whisper is that Paramount and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may partner up.[4]\n\nNetflix pounces on new opportunities\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, continues to venture further into sports, inking a three-year deal with the NFL to stream a set of games each season.[5] It also plans to launch an in-house advertising technology platform to further diversify its revenue sources.[6] The Communication Services stalwart may not be grouped with the Magnificent Seven heavyweights, but shares are up more than 25% in 2024.[7] Boasting a highly profitable ad-supported tier, with a total subscriber base of 40 million customers, up five million from a year ago, consumers just keep chillin'.[8]\n\nStory continues\n\n2021 social media favorites come roaring back\n\nAnd how can we not offer a nod to meme-stock mania Part III? Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC) have gone bananas in recent weeks, all prompted by a single picture posted to X by @TheRoaringKitty earlier this month.[9] Of course, the social-trading frenzy has little to do with fundamentals in the movie market, but the saga is worthy of sitting back with a bowl of popcorn and seeing what unfolds.\n\nFeature films\n\nBut let's aim the spotlight at the movie scene as the summer months inch closer. Our data show that, as has become the norm, Netflix dominates the movie-release count from mid-May through the Labor Day weekend. Nineteen major motion pictures are slated to be released. Sony Pictures Studios is runner-up with 13 movies set to hit the domestic box office. Disney and Lionsgate also have several high-profile films in the cue.\n\nMajor movie release count through Labor Day weekend Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nConferences and shareholder meetings on tap\n\nOn the event watch, following the JP Morgan 52nd Annual TMT Global Technology Media and Communications Conference this week, be on the lookout for potential volatility in the media space on May 30 when the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference (SDC) begins. Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), Paramount Global, AMC and Netflix each hold annual shareholder meetings during the first full week of June. All eyes will then be on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when it holds its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\n\nGrab your popcorn What to watch this summer\n\nAs for the box office, much depends on how the summer lineup performs. Here are the key motion pictures that analysts will watch closely and movie-goers can look forward to:\n\nMay 24: The Garfield Movie, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, AtlasJune 7: The CrowJune 14: Inside Out 2, Bad Boys 4June 21: The BikeridersJune 28: A Quiet Place: Day One, Horizon: An American Saga (Chapter 1)July 3: Despicable Me 4July 5: MaXXXineJuly 12: LonglegsJuly 19: TwistersJuly 26: Deadpool & WolverineAugust 9: BorderlandsAugust 16: Horizon: An American Saga (Chapter 2), Alien: RomulusAugust 30: Kraven the HunterSeptember 6: Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThere's been more drama and action scenes in movie stocks than on the big screen so far in 2024. The media space continues to go through shakeups both in the boardroom and with broad strategies. All the while, consumers may be growing increasingly frustrated with TV options, but data suggests fewer folks are flocking to theaters for entertainment. All eyes will now be on Hollywood's summer lineup.\n\n1 Summary of Economic Activity, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, June 2023, https://www.philadelphiafed.org2 Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro, May 22, 2024, https://www.boxofficemojo.com/3 Paramount shares fall after CNBC reports Sony rethinking its bid, Reuters, May 14, 2024, https://www.reuters.com4 Paramount Holds Talks With Amazon About Expanded Partnership, Bloomberg, Thomas Buckley, Lucas Shaw, May 15, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com5 Netflix Nears Deal for NFL Games, Extending Push Into Sports, Bloomberg, Lucas Shaw, Randall Williams, May 15, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com6 Netflix To Launch In-House Advertising Tech Platform, Next TV, Jon Lafayette, May 15, 2024, https://www.nexttv.com7 NFLX, Stockcharts, May 17, 2024, http://stockcharts.com8 Netflix hits 40 million users for ad-supported plan, Reuters, May 16, 2024, https://www.reuters.com9 TheRoaringKitty, X, May 12, 2024, https://x.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "DOJ widens antitrust crackdown as it seeks a breakup of Live Nation",
        "content": "The Justice Department is widening its antitrust crackdown as it goes after Live Nation (LYV), filing a lawsuit Thursday that seeks a breakup of the entertainment giant.\n\nUS prosecutors and a group of states argue that Live Nation used its Ticketmaster ticketing monopoly to suppress competition. The lawsuit follows a two-year investigation into the company.\n\nThe suit comes 14 years after DOJ approved a merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster is a dominant provider of ticket sales across the US that processes more than 80% of sales, while Live Nation owns and operates hundreds of high-profile venues and is a giant concert promoter.\n\nThe combined company has long faced criticism of what lawmakers and regulators consider to be exorbitant fees, problematic customer service and unfair practices.\n\nLive Nation’s stock was down roughly 5% as the suit was filed in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\"Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement, cited by multiple media outlets.\n\n\"The result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services,\" Garland added. \"It is time to break up Live Nation.\"\n\nLive Nation immediately refuted the lawsuit, calling the allegations \"baseless.\"\n\n\"The DOJ’s complaint attempts to portray Live Nation and Ticketmaster as the cause of fan frustration with the live entertainment industry,\" said Dan Wall, Live Nation executive vice president for corporate and regulatory affairs.\n\n\"It blames concert promoters and ticketing companies—neither of which control ticket prices—for high ticket prices. It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from increasing production costs to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary tickets cost.\"\n\nThe new legal action is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries. Joe Berchtold, president and CFO of Live Nation Entertainment, testified before a Senate committee in January 2023, in the wake of problems surrounding access to ticket purchases for Taylor Swift performances. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win McNamee via Getty Images)\n\nSince the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was approved in 2010, the company has been at the center of antitrust concerns, with critics taking aim at sky-high ticket fees and accusing the entertainment giant of anti-competitive behavior.\n\nIn 2020, the Justice Department updated the company's consent decree, an agreement which barred Live Nation from strong-arming venues into using Ticketmaster for its tours, and extended it until 2025.\n\nIt did so after it said it found evidence the company repeatedly and over the course of several years engaged in conduct that violated its earlier agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Capitol Hill ramped up its fight against Live Nation during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at the start of last year following a 2022 fiasco with Taylor Swift concert tickets.\n\nTicketmaster's online software struggled to handle the demand for presale orders and fans complained they were denied tickets as they tried to buy. The scene outside the U.S. Capitol in January 2023 as the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to explore whether the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster stifled competition and harmed the consumer marketplace. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nAt the time, multiple senators called for a breakup of the company, although some Wall Street analysts have argued a breakup wouldn't necessarily solve the problems surrounding the unregulated secondary ticket market.\n\nAnalysts have also said Live Nation would be a \"shell of itself\" without Ticketmaster as that entity makes up the bulk of the profits.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, the company saw its fiscal year 2023 revenue surge 36% year over year to $22.7 billion, while its earnings per share more than doubled to $1.37. Concert attendance climbed 20% as over 145 million fans attended over 50,000 events.\n\nAnalyst Matthew Harrigan sees a DOJ lawsuit against Live Nation as being \"significantly politicized\" amid the US election year, and says the department \"has been generally unsuccessful in applying horizontal M&A theories.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that any targeted unwinding of the 2010 Live Nation Ticketmaster merger likely has only a remote likelihood under accepted antitrust law although we would be wary of the likely initial New York State Federal Court venue,\" he said.\n\nDeutsche Bank, meanwhile, said \"the pursuit of a breakup of Live Nation by the DOJ is somewhat surprising, and raises the stakes of the investigation.\"\n\n\"We would anticipate that Live Nation plans to defend its position in court, and could still win, but this issue is likely to remain an overhang for some time,\" the bank added, noting a possible drag on the stock price.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Why Ticketmaster Owner Live Nation's Shares Are Tumbling Today\n\nLive Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV) shares are trading lower on Thursday as the company faces a legal challenge after the U.S. Department of Justice and several states prepare to file an antitrust lawsuit against the entertainment giant over its control of concert ticket sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the case, which is expected to be filed in the Southern District of New York on Thursday, could lead to the company’s breakup.\n\nThe lawsuit targets Live Nation’s dominance in the ticketing market through its subsidiary Ticketmaster.\n\nThis lawsuit is part of the Biden administration’s broader strategy to tackle monopolistic practices in various industries.\n\nThe Justice Department has already initiated legal actions against tech giants like Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) for monopolistic practices in the online marketplace.\n\nFollowing the news of the impending lawsuit, Live Nation’s shares fell, highlighting investor concerns over the potential outcomes of the legal action.\n\nLive Nation, the largest concert promoter in the United States, merged with Ticketmaster in 2010.

        "title": "Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a popular tech company that makes iPhones and Mac computers. Its growth rate is slowing as the company transitions from its past focus on mobile phones and computer products to online services, including cloud and artificial intelligence products.\n\nDespite slowing growth, Apple generates massive amounts of free cash flow, most of which is being used to buy back shares. This discussion will focus on why the stock looks cheap, given its use of FCF to make huge share repurchases.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with ITUB.\n\nI estimate the stock could be worth at least 17% more at over $222 per share based on its powerful free cash flow. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nFirst, let's look at its free cash flow generation, as Apple is a veritable cash cow.\n\nApple looks cheap based on its free cash flow\n\nIn the first quarter, Apple's revenue fell 4.30% and its net income dropped 2.20%. But earnings per share rose 0.30% from $1.52 to $1.53. The reason is because the company reduced its share count by 2.42% on average, which was slightly more than the drop in net income.\n\nThat is one way Apple's huge buybacks have been helping the stock, despite its negative growth. In fact, on May 2, it announced a new $110 billion share purchase program. It can easily afford this, too. For example, in the trailing 12 months ending March 31, Apple generated $103.90 billion in free cash flow. Further, as will be shown below, the company is forecasted to generate around $111 billion in FCF by the end of the next fiscal year.\n\nFCF is the amount of cash flow left over after covering all cash expenses and net changes in working capital, as shown in the statement of cash flows (i.e., operating cash flow), less spending on capital expenditures.\n\nApple spent $81.80 billion on buybacks in the trailing 12-month period to March 31, or 78.70% of its FCF during that period. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThis shows Apple can afford to do these massive buybacks. Next year, I project the tech giant could buy back $94 billion in shares if it raises its buybacks to 85% of FCF, up from 79% in the last 12 months.\n\nFor example, in the fourth quarter, Apple spent 112% of its FCF on share repurchases. That means it borrowed money or drew down its huge $67 billion cash and marketable securities balance to cover the excess FCF buyback spending.\n\nHere is how I came up with this FCF estimate. I took Apple's operating cash flow margin over the trailing 12-month period ending March and applied that margin to analysts' revenue estimates. Then I deducted capital expenditure spending, using its historical capex/revenue ratios.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis can be seen in the table below: Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThe table shows that over the trailing 12 months ending March 31, the company had a 29.2% operating cash flow margin.\n\nUsing analysts' revenue estimates for this year ending September 2024 and 2025 and deducing 2.30% of sales for capital expenditure spending, free cash flow could rise 2.70% to $104 billion this fiscal year and $110.80 billion next year ending September 2025.\n\nThe bottom line is that even with sales growing just 1% this year and 6.20% next year, Apple could still generate between $104 billion and $111 billion in free cash flow. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThat will be more than enough to cover the new $110 billion buyback program, even if it takes more than one year to complete.\n\nBut what is driving this huge share repurchase program? Let's look at the potential effects.\n\nShare buyback forecast\n\nThe chart below shows Apple has reduced its share count between 2.40% and 3.20% on a rolling annualized basis each quarter for the past two and a half years. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThe average year-over-year decline has been 2.53% in the trailing 12 months to March 31. The average decline in share count has been 2.75% annually for the past 24 months.\n\nSo going forward, we can expect its share count could fall at least 2.53% and possibly as much as 2.73% given the larger $110 billion buyback program.\n\nHere is how that would work out if compounded over five, 10 and 15 years. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThis shows Apple's share count could fall between 28% and 31% over the next 10 years if the company averages between a 2.53% and 2.75% annual drop in shares due to buybacks.\n\nIn other words, given this would only happen if the company can generate higher amounts of free cash flow, the stock is likely to rise as a result.\n\nPrice target\n\nBased on a 3% FCF yield metric, it is likely that Apple's market value could be worth almost $3.60 trillion based on our FCF estimates. That is 23% higher than its present $2.91 trillion market cap. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThis implies the stock could be worth 23% more or $233.79 per share.\n\nThis method assumes the market values its FCF at a yield of 3%. For example, in the last 12 months, the company has spent $81.80 billion on share repurchases and $15.10 billion on dividends, or $97 billion in total shareholder returns. That represents 3.30% of its present $2.90 trillion market capitalization.\n\nSo, just to be conservative, let's lower the valuation metric to a 3.33% FCF yield. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nThat lowers the price target to just 10.8% higher at $210.43 per share. However, the average of these two methods results in a market cap of $3.40 trillion. That means the average stock price target is 17% higher at $222.11 per share. Why Apple's $110 Billion Buyback Program Works\n\nKeep in mind this does not include the effects of the higher $110 billion share buyback program. That would likely boost the target price at least another 2.50% to 5% to potentially a 22% higher stock price. The bottom line is Apple looks undervalued here.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows in May",
        "content": "It’s been an incredible year for growth stocks. As measured by the Nasdaq 100 Index, growth stocks have rallied 35% over the past 12 months. And starting from the Fall 2022 lows, the Nasdaq 100 has now rallied more than 70% in total. But investors haven’t completely missed out on easy money with these growth stocks at 52-week lows.\n\nCertainly, valuations have gotten rather stretched in a lot of leading areas like AI and semiconductor manufacturers. However, even amid this seemingly non-stop tech stock bull market, there are still some bargains to be found.\n\nIn fact, all three of these growth stocks to buy now are currently at or just above their 52-week lows. While these companies are currently reporting downbeat earnings and are in something of a cyclical trough, these three growth stocks have what it takes to get back on track and see their shares post major recoveries in the back half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCisco (CSCO) Where and Why You Can Steal Cisco Stock\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a leading communications technology company.\n\nMost investors probably know Cisco for its internet networking gear, such as routers and network switching systems. And to be sure, communications hardware remains a large chunk of Cisco’s business.\n\nHowever, Cisco has evolved its operations fairly dramatically in recent years. It has transitioned to a far more subscription-driven recurring revenue model. Increasingly, Cisco layers on higher value-added software and services such as cybersecurity on top of its networking gear.\n\nAs a result, Cisco’s overall business quality has significantly improved. Its revenue streams are more consistent and predictable, and subscription revenues tend to deliver higher profit margins as well.\n\nIn the near-term, hardware sales are down sharply as customers are still absorbing networking equipment bought over the past two years. This has caused CSCO stock to fall to 52-week lows.\n\nShares are a bargain here. Hidden in the negative headlines, in the most recent quarter, Cisco grew total annualized recurring revenues 22% year-over-year to $29.2 billion. Its recent acquisition of Splunk offers Cisco an attractive quickly-growing source of subscription revenues.\n\nNetworking gear is still a cyclical industry and Cisco is currently near the bottom of the cycle. But the company’s long-term outlook remains healthy. With the sell-off, shares go for less than 13 times forward earnings and offer a 3.4% dividend yield.\n\nEndava (DAVA) The logo for Endava (DAVA) displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nEndava (NYSE:DAVA) is an IT consulting shop with a focus on financial services businesses such as insurance, banks and payments processors.\n\nThe core business model at Endava is to provide IT services via outsourcing. Essentially, Endava hires skilled IT workers in lower cost-of-living countries such as Poland, Colombia and Vietnam and uses this workforce to fulfill IT contracts for multinational companies.\n\nEndava has enjoyed tremendous success with this business model. It has tripled revenues and increased profitability dramatically in recent years. In particular, Endava saw outsized growth during the early days of the pandemic as firms rushed to beef up their digital offerings for the rush of e-commerce and app-based financial offerings that took off during this period.\n\nThat digital gold rush has now ended. As the economy reopened, the velocity of new IT and digital evolution spending has slowed. Given Endava’s specific focus on the financial services industry, its clients have been especially hard-hit by the recent jitters in the banking and payments sectors.\n\nAll this has resulted in a full-on collapse in DAVA stock, with shares falling more than 80% peak-to-trough. That’s pretty remarkable given that Endava’s revenues have barely slipped from prior levels and analysts see Endava delivering record top-line results for the fiscal year ending June 2025. This makes DAVA stock a fantastic buy near its all-time low stock price.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen. Growth stocks at 52-week lows\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary third-party graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nThe company’s calling card is its interoperability. Unity is plug-and-play. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly port it across PC, console, mobile and even virtual and augmented reality.\n\nThat last point is a key part of Unity’s appeal. Unity is one of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) primary partners in developing apps for the Apple Vision Pro. Unity is also integral to Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) Oculus ecosystem.\n\nWhile Unity’s technical chops are not in question, the company’s commercial strategy has been less pleasing. Unity has relied heavily on advertising within mobile games to drive revenue, this is a relatively low-quality revenue stream that analysts are nervous about. Unity attempted to raise prices on developers last year, but this caused a firestorm and was walked back.\n\nThat misstep led to Unity’s CEO exiting the company. Matthew Bromberg, a longtime gaming industry executive, comes in as the new Unity head. Fresh leadership and increasing opportunities in the AR/VR arena and the metaverse could be just the thing to help Unity rebound from its current 52-week-low stock price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U and DAVA stock.

        "content": "Riding the coattails of the so-called super investors isn’t a bad strategy so long as you don’t blindly follow their lead. Performing your own due diligence is essential before putting your money at risk. Just because the smart money is buying doesn’t mean it isn’t a dumb investment. Still, plenty of their purchases are solid guru stock picks.\n\nBelow are the three biggest holdings in the portfolio of one of the world’s largest asset management firms, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW). It has almost $816 billion in assets under management (AUM). While it charges fees to its customers for its investment advice, you don’t need to pay for special insider access. Simply look at their latest 13F filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission to see where their money is flowing. It’s not real-time decision-making but it is a way to narrow down the vast universe of stocks into a more manageable set of ideas.\n\nJust make sure you don’t need the money you want to invest to pay for bills or emergencies. With a minimum three to five-year investment horizon, and preferably a decade or more, you might find these stocks Wall Street’s elite are buying are ones you want to piggyback onto as well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough T. Rowe Price money managers have been selling down their stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the past several quarters, they still own an enormous tranche of stock. Apple represents 4.4% of the firm’s total value or some $35.5 billion worth of stock. That equates to 207 million shares.\n\nThat’s about one-quarter of the amount Warren Buffett owns through Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B). And even the Oracle of Omaha has been selling down his shares in the tech giant. Last quarter, he sold about $20 billion worth of shares. It’s not the first time he’s sold his favorite stock, but he usually does it for tax reasons.\n\nStill, T. Rowe Price has an average buy price of $74.71 per share, giving it a nice 156% return on its investment. It might be just taking some profits off the table. Like Buffett, it will probably be holding on for the long haul.\n\nAnd why not? Apple remains a highly profitable company and just announced a huge $110 billion stock buyback program. With its newest iPhone model due out later this year, reportedly possessing new artificial intelligence (AI) features, it could become a hugely popular device.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of AI, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become synonymous with the technology. Whereas it was once the premier videogame chipmaker (it still is), that was long ago overshadowed by its absolute dominance of artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia owns the market for data center graphics processing units (GPU). Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate the chipmaker owns 98% of the market but expects that drop to between 94% and 96%. While rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and even Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) are bringing their chips to market and will eat away at Nvidia’s hold on the space, it will still reign supreme.\n\nT. Rowe Price has also been paring back its position in Nvidia, dropping its holdings from 56.5 million shares a year ago to 46.2 million today. That’s still a whopping $41.7 billion position in the semiconductor stock, good enough for 5.1% of the investment firm’s portfolio.\n\nThere is nothing on the horizon for Nvidia to suggest T. Rowe Price will significantly slash its position. Indeed, with some of the most powerful new chips to ever be created, Nvidia has a large runway of growth still to come though you might want to hold off to see where its first-quarter earnings land the chipmaker.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe biggest holding in T. Rowe Price’s portfolio belongs to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The money manager owns 142.2 million shares at an average buy price of $83.57 per share. That means Microsoft stock weighs in at $59.8 billion, good enough for the top spot and representing 7.3% of total AUM.\n\nMicrosoft has become a premier AI stock in its own right, even if not in the same way that Nvidia is. The tech star became an early adopter of the technology and quickly grasped its importance to the company’s future trajectory. Microsoft integrated AI into all of its products, services and platforms and it continues to explore new ways to exploit it.\n\nMicrosoft is offering for sale to its Azure cloud customers AI chips from AMD as an alternative to Nvidia. It will make available AMD’s MI300X chips, while also selling its own Maia AI chip.  Microsoft will soon introduce a new processor, too, called Cobalt 100, which reportedly offers 40% better performance than competitor designs. And it just announced it was introducing new computers featuring chips that can run A.I. applications natively.\n\nThese are just some of the many good reasons why Microsoft holds such a near and dear position in T. Rowe Price’s portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Fast Track: 7 Stocks That Can Double Your Money in 5 Years",
        "content": "Finding stocks that can double your money in a period of only five years may sound like a tall order. However, it’s quite a reasonable goal, and achievable if you play your cards right (and have some luck). The stock market usually returns 7-8% per year. So, those seeking outsized gains in any five year period will typically have to make extremely risky bets. It takes on average around a decade to double your money in index funds, as a general rule of thumb.\n\nThat said, you can be a bit more aggressive and have a much lower chance of losing your money if you want to double your investment in five years. This can be achieved by investing in well-established businesses with solid growth prospects. You need an annual growth rate of approximately 14.86% to double any amount over five years. The Nasdaq has done better than that over the past five years, so we’re certainly in the right part of the cycle to see such gains in individual stocks!\n\nHere are seven stocks stocks I think have the potential to double your money (or more) in five years’ time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDollar General (DG) Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, midday\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe macro environment may be challenging for some folks right now with less money to spend on non-essentials. However, I believe this won’t deter Dollar General (NYSE:DG) to grow over the long-run. I’ve been very bullish on this stock following its recent sharp decline. That’s because, like most well-established retail companies have done time and time again, I think Dollar General will make a full recovery in the coming years.\n\nThe company’s latest results highlight the resilience of Dollar General’s core business. Same-store sales grew 0.7% just from getting more customers, even with prices rising. This shows that when cash is tight, people still count on Dollar General to help their dollars stretch further.\n\nThe company’s growth plans for 2024 and beyond give me hope that Dollar General can continue gaining more share of the market. With over 2,000 new projects, including 800 stores in new areas, Dollar General is aggressively expanding its footprint to reach more communities. The discount retailer hopes to open 30 new “pOpshelf” stores. Indeed, I think this is a concept that could unlock a new channel for consumers to buy items beyond just essentials.\n\nImportantly, Dollar General’s earnings per share are expected to recover nicely over the coming years.\n\nStory continues DG EPS. stocks that can double your money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFor people with a long-term view, I think this reliable retailer is worth buying right now. If times get tough, this is a stock that has the potential to reward patient investors well over the next five years.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) Advertiser Appeal and Innovations Will Continue to Lift Snap Stock\n\nSource: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou can’t ignore Snap’s (NYSE:SNAP) potential for long-term growth. This Gen-Z app is the next thing that I think will pop when TikTok gets banned. Governments worldwide are laser-focused on getting rid of TikTok, so I think it is only a matter of time until that happens.\n\nBut even without that catalyst, this is a company that’s performing very well. Snap’s Q1 revenue increased 21% year-over-year, and the company saw an 85% surge in the number of small and medium-sized clients using Snapchat ads versus last year. That’s a huge jump! I think we could see a lot of excitement as this company’s growth trend re-ignites. SNAP revenue estimates. Stocks that can double your money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nSnapchat also continues expanding its huge worldwide base of daily visitors, which is now over 422 million people. That’s an impressive 10% increase from 12 months ago. Especially noteworthy is that 75% of 13-34-year-olds in more than 25 nations use Snapchat, and that age group represents over half of the total advertising market. Having such a large percentage of that valuable demographic on your platform is incredibly beneficial for advertisers trying to reach younger audiences.\n\nNow, SNAP stock is very depressed compared to its social media peers. However, that also means it wouldn’t surprise me at all if Snap’s stock value doubles within the next five years as its revenue approaches an estimated $10 billion.\n\nOpera (OPRA) a visualization of Internet communications superimposed on a photo of a city skyline\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOpera (NASDAQ:OPRA) is another Gen-Z stock with very good long-term trends. As I’ve discussed in my previous articles, this company has hit a goldmine with its Opera GX launch. Consumers typically don’t budge when it comes to browsers. Chrome, Safari, and Firefox have continued to dominate, and even Firefox has seen its market share go down over the years. Opera is an old player that has never managed to steal any significant market share, but that has been changing due to its Opera GX gaming browser. This browser provides features like ram limits and network throttling. The latter is very useful when gaming, because it can stop background streaming services on a browser from hogging up bandwidth.\n\nThe company’s total revenue reached $102 million, rising 17% year-over-year. More importantly, the company achieved an adjusted profit margin of 24% on those sales, resulting in $25 million in EBITDA. For investors seeking income, OPRA stock also provides a healthy 3% dividend yield.\n\nAverage annual revenue per user (ARPU) jumped 24% to $1.34. Search advertising through the company’s partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), was up 14%, and other online ads surged 21%, indicate that focusing on high-quality users is paying off.\n\nTwo recent changes could really turbocharge Opera’s growth in the years ahead. First, the company’s ongoing innovations to its browser experience make it very appealing. Secondly, new rules in the European Union aim to loosen the grip companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have by requiring alternative options to be offered. Indeed, after those rules took effect, Opera clearly benefited with a 63% spike in new iOS users in the EU in Q1. While still small today, Opera’s runway for growth looks substantial.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese stocks are trading at dirt-cheap prices, and I think you should pounce on the opportunity as many have started to make a turnaround. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is arguably the best Chinese tech stock. While the company’s revenue growth seems slow, Baidu’s cloud computing division is starting to pick up steam. It is one of the only big companies Chinese customers can turn to for cloud and AI services.\n\nBut by far, Baidu’s biggest bet is ERNIE. Rolling this platform out across all of Baidu could be a real game-changer, but it will take time to implement everywhere. In the short run, the mobile phone business may still have some challenges until the AI becomes fully integrated in a few years.\n\nOn the bright side, ERNIE AI is growing fast based on the released API call numbers we have. If the company can continue expanding its application set, improved model performance could open up big monetization opportunities down the road.\n\nWhile the AI transition plays out, holding the line on costs seems to be paying off based on the non-GAAP operating margin Baidu has reported. If Baidu sustains this momentum with AI tailwinds, I think it is a solid candidate to be a stock that can double your money.\n\nLiberty Broadband Corporation (LBRDA) rural broadband: a cell phone tower over a long stretch of hills and forest\n\nSource: Steve Heap / Shutterstock\n\nLiberty Broadband’s (NASDAQ:LBRDA) Q1 results were a mixed bag. The company’s earnings per share of $1.69 missed analysts’ forecasts by 27 cents, and revenue of $245 million was slightly below expectations. However, I remain optimistic about the company’s long-term prospects.\n\nCharter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), in which Liberty Broadband owns a significant stake, continues navigating current industry challenges. Even with a loss of 72,000 customers, possibly due to increased competition and changes to a federal program, Charter still achieved solid 2.8% growth in EBITDA through smart cost control. Another bright spot is their mobile business, where Charter passed 8 million customer lines and service revenue accelerated 38% year-over-year.\n\nLiberty Broadband itself ended Q1 with $108 million in cash and equivalents. While the company is currently under the 26% Charter ownership cap, share repurchases should resume this summer. Near-term, debt reduction may take precedence over buybacks.\n\nAll told, I believe Liberty Broadband’s stake in Charter positions it well for the long haul. Analysts seem bullish on this stock, too. LBRDA price targets. Stocks that can double your money\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nW.P. Carey (WPC) Factory pipes and towers at sunset\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nW.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) seems to be excelling in all aspects of their business currently, and there appears to be potential for significant future growth. However, the most attractive thing with this company is its impressive 5.76% dividend yield that should complement stock gains very well going forward. In my view, WPC stock is definitely a top option for investors looking to double their money over the next five years.\n\nIn Q1, W.P. Carey completed $375 million worth of investments, mostly in industrial properties. Importantly, 70% of these deals were located in Europe, where the company has a cost advantage for taking out loans. Their projections to make over $700 million in additional deals in short order is a very encouraging sign for investors worried about the ability of this company to continue to grow.\n\nI’m especially impressed with the initial returns W.P. Carey is projected to earn. The company’s management team expects an average 7.4% rate of cash flow to the initial investment amount. Additionally, expected returns are estimated to be 9% overall per investment, once you also factor in regular rental income increases. This seems to be a conservative forecast, even considering today’s high inflation, since it only bakes in 2% for rising costs when prices have been climbing much faster.\n\nW.P.Carey’s business model stands out in its sector. It has lease agreements on 99.6% of its properties, including guaranteed minimum annual rent hikes of at least 3%. With close to $1 billion available in cash reserves and unused credit lines, this company appears well-equipped to pursue new deals proactively without struggling for funding the way some competitors face challenges.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is by far the riskiest bet on this list. I rarely cover lithium stocks and companies that have big exposure to volatile commodities. However, lithium has found very strong support recently, and has actually moved up a little this year. So, I think buying up Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) makes sense before EV sales pick up steam in the coming quarters after interest rate cuts materialize.\n\nAlbermarle’s revenue declined 47% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, slightly missing estimates. However, adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents beat expectations by $0.03.\n\nManagement has already achieved over $90 million in cost savings this quarter, and is on track to deliver more than $280 million in savings for the entire year. At the same time, Albemarle’s lithium volumes are expanding as key projects like Kemerton I and Meishan ramp up. Analysts expect a big rebound next year. If that materializes, the stock could recover substantially. This makes me believe it is one of the stocks that can double your money over the next five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaway meeting: Check Capital Management CEO shares his thoughts",
        "content": "The annual Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Shareholder Meeting, a pivotal event in the investment community, is eagerly awaited each year.\n\nFollowing the 2024 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Meeting on May 4, Steve Check, an investment professional and the CEO of Check Capital Management, spoke with Investing.com to provide his expert insights.\n\nBuffett’s Possible New Value Proposition\n\nWhen asked about what Berkshire Hathaway’s next potential big bet could be, Check said the deals tend to come out of left field. However, he didn’t rule out the possibility of a next big bet, stating that “there are still some large family-owned businesses that could someday be acquired.”\n\nHe highlighted names such as Mars, Chick-fil-A and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, although noting that the odds are low.\n\n“There are still some large publicly traded targets,” added Check. “In either case, price will ultimately drive Berkshire’s decision-making. If they can’t find attractively priced deals, Berkshire will repurchase its own shares or (someday) pay a dividend.”\n\nDespite artificial intelligence being the segment at the forefront of investors' minds Buffett has said previously that he doesn't invest in what he doesn't understand, with AI fitting that definition.\n\nCheck isn’t surprised. Despite Buffett being a “learning machine,” he hasn’t historically invested in nascent technologies, although Check added that Berkshire companies, like GEICO, BNSF, etc. are definitely experimenting with and using AI.\n\nOne position where Buffett didn’t do too well recently was in Paramount. At the annual meeting, he said they “lost quite a bit of money.”\n\nHowever, Check considers it a “nonevent,” with an estimated loss of less than 1% of Berkshire’s net worth.\n\n“Also, the loss will help offset taxes owed on the realized Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gain,” he states. “Buffett has never and will never bat 1.000. Thankfully, to be a very successful investor, you don’t need to be perfect.”\n\nFocusing on Apple, and Berkshire Hathaway selling some shares of the iPhone maker, Check trusts Buffett’s judgment.\n\n“He was smart to buy it, and he was smart to hold it. If he thinks now is the time to sell some shares, it’s probably a smart idea too,” he added. “Apple grew to become a very large percentage of Berkshire’s net worth – approximately 31% – and the valuation seemed more than reasonable at a P/E of 30x.”\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Stock Forecast 2024\n\nIn a note late last year, analysts at UBS described Berkshire Hathaway shares as “attractive” in an uncertain economic environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the note, the bank's analysts raised their price target for Berkshire Hathaway class B shares to $414 from $405, adding that they believe the stock trades at around an 11% discount to its intrinsic value. The UBS analysts also raised their price target for Berkshire's Class A shares to $621,591 from $608,000.\n\nLearn More About Berkshire Hathaway\n\nDiscover why Berkshire Hathaway is the gold standard in investment.

        "title": "Xiaomi Raises Sales Target for Marquee EV in Sign of Confidence",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Xiaomi Corp. aims to deliver 120,000 of its SU7 electric-vehicles this year, hiking its initial targets for a car it hopes can someday compete with Tesla Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Stock Surges as Sales Forecast Delivers on AI Hopes These Flight Routes Suffer the World’s Worst Turbulence Citi Trader Got 711 Warning Messages Before Sparking Flash Crash Harvard Defies Faculty Vote to Block 13 Students From Graduating US Justice Department to Seek Breakup of Live Nation-Ticketmaster\n\nThe company disclosed its latest goal in a press statement issued after reporting its fastest pace of quarterly revenue growth in more than two years, reflecting an improving smartphone market. Revenue rose a faster-than-expected 27% to 75.51 billion yuan ($10.4 billion) in the March quarter, about 2.7% above the average estimate.\n\nXiaomi’s raised target suggests billionaire co-founder Lei Jun is confident of making headway in his $10 billion foray into the crowded electric car market. His company unveiled the SU7 in late March, and later said he expected to deliver more than 100,000 of the vehicles. As of the end of April, orders for the SU7 series neared 90,000, with 10,000 delivered as of mid-May.\n\n“The group has set a target to deliver 120,000 vehicles of the Xiaomi SU7 Series this year and planned to start double shift production in June,” Xiaomi said in its statement.\n\nXiaomi, which gets more than 60% of its revenue from smartphones, has been trying to diversify in part because of sluggish device demand in its home market. On Thursday, it reported a 1% slide in net income to 4.2 billion yuan for the March quarter.\n\nStill, signs point toward a gradual mobile recovery in China and beyond. Smartphone unit shipments at Xiaomi grew by nearly 34% last quarter amid a broader market bounceback, narrowing the gap with market leaders Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc., according to market tracker IDC. Apple’s global iPhone shipments slid more than expected as sales flagged in China.\n\nThe company is also developing a sport utility vehicle similar to Tesla’s Model Y, aiming to launch sales as early as 2025, according to people familiar with the matter. The EV business may make up a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the company’s revenue in 2024, said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Steven Tseng and Sean Chen.\n\nRead More: Apple Faces Worst iPhone Slump Since Covid as Rivals Rise\n\n--With assistance from Ville Heiskanen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won The Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn’t The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Its Wing subsidiary will also assemble drones in Tamil Nadu, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.\n\nGoogle is accelerating its plans to manufacture devices in India, following companies such as Apple Inc. in pivoting away from China to lessen geopolitical risks. The company’s decision benefits Tamil Nadu, which is seeking to get into advanced manufacturing and move away from the historical tag line “Detroit of India.”\n\nA team from the Tamil Nadu government, comprising Minister for Industries T.R.B. Rajaa and senior executives, held talks with senior Google management in the US to pitch their state as a manufacturing location, the people said.\n\nGoogle representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "title": "Taiwan's prized semiconductors not unbreakable 'silicon shield' they once were as mainland China, West develop own bargaining chips",
        "content": "A sharp decline in Taiwan's ties with mainland China could extend to the very devices being used to transmit and read this story.\n\nThe far-reaching implications from what has been a geopolitical tug of war are ultimately likely to bolster mainland China's standing as a dominant supplier of older-model semiconductors while ramping up the need for Western allies to rely more on themselves for cutting-edge chips - a scenario that industry insiders say threatens to erode Taiwan's formidable \"silicon shield\" that has long afforded the island a privileged position in the global supply chain.\n\nThe island's continued production of nine in 10 of the world's advanced chips at factories is unmatched anywhere, and it helped earn Taiwan that defensible sobriquet around the turn of the century.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nBut in recent years, mainland China has invested heavily to move up the value chain for critically important chips that power everything from cellphones and other consumer devices to electric cars and applications for AI and quantum computing.\n\nAnd now, mounting tensions across the Taiwan Strait - which intensified following the inauguration of William Lai on Monday as Taiwan's leader - are pushing the West to diversify advanced chips away from Taiwan and to their own homelands in case any cross-Strait conflict threatens to end the island's economic advantages.\n\nLai represents a Taiwanese political party that is cold to mainland China. He said in his inauguration speech that mainland China's effort to \"swallow up\" Taiwan would \"not disappear\" until the island gave in.\n\n\"Uncertainties surrounding Taiwan's economic future, security and geopolitical risks necessitate vigilant monitoring,\" Saxo Capital Markets economist Redmond Wong said in a January research note. \"The fate of Taiwan's 'silicon shield' is uncertain as economic interdependence encounters obstacles.\"\n\nTwelve of Taiwan's top-20 export items last year were hi-tech products, including integrated circuits - another term for chips - and printed circuits, according to the International Trade Administration in Taipei. About one-third of printed circuit boards come out of Taiwan, and the island remains a leading source of camera lenses used in iPhones.\n\nStory continues\n\nNearly 60 per cent of Taiwan's semiconductors were sold to mainland China in 2023. But that once-brisk trade has fallen over the past two years amid growing political frictions. And in the first quarter of 2024, the US overtook mainland China as Taiwan's top export destination.\n\nThe mere spectre of a rapid decline in cross-Strait ties, including a possible military blockade of Taiwan by the mainland, has already got Japan, the US and Germany interested over the past few years in onshoring the production of Taiwan's prized chips.\n\nThose countries are responding to the \"concentration of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in Taiwan\", according to data from Taipei-based market-research firm TrendForce.\n\nFearing that Taiwanese supplies could become inaccessible in the wake of a cross-Strait conflict, government policymakers around the world have been discussing how advanced chips could be made domestically.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwanese firms have looked abroad for manufacturing opportunities. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) - the world's largest contract chipmaker - struck a deal worth US$11.6 billion to make advanced chips in the US state of Arizona. TSMC says it has invested more than US$65 billion in Arizona, and Washington has rewarded that initiative with US$6.6 billion in direct funding.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that TSMC and ASML Holding had ways to remotely disable their most advanced chipmaking machines with a kill switch that could be activated if the mainland military were at their doorstep - a potential scenario as Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China to be reunited, by force if necessary.\n\nCountries that have diplomatic ties with Beijing, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state. They acknowledge the existence of the one-China principle that holds Taiwan be part of China, but may not explicitly agree with it. Washington opposes any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\n\nHowever, those weapon sales have not included some of the most advanced military equipment, including F-35 fighter jets, which are run on TSMC computer chips.\n\nTrendForce notes that while Taiwan is currently the dominant advanced chipmaker, accounting for 66 per cent of global capacity, offshore investments made or pledged by TSMC since 2021 have shown how that dominance may be waning. The research firm expects that Taiwan's share of the world's advance-chipmaking market will decline to 55 per cent by 2027.\n\nThe US$166.63 billion value of Taiwan's chip exports last year marked a 9.5 per cent year-on-year decline, according to International Trade Administration data.\n\nAnd over time, the US and Japan will have \"more of an advantage\", with Japan especially set to \"become much more significant\", said Mario Morales, group vice-president for semiconductor research with Silicon Valley-based market analysis firm IDC.\n\nThose types of patterns are widely seen to be positioning Taiwan's Western allies as front runners in cutting-edge technology.\n\nApple's shift in its supply chains shows a dilution of Taiwanese prominence in high-end tech supplies. Chinese camera module maker Cowell E Holdings and Shenzhen Desay Battery Technology, which provides lithium batteries, both supply Apple, and the Silicon Valley juggernaut said last year that it would source more of its iPhone batteries from India.\n\nThe assembly of iPhones and iPads is still largely done by Taiwanese companies, such as Pegatron and Foxconn Technology, but the manufacturing work takes place in mainland China, reducing the risk of disruption from any cross-Strait upsets.\n\nAt the same time, Apple sources the assembly of AirPods and watches chiefly to a Shenzhen-based company, Luxshare Precision Industry. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in October that 95 per cent of his company's products were still made in China, according to the TechNode media outlet.\n\nMeanwhile, US-centric nearshoring efforts - including TSMC's agreement to make chips in Arizona - could potentially shrink Taiwan's share of the world's chip production to 50 per cent in just three to four years, forecasts Douglas Kent, an executive vice-president with the US-based Association for Supply Chain Management.\n\nReshoring reflects worries among American chip buyers about a Taiwan conflict with mainland China, Kent said.\n\n\"It's pretty serious,\" he warned. \"Most organisations are looking at supply-diversity strategies in case China does prove to be more aggressive than they have been thus far.\"\n\nAnd secondary concerns, he said, include natural disasters such as earthquakes. Taiwan remains a hotspot for typhoons and seismic activity - seen just last month when a magnitude 7.3 quake destroyed several buildings and killed at least 18 people. Occasional droughts could also threaten the water supplies of chipmakers but have not dented production.\n\nAny reshoring of chip production to hedge against cross-Strait problems would focus on advanced chips rather than older models, Kent said.\n\n\"The speed of the semiconductor market is pretty swift,\" he said. \"I think, absolutely, the investment should be in the leading-edge chips.\"\n\nJapan has already grown more \"assertive\" as a chip seller, according to an April 8 research paper by a Singapore-based think tank, the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS).\n\nTrendForce also noted how Japan plans to support a local company, Rapidus, as it strives for the most advanced chipmaking process available today. And the research firm highlighted plans to build a \"semiconductor cluster\" in Hokkaido with the help of government subsidies.\n\nOn the other side of the strait, mainland China's capacity to make what the industry calls \"mature\" semiconductors is growing after years of state investment in the tiny components for PCs, electric vehicles and internet-linked household devices. Mature chips have been around for years, if not decades, and run a range of common electronics, leaving what the industry calls \"advanced\" chips to power modern hi-tech goods such as AI-optimised phones.\n\nTrendForce data also projects that mainland China's chipmaking capacity will keep rising in the coming few years - with its share of the world's mature chip capacity potentially reaching 39 per cent by 2027, up from 26 per cent in 2022.\n\nTo steel itself against US curbs on Chinese access to foreign technology, China is pouring several billion dollars into nurturing a tech industry like that of Japan or South Korea.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security barred mainland China from obtaining advanced semiconductors, technology and related equipment in 2022. Last year, the administration of US President Joe Biden signed an order that curbed China-bound investment in semiconductors, quantum information and artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd just last week, Washington proposed raising import tariffs on Chinese semiconductors from 25 per cent to 50 per cent by next year.\n\n\"The mainland seems determined to focus on domestic production to gradually move towards self-reliance amid the ongoing trade war with the United States,\" the RSIS research paper said.\n\nAt a broader level, Beijing is shifting away from a traditional labour-intensive manufacturing centre, with hi-tech products accounting for an ever-growing share of exports.\n\nLast year, 13 of mainland China's top-20 export items were hi-tech products, including smartphones, lithium-ion batteries and integrated circuits, according to customs data.\n\nSunstar, a 20-year-old wireless earphone maker in Shenzhen, already finds Chinese chips cheaper than those made by US-based industry trendsetter Qualcomm, though the \"quality is not so high\", sales representative Hera Chen said in April at a Hong Kong tech show - InnoEx 2024.\n\nMainland Chinese makers of devices such as wireless earphones, smartwatches and TV-related gear said at the tech show that they seldom worry about chip supplies because the home market is so flush with supplies.\n\n\"Our chips are not so advanced - they're mature ones, so we have a supply, and the threats [of supply disruption] aren't too real for us,\" said Chen Sen, a sales director of Huawei, which provides chips for the S52 smartwatches made by United Wealth Holdings.\n\nUnited Wealth Holdings and Huawei displayed the bulky, multicoloured smartwatches at InnoEx to compete with Apple's watches in terms of design and battery life.\n\nChina accounted for almost half of the world's smartphone output and around 70 per cent of lithium-ion battery production last year. The US is China's largest buyer of both items, according to customs data and market research firm Statista.\n\nBut shifting supplies of advanced chips away from Taiwan will take several quarters or even years, said Ben Yeh, a mobility analyst with the market research firm Canalys.\n\nAdvanced technology requires a supply of talent, and electronics firms that buy chips may find it expensive to switch sellers.\n\n\"The fact remains that the most advanced manufacturing processes are predominantly concentrated in Taiwan,\" Yeh said. \"Although competitors like Intel and Samsung might gain from order transfers, the global supply-chain disruptions, along with issues related to war and sanctions, would present significant obstacles to their manufacturing and supply capabilities, making it difficult to assert that anyone could benefit from such a situation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, despite the threats associated with offshoring, Taiwan is still manoeuvring to grow as a chip hub beyond its manufacturing might.\n\nThe island is aiming to become a base for research and development, design centres, and tech company headquarters, forecast Hu Jin-li, a professor with the Institute of Business and Management at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei.\n\n\"If a balance of the superpowers can be achieved intentionally or naturally, Taiwan may become a technology hub of the AI, IT, and integrated-circuit industries that every superpower wants and needs,\" Hu said. \"In this case, both [mainland] China and the West want to keep Taiwan on its own side.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The U.S. economy has a century-long track record of producing the world's most valuable companies:\n\nUnited States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901. By 1955, General Motors became the first $10 billion company. Industrial giant General Electric rode its portfolio of businesses -- from aerospace to financial services -- to a $100 billion valuation in 1995. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) crossed the next big threshold in 2018 when it became the first publicly traded company to amass a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nToday, Apple is joined by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club. But I think one more company is on the cusp of earning membership.\n\nWarren Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) to a whopping 4,384,748% return since 1965, giving it a valuation of nearly $900 billion. The conglomerate owns substantial positions in private and public success stories like GEICO, Coca-Cola, and even Apple.\n\nHere's why Berkshire could become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club within the next 12 months. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA master class in keeping it simple\n\nBuffett is a quintessential value investor. He likes to buy good businesses at a cheap price, and sometimes great businesses at a fair price, with the intention of holding on to them for decades. He looks for companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes businesses that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nHere's an example that perfectly displays the effects of compounding that helped Buffett build his empire. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) between 1991 and 1995. That holding has grown in value to a staggering $36.8 billion today. Even better, Amex stock makes Berkshire money just for owning it, paying Berkshire $364 million in dividends in 2023 alone. That dividend means Berkshire recoups its entire initial investment in Amex every four years just from the dividends. That's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\n\nBerkshire owns a long list of high-quality companies\n\nBerkshire was originally a textiles business, and it was on the verge of failure when Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965. When he realized he couldn't turn it around, he transformed it into a holding company for various investments.\n\nSince then, Berkshire has purchased many companies outright, including GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. But it also owns a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities worth $377.9 billion. This portfolio includes its shares of Amex, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is Berkshire's single largest holding, with a value of $149.9 billion accounting for 39.7% of its stock portfolio. It would be even larger, but the conglomerate recently sold 13% of its position (reportedly for tax reasons). Considering Berkshire only spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, this investment has seriously paid off.\n\nI want to take a moment to highlight the Coca-Cola stake, too. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion buying shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it has never sold any of them. Today, that position is worth $25.2 billion, and it paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023 alone.\n\nYou might notice the Coca-Cola story sounds very similar to the Amex story, and its is. What it points out is that Buffett didn't catch lightning in a bottle, nor is his strategy exceptional. In fact, Berkshire's long-term positions in Bank of America, Visa, and Moody's followed a similar trajectory, thanks to Buffett's simple formula centered around patient investing.\n\nIf investors are willing to maintain a long-term view, they can also reap the benefits of compounding in the same way.\n\nBerkshire's market-beating returns are supported by strong financial growth\n\nBerkshire Class A shares soared in value by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023. That translates into a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the 10.2% average annual return in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nThe outperformance is mind-boggling in dollar terms. An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $43.8 million at the end of 2023! The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $312,230.\n\nBerkshire has the financial results to support its incredible returns. The business generated $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, a figure which grew to $364.4 billion last year. Berkshire's diverse portfolio of businesses contributed to the latter number: $83.4 billion came from insurance premiums; $101.4 billion came from its railroad, utilities, and energy businesses; and $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various entities under Berkshire's umbrella.\n\nBerkshire also grew its net earnings from just $2.3 million in 1965 to a whopping $96.2 billion in 2023.\n\nBerkshire could join the $1 trillion club within a year\n\nConsidering Berkshire has a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion as of this writing, its stock only needs to gain 11% from here to catapult the company into the $1 trillion club. Its 58-year-long track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns (on average) suggests it's a shoo-in to get there within the next 12 months.\n\nA few things will work in Berkshire's favor going forward. For starters, Apple just announced a $100 billion stock buyback, which is the largest in the history of corporate America. That will organically increase the conglomerate's equity stake in the iPhone maker. Plus, top holdings like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola continue to raise their dividends, so Berkshire will likely earn a record payout this year.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also likely to cut interest rates in the second half of 2024. That could spark an increase in economic activity which should boost many of the businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, especially those serving consumers and those in the transport and logistics industries.\n\nFinally, Buffett continues to be a big believer in the company's future. He authorized the repurchase of $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023 and a further $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Buffett has now overseen $71.4 billion worth of share repurchases since 2020 alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\n\nAbsent any external economic shocks, Berkshire appears almost certain to be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club in the coming year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "You may not realize it, but last week marked one of the most important data releases of the quarter for investors -- and I'm not talking about the highly anticipated April inflation report.\n\nMay 15 was the deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F allows investors to look over the proverbial shoulders of Wall Street's greatest investors to see what they were buying and selling in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ended in March).\n\nSince the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been credited with pushing the broad-market indexes to record highs, it's only logical to examine how Wall Street's smartest billionaire investors approached these companies in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country today, including:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nWhat these stocks share in common is a massive outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 over the trailing-10-year period, along with well-defined competitive advantages. For instance, Alphabet's Google has maintained at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back nine years. Meanwhile, Apple has the most robust capital-return program on the planet among publicly traded companies. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, it's repurchased $674 billion of its own stock. Buybacks of this magnitude can provide a hearty lift to earnings per share.\n\nHowever, billionaires have very different outlooks for these seven stocks. Based on the latest round of 13Fs, billionaires dumped shares of two Magnificent Seven stocks, while absolutely piling into another.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires sent to the chopping block: Nvidia\n\nThe first member of the Magnificent Seven that prominent billionaire investors seemingly wanted nothing to do with in the first quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia. Just as we witnessed during the fourth quarter, eight well-known billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would billionaires sell what's arguably been the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street? Aside from simple profit-taking, there are a few potential red flags that Wall Street's brightest investors may be focusing on.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia is set to face increased competition from all angles. Although it's well publicized that external competitors will be vying for graphics processing unit (GPU) market share in AI-accelerated data centers this year, the bigger threat may come from Nvidia's own top customers.\n\nInterestingly, Magnificent Seven components Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four top customers -- about 40% of net sales. Each of these companies is developing their own AI-GPUs to deploy in collaboration with Nvidia's H100 GPUs in their high-compute data centers. The internal development of AI-GPUs from other Magnificent Seven businesses strongly suggests that we're witnessing a peak in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nHistory has also been incredibly unkind to next-big-thing investment trends. Over the last three decades, there hasn't been a buzzy innovation or trend that didn't undergo a bubble-bursting event fairly early into its existence. Investors commonly overestimate the uptake and enterprise adoption of new technologies, which leads to bubbles. If the artificial intelligence bubble were to follow history and burst, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia, which saw its sales more than double last year because of AI-GPU demand.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires showed to the door: Meta Platforms\n\nThe second surprising Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires were casting aside during the quarter ended in March is social media juggernaut Meta Platforms. Nine successful billionaires -- or 10, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Meta stock, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,259,650 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,313,528 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,164,151 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (779,637 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (735,911 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (727,500 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (175,614 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (29,157 shares)\n\nThe top reason behind this selling was very likely profit-taking. Since hitting its bear market low in 2022, shares of Meta had gained close to 500%.\n\nBillionaires may also have been leery about Meta's somewhat unpredictable capital expenditure forecasts. Shares came under pressure in 2022 because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's desire to spend on the metaverse and augmented/virtual reality innovations. They began rallying in a big way last year when spending forecasts were reined in a bit. But based on Meta's 2024 guidance, it appears as if Zuckerberg and his team are willing to aggressively spend, once again, on AI and other innovations that may not have a sizable payoff for years to come.\n\nThe third possibility for this selling activity might be concern about the health of the U.S. economy. Meta generates nearly 98% of its sales from advertising, and ad spending is highly cyclical. The stock market is incredibly pricey at the moment, and a historic decline in M2 money supply -- the first since the Great Depression -- suggests a recession might occur in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBut unlike Nvidia, I believe billionaires will regret paring down their stakes in Meta. It owns the top social media assets worldwide (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger), and has been able to sustain strong ad pricing power in most economic climates. Meta remains one of the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks, based on forward-year cash flow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire investors can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nWhile trading activity in the Magnificent Seven leaned decisively to the sell side with Nvidia and Meta, and was mixed with other constituents, the one member that billionaires absolutely couldn't stop buying is e-commerce leader Amazon. Nine billionaire investors were willing buyers of Amazon stock during the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough Amazon is best-known for its world-leading online marketplace, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income and cash flow from a couple of its faster-growing ancillary segments. It's these ancillary operations that likely attracted billionaires to buy shares of Amazon hand over fist during the March-ended quarter.\n\nArguably no operating segment is more important than cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, and is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. Best of all, cloud-service margins are significantly higher than online retail margins, which means AWS typically accounts for a majority of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAdvertising services and subscription services are holding their own, as well, with sustained double-digit sales growth. Amazon draws more than 2 billion people to its site each month, which affords it exceptional ad-pricing power. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscriptions in April 2021 and has likely added to this total since securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football.\n\nThe final selling point for billionaires might be Amazon's valuation. Since Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is a far better valuation metric than the traditional price-to-earnings ratio. After spending the entirety of the 2010s at a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow, Amazon can be purchased right now for just 12.4 times consensus cash flow for 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) Can Still Rise Despite Sitting at the Top",
        "content": "Numero Uno stock Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a $3 trillion market cap, has delivered a return of around 1,154% over the last decade. Sitting at the top of the global stock markets, will it continue to give similar returns in the next decade? I believe the answer is yes. Microsoft’s consistently strong performance, cloud & AI-driven tailwinds, and robust margins despite substantial AI investments make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll take advantage of any market weakness in the coming months to purchase MSFT.\n\nMicrosoft’s Recent Results Were Strong Yet Again\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft reported impressive Fiscal Q3 results for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all business segments. Q3 adjusted earnings of $2.94 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $2.82 per share. Also, earnings jumped 20% year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.45 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, revenues soared 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion. The Intelligent Cloud business segment, encompassing Azure Cloud, SQL Server, and Windows, among others, grew 23% year-over-year to $26.7 billion, beating expectations yet again. The much-watched segment now comprises 35% of total revenues, with AI playing a significant role as a catalyst driving growth.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of AI by businesses, there is a substantial demand for Microsoft’s Azure and related cloud services. Not surprisingly, Azure and other cloud services witnessed solid revenue growth of 31% (28% in constant currency), significantly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nDespite the strong Q3 performance, Microsoft provided a conservative outlook, slightly below expectations. Fiscal Q4 revenues are projected to be $64 billion compared to consensus expectations of $64.5 billion, with Azure revenues expected to grow between 30% and 31%.\n\nOn a positive note, Microsoft offered its FY2025 outlook, anticipating double-digit growth in both revenues and operating income. This forecast reassures investors of the company’s sustained growth trajectory.\n\nAI Will Continue to Act as a Long-Term Catalyst for MSFT\n\nAI has propelled Microsoft to become the largest stock in the world, and it will continue to be the driving force behind its growth story in the coming decade. Microsoft’s early investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT has positioned it ahead of other tech giants.\n\nThe demand for AI remains insatiable, with Microsoft management stating that it exceeds available capacity. This high demand drives continuous heavy investment in AI by Microsoft and other tech titans.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s AI investment plans align with those of its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the space. For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported CAPEX (capital expenditures) of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) spent $6.72 billion. Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Microsoft reported a 22% sequential jump in CAPEX (including finance leases) to $14 billion versus $11.5 billion in the prior quarter. The majority of that amount is assigned to scaling its AI infrastructure and securing processors from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for running large AI models.\n\nIncreasing CAPEX may impact margins. However, Microsoft’s management is taking the initiative to keep costs low and protect margins. For instance, newer and more efficient AI products like GPT-4o and Mai-1 are expected to increase scale and keep costs under control. Furthermore, Mai-1 will compete with major rivals, namely Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nAzure AI Services, which includes AI training and other AI-related services, is experiencing remarkable growth. Azure competes directly with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Google’s cloud business and is closely watched by investors. Notably, Azure AI Services is now estimated to be an over $4 billion run rate business. For comparison (although not a direct comparison), Amazon’s AWS has reached a $100 billion annual run rate. This underscores the substantial opportunity for Azure powered by AI in the coming years.\n\nDuring the earnings call, management confirmed that Azure continues to gain market share, with 65% of Fortune 500 companies using Azure Open AI. There’s a clear acceleration in Azure’s growth, marked by the signing of large deals across several diverse industries, with names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) being added to its clientele. Azure will likely continue to see the growth momentum with increased market share gains in the coming months.\n\nFurther, Microsoft 365 Copilot (AI-backed online assistant) is showing steady adoption. Management stated that 60% of Fortune 500 companies now use the Copilot AI program. The company remains optimistic about its growing contribution to revenues in the coming years.\n\nIt’s not just Azure and Copilot. Microsoft’s AI investments and capabilities are expected to boost revenues and profitability across other product portfolios, such as GitHub, Fabric, and Security.\n\nOn a separate note, MSFT’s acquisition of gaming software rival Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) will continue to add to MSFT’s diversified revenue stream. Microsoft recently announced the unveiling of its own mobile store game, equivalent to Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store and Google’s Play Store.\n\nMicrosoft’s Valuation Isn’t Cheap but Isn’t Expensive Either\n\nDespite being the most valuable stock in the world, Microsoft’s valuation isn’t as expensive as one would think. At first glance, It may look expensive, trading at a forward P/E of 37x currently. Nonetheless, I believe the premium is justified, given its favorable industry-leading market position, robust margins, diversified revenue stream, and huge exposure to high-growth AI and cloud businesses.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, online retail and cloud computing giant Amazon is trading at a P/E of 51x, while social networking company Meta Platforms is trading at a 27x P/E.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Microsoft stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the earnings report. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past month. Microsoft stock’s average price target of $491.56 implies 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider Buying MSFT for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm, and Microsoft continues to lead the charge. Microsoft’s early investments in AI have positioned it as a frontrunner in the industry, yielding significant rewards. I believe that Microsoft’s GenAI innovations will continue to drive revenues, profits, and cash flows in the coming years.\n\nWith a long runway for growth and profitability ahead, Microsoft remains a compelling investment. I plan to keep adding MSFT to my portfolio, taking advantage of any market weaknesses in the coming months.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "'Demand is just so strong': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang tells Yahoo Finance supply can't keep up",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang doesn't lack demand. What he lacks is supply.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's first quarter earnings report Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.\n\n\"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\"\n\nNvidia is transitioning from its current Hopper AI platform to its more advanced Blackwell system. Ahead of the company's results on Wednesday, some analysts on Wall Street had raised questions about whether some customers would be more cautious with Hopper orders ahead of the more Blackwell units later this year.\n\n\"Hopper demand grew throughout this quarter — after we announced Blackwell — and so that kind of tells you how much demand there is out there,\" Huang said.\n\nHuang added that demand for both platforms will outstrip supply well into next year, with the complexity of these chips also challenging the company's efforts to keep pace.\n\n\"Every component, every part of our data center, is the most complex computer the world's ever made,\" Huang said. \"And so it's sensible that almost everything is constrained.\"\n\nFor the first quarter, Nvidia reported results that topped Wall Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a 461% and 262% jump from the prior year, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income tallied $18.1 billion in the first quarter. Nvidia's quarterly results topped expectations again on Wednesday. (Source: Company Filings)\n\nIn the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to reach $28 billion plus or minus 2%. That’s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected.\n\nThe company also announced a 10-to-1 stock split — in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own — that will go into effect June 10 for shareholders as of June 7.\n\nNvidia also joined its Big Tech peers in boosting its quarterly dividend, with shareholders now set to receive a dividend of $0.10 per share, up from $0.04.\n\nNvidia stock rose as much as 6% in extended trading on Wednesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangs speaks at the company's office in Santa Clara, Calif., April 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nHuang also discussed how Nvidia will navigate the transition from AI training, in which companies train AI models, to AI inferencing, where those same companies deploy models for customers to use.\n\nQuestions have swirled about whether large-scale cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) would drop Nvidia's chips for inferencing in favor of their own offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Huang sees Nvidia's offerings being just as powerful for inference as they are for training.\n\n\"We have a great position in inference, because inference is just a really complicated problem,\" he said.\n\n\"The software stack is complicated. The type of models that people use is complicated. The vast majority of inferencing today is done on Nvidia. And so, we expect that to continue.\"\n\nThe CEO also touched on the growth the company is seeing in sales to customers beyond major cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, saying that companies ranging from Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) to pharmaceutical firms are increasingly buying up Nvidia chips. In fact, the biggest industry using Nvidia's data-center chip, excluding the cloud companies. is automotive.\n\n\"Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\" Huang said. \"But every single car, someday we will have to have autonomous capability.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Apple exec acknowledges shortcomings in effort to bring competition in iPhone app payments",
        "content": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Longtime Apple executive Phil Schiller on Wednesday acknowledged a court-ordered makeover of the U.S. payment system in its iPhone app store hasn't done much to increase competition — a shortcoming that could result in a federal judge demanding more changes.\n\nSchiller, who has been overseeing the iPhone app store since its inception in 2008, made the admission during occasionally sheepish testimony about the new payment options that so far have been shunned by all but a few dozen apps since their introduction in January.\n\n“We have worked hard to create this program and I think we need to do a lot more to do to get developers,” Schiller said. “There is work in front of us to make that happen.”\n\nSchiller's appearance came two weeks into ongoing hearings being held in Oakland, California, federal court to determine whether Apple is properly adhering to an order issued as part of an antitrust case alleging its iPhone app store had turned into an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlthough U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected the monopoly claims made by Epic Games, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options.\n\nThat shake-up threatens to undercut Apple's own lucrative in-house payment system, which generates billions of dollars annually through commissions ranging from 15% to 30% of the purchase amount on digital transactions completed within iPhone apps.\n\nAfter more than two years of ultimately unsuccessful attempts to overturn the order to allow alternative payment links within apps, Apple in January complied with the requirement. As part of the change, Apple set up an application process to approve links to alternative payment systems and imposed fees of 12% to 27% when users clicked on those options.\n\nEpic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, asserted Apple's commissions for clicking on external payment links combined with other costs for payment processing effectively make the alternative more expensive than just paying Apple's fees for using its standard system.\n\nPrompted by Epic's objections, Gonzalez Rogers is now mulling whether to hold Apple in contempt of her order and taking more drastic actions aimed at giving consumers more payment choices in hopes of fostering competition that could lower prices.\n\nIn the five hearings held on the issue so far, Gonzalez Rogers has repeatedly sounded frustrated with Apple executives while occasionally asking questions suggesting she thinks the iPhone maker is mostly focusing on how to preserve its profit margins and corral most payments to its in-house system.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the judge was relatively measured during Schiller's testimony, she was more blunt last week when was of his subordinates, Carson Oliver, was on the witness stand and she asked whether he understood the intent of her order.\n\n“Did you understand the point was to increase competition?” Gonzalez Rogers said. After Oliver confirmed he did, the judge muttered, “Doesn't seem like it.”\n\nDuring his Wednesday testimony, Schiller repeatedly defended Apple's response to the judge's order as well-intentioned to allow more competition while protecting the privacy and security of users.\n\nBut he had trouble explaining why the company is receiving so few applications to allow external payment links.\n\nIn the first four months, only 38 apps have sought approval for external payment links, and only 17 of those currently engaged in digital transactions, according to evidence submitted in the hearings. That is out of about 136,000 apps in the U.S. that have completed digital transactions in the U.S.\n\nSchiller said the facts emerging in the hearings — all of which he has attended — have prompted him to create “an action item” to prod more iPhone apps to take advantage of external payment options.\n\nThe hearings are scheduled to resume May 31. Schiller will return to the witness stand to continue his testimony.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Chip Stocks to Buy to Invest in AI’s Brain",
        "content": "Shares in global chipmakers have continued to move higher presenting some compelling chip stocks to buy. This is amid a more favorable macro backdrop and unprecedented demand for high-end chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) apps. The investment appeal of these stocks received a notable boost after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chip manufacturing company, reported April revenue up nearly 60% from the same period last year.\n\nThis marks the most substantial growth rate for the year 2024 thus far. TSMC is a crucial supplier for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). It has a strong performance signaling anticipated growth in customer operations.\n\nChip stocks maintain a favorable outlook on the risk-reward potential for global semiconductor stocks. Here, we look at three chip stocks to buy that are considered safe bets in the chipmaking sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading global technology company and one of the top chip stocks to buy. The company designs, develops and supplies various semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Broadcom’s offerings encompass data center networking, broadband access, software, and wireless connectivity.\n\nMost recently, Barclays initiated coverage on Broadcom with a positive outlook, assigning an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,405. The brokerage firm highlighted that Broadcom is leading in the data center silicon market and poised to benefit from the burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBroadcom’s inclusion in Barclays’ list of preferred names for the year stems from its robust data center silicon portfolio. Despite the semiconductor industry’s susceptibility to cyclical downturns, the company’s growing software business is recognized as a pivotal element in bolstering profitability and free cash flow.\n\nBarclays’ attention to AI’s potential is timely. The firm anticipates a mid to high-20% growth rate for Broadcom next year. This surge will continue over the long haul, fueled by the company’s expertise in custom silicon and switching solutions.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a leading global innovative memory and storage solutions provider. Micron’s product portfolio includes DRAM, NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory, integral to advanced computing, mobile applications and data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s stock has surged on robust demand for high bandwidth memory this year. Micron is the supplier of these chips, alongside Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix’s (OTC:HXSCL). Along these lines, Baird analysts recently upgraded their rating on Micron stock.\n\nThe brokerage firm cited significant growth opportunities for the company in the face of increasing demand for AI applications. The firm changed its rating from Neutral to Outperform. It’s anticipating substantial upside potential for the United States’ largest memory chip manufacturer.\n\nThe upgrade comes after Baird analysts researched the semiconductor industry, identifying positive trends in the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) market that could benefit Micron. According to Baird, recent checks within the channel have revealed an outlook for memory that could be favorable over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nAdditionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has recognized the strong performance and market position of Micron. It has upgraded its rating from “Underweight” to “Equalweight” and substantially increased its price target from $98 to $130 — an increase of over 32%.\n\nBaird’s report highlighted that DRAM prices surpass expectations, which could lead to constrained industry-wide supply growth. They expect the growth to slow to low single digits quarter-over-quarter in the latter half of 2024.\n\nThis slowdown is partly due to capacity shifts toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM). It is expected to enter a new supercycle that could significantly enhance Micron’s gross margins. The investment firm pointed out Micron’s production of HBM3E, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. It has the potential to achieve over 60% gross margin.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website.

(NASDAQ:SMCI), known as Supermicro, is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server technology and innovation. The company provides advanced server solutions, storage systems, and cloud computing technologies.\n\nWall Street analysts recently highlighted SMCI as one of the top chip stocks to buy, describing the stock as the “Switzerland of AI” following the company’s announcement of another set of strong quarterly results. Rosenblatt analysts, known for their expertise on chip stocks, pointed out that the company’s AI dynamics are “a sweet spot for the company’s building block architecture, Green computing, rapid broad platform deployment, and must-have liquid cooling capabilities.“\n\nSimilarly, analysts at Loop Capital reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Super Micro Computer, maintaining a price target of $1,500. The firm anchors its positive stance on the stock in Super Micro’s well-positioned AI dynamics, driven by the company’s building block architecture.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Federal Circuit Overturns GM's Patent Win Against Auto-Parts Provider LKQ\n\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) has experienced a setback in its legal battle against aftermarket auto parts provider LKQ Corp. (NASDAQ:LKQ) regarding fender designs.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned a previous decision favoring GM, marking a huge shift in design-patent law with a rare full-court decision.\n\nReuters reported that the Federal Circuit Court discarded a long-standing test for determining the validity of a design patent and remanded the case to the U.S. Patent Office for further review.\n\nMeanwhile, LKQ’s attorney, Mark Lemley, described the ruling as vital to providing consumers with safer, quality repair options.\n\nDesign patents safeguard the unique visual features of manufactured items. In 2022, LKQ requested the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board to invalidate a GM design patent for a front vehicle fender after their licensing agreement lapsed, and GM threatened legal action.\n\nAlso Read: General Motors, LG Establish $150M Settlement Fund For Bolt EV Battery Issues: Report\n\nLKQ contended that GM’s patent was obvious by comparing it to two earlier designs, but the board ruled in GM’s favor. A three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit later upheld this decision.\n\nThe full Federal Circuit agreed last June to revisit the case, marking its first full-court rehearing in a patent case since 2018.\n\nLKQ argued that the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision, which rejected rigid and mandatory formulas for utility patents, should apply to design patents as well.\n\nSeveral auto parts companies supported LKQ, claiming that maintaining the current test would increase the cost and reduce the availability of replacement parts.\n\nConversely, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) advocated for retaining the existing test to ensure a predictable patent landscape.\n\nThe Federal Circuit sided with LKQ, deeming the current test as improperly rigid and suggesting a more flexible approach akin to the utility-patent obviousness test.\n\nPrice Action: At the last check on Wednesday, GM shares were trading lower by 1.54% at $44.24.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nGENERAL MOTORS (GM): Free Stock Analysis Report LKQ (LKQ): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Federal Circuit Overturns GM's Patent Win Against Auto-Parts Provider LKQ originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Everything looks expensive right now.\n\nFrom groceries to travel and fuel, we’ve seen massive price hikes across all industries. And unless inflation cools, we must deal with it. However, investors can make the most of the impact of inflation on the stocks. Several stocks have seen a drop in value despite reporting impressive quarterly results.\n\nSo, could this be your chance to pounce? A few inexpensive high-potential stocks can deliver jaw-dropping returns, and they have already reported strong fundamentals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach stock trades below $200 and present as a long-term buy and hold. As some of the best companies in their respective industries, these stocks have the strength to survive the market turmoil and rise higher. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeaten-down Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock is trading at $143 today and has lost 8% value in the past month. The company has been under pressure after the first-quarter results since investors weren’t happy with the guidance.\n\nAirbnb had the best Q1 ever with 133 million nights and experiences booked. It reported an 18% year-over-year (YOY) jump in revenue to hit $2.1 billion. The net income came in at $264 million, which is also its most profitable first quarter.\n\nHowever, the market only paid attention to the guideline for the second quarter which shadowed the impressive numbers. The management is aiming for a 9% revenue growth in Q2 to hit $2.7 billion, lower than the growth achieved in the first quarter and below estimates. Since Airbnb operates an asset-light model, it has the potential to gain financial strength with each profitable quarter.\n\nI believe Airbnb is a solid long-term play and am impressed at the company’s bounce-back post pandemic. The summer travel could lead to better-than-expected results for the company.\n\nABNB gives strong competition to hotels and is using technology to enhance user experience. I think the market reaction is overdone, and the recent dip in the stock is a chance to accumulate.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a poor start to 2024, and its price has only started to recover slowly. The company reported a drop in iPhone sales due to the economic downturn and also announced a massive buyback. Investors aren’t very convinced about the future of Apple. But I believe this is one company that can bounce back at any time.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp 3% year-to-date (YTD), AAPL exchanges hands for $192 and is moving closer to the 52-week high of $199. If you can keep the drop in iPhone sales aside, Apple looks like a highly lucrative business with a powerful brand name. Its service segment is thriving and has outperformed other segments. In the recent quarter, it reported a 14% YOY revenue jump.\n\nMoreover, Apple enjoys high brand loyalty and this has helped it expand across the world. Someone using an Apple product today might not easily switch to another brand. Yes, one cannot ignore the China problem, but I think Apple has the potential to handle this situation well.\n\nAlso, it has enough resources to keep innovating and offering the most technologically advanced products to consumers. Apple has announced the largest share repurchase in history and this move has worked in its favor. Additionally, it declared a 25-cent dividend for shareholders. Looking at the company’s growth story, the stock looks inexpensive at the current level and is a buy-and-hold.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is exchanging hands for $183 today and is up 23% YTD. The stock has seen a steady rise over the past 12 months, and it is not long before it hits $200.\n\nThe company reported a blowout quarter driven by the cloud segment and advertising revenue. With two of its fastest-growing segments, Amazon has become so much more than an e-commerce company.\n\nIt saw a 13% jump in sales to $143.3 billion. The cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed a 17% YOY revenue growth while the advertising segment was up 24% YOY. Notably, the net income reached $10.4 billion as compared to the net income of $3.2 billion in the same period the prior year.\n\nFurther, Amazon has a highly diversified business with multiple revenue sources which will continue driving growth. It started investing in artificial intelligence (AI) well in time to gain a higher market share with AWS. Thus, its investments have started to pay off. Finally, it also has enough cash flow to keep investing in the business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI is making Microsoft vs. Apple interesting again",
        "content": "For the first time in a long time, the battle between Macs and PCs is interesting again.\n\nApple's (AAPL) products have been beating out Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows-based PCs for years thanks to their superior battery life and performance. But Microsoft says it’s finally tipped the scales back in its own favor.\n\n“We have more powerful silicon. We've rewritten [Windows 11] to take advantage of it. And then we have unique experiences we've built on top of that platform,” Microsoft consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance. “So I think we have a distinct advantage for a period of time here.”\n\nMicrosoft says it’s achieved this through a new category of AI PCs it’s calling Copilot+ PCs.\n\nYou’ve probably already heard about AI PCs, which are PCs that include special neural processing units (NPUs) that can run AI apps locally rather than relying on cloud-based services like ChatGPT.\n\nCopilot+ PCs include those same NPUs, but also come with a minimum of 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and, importantly, run Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant for Windows 11.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot+ PCs come as the PC industry hopes it’s entering a period of sustained sales growth after two years of steep declines. According to IDC, PC sales grew 1.5% in the first quarter compared to a drop of 28.7% in Q1 last year.\n\n“There's no doubt in my mind that the demand is here,” Mehdi said. “And this is going to spur a purchase of PCs in ways that we haven't had before.”\n\nFor the first time in decades, Mehdi added, Microsoft feels it has an edge on Apple from both a performance standpoint and because it offers “completely unique things that you can’t do anywhere else.”\n\nWindows gets GPT-4o\n\nApple is notoriously behind Microsoft in the AI race, having sat on the sidelines until very recently — though it has made sure that its hardware has extremely fast AI-ready chips.\n\nLooking to take advantage of Apple being caught on the back foot, Microsoft hopes the Copilot+, which is powered by GPT-4o, will provide a seismic productivity boost with the ability to serve as a user's go-to assistant for tasks ranging from dealing with common problems like audio issues to summarizing documents. Microsoft senior product manager Oyin Shenbanjo speaks about the new Surface Laptop in comparison to the MacBook Air M3 during the Microsoft Briefing event at the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, Wash., on May 20, 2024. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft also introduced its new Copilot Recall, a feature that makes it easier to search virtually everything you’ve done on your PC, including documents, photos, and web pages. So, if you were planning a trip to Seattle but lost the site you were using to look up things to do, you can type “Seattle” into Recall, which will pull up the site you were browsing.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft says it does this by taking a snapshot of your screen over time and then using Copilot’s visual search feature to find the content you’re looking for. The company also says content saved in Recall is only stored on your device and that you can customize which apps use the feature.\n\nMicrosoft’s first Copilot+ PCs will hit the market in June starting at $999, conspicuously the same price as Apple’s MacBook Air.\n\nPerformance and battery life\n\nWindows and Mac users may have different priorities, with many of them engrained in a specific ecosystem and unlikely to change. That is, unless perhaps fresh and exclusive AI functionality lures somebody over the fence. But they can still be put head to head.\n\nPerformance benchmarks have become major talking points, and Apple’s Mac laptops have been crushing Windows-based PCs in terms of power efficiency ever since the iPhone maker rolled out its first M1 chip for MacBooks in 2020.\n\nThose Arm-based (ARM) chips have made it so MacBooks can last all day on a single charge while providing exceptional overall performance across a multitude of use cases. But Microsoft says its Windows PCs have a new weapon that puts it back in a leadership position: Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Pro chips.\n\nDuring its announcement on Monday, the company said a Copilot+ PC running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chip gets 20% more battery life, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance than Apple’s MacBook Air with an M3 chip.\n\nWhat’s more, Mehdi said Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs beat out Apple’s latest M4 chip in terms of trillions of operations per second, or TOPs, a common measurement for gauging potential AI app performance.\n\nFor now, Microsoft has the edge thanks to an actual AI product. But Apple isn’t taking any of this lying down. The company will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, where it’s expected to roll out its own AI apps and services, including some that Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says will run on OpenAI’s AI software.\n\nAnd as far as its MacBooks go, Apple is still likely to announce its M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, which should offer better performance than its M4 and could outpace Qualcomm’s chips.\n\nMark June 10 on your calendar.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A surprisingly strong earnings season for big tech reaches its grand finale Wednesday afternoon when Nvidia Corp., the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant, reports its results and gives a much anticipated outlook that could set the tone for the second half of the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Flight Routes Suffer the World’s Worst Turbulence One Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence ‘It Felt Like We Had Crashed’: Singapore Air Passenger Describes Turbulence Terror Barclays Managers Warn Some Staff to Prepare for Five Days a Week in Office\n\nInvestors were nervous as technology companies started reporting, with questions about whether the AI boom had run too far and if the group could meet the lofty expectations set for it. A month later, most of those concerns have been put to rest with the S&P 500 Index sitting at an all-time high on the back of strong corporate profits.\n\nSo, Nvidia arrives with the expectation that it will confirm the enthusiasm — and potentially offer a glimpse into the future for stocks. The company’s shares have been on a rocket ride since its blow-out fiscal fourth-quarter results and outlook a year ago, soaring 212% and adding roughly $1.5 trillion in market value in the past 12 months. With a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion, Nvidia’s weighting in the S&P 500 is more than 5%, up from 2.2% a year ago.\n\nNvidia shares slipped about 1% in early trading on Wednesday, after closing at a record the day before.\n\n“It is the leader, and if the demand remains strong in Nvidia then you know that means demand is going to be strong across the board,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. “That will dictate not only the next leg in the AI-deemed stocks in the semiconductor space, but it could dictate the market.”\n\nThe AI Chip Behind Nvidia’s Supersonic Stock Rally: QuickTake\n\nMagnificent Seven Rides\n\nAn index that tracks seven of the biggest US technology stocks is at a record high after earnings from the likes of Microsoft Corp., Google-parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. showed that demand for AI services is helping to fuel revenue growth. Alphabet has rallied 13% since beating first-quarter sales estimates and initiating a dividend last month. And Apple Inc., whose shares had slumped as much as 14% this year, is close to turning positive for the year after its strong results.\n\n“The market has gotten a lot of what it’s wanted this earnings season,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of Ladenburg Asset Management and chief market strategist at its parent Osaic Holdings Inc. “Nvidia is sort of icing on the cake.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter four-consecutive quarters of Nvidia earnings that have blown past Wall Street estimates, investors have come to expect a repeat performance. What’s less certain is how the shares will respond. The stock has gained 0.1%, lost 2.5% and jumped 16% following the company’s last three reports. With an implied day-after-earnings move of about 8%, it’s a high stakes event for the entire market.\n\nNvidia shares tumbled 10% on April 19, their worst day since March 2020, as investors seemed to grow skeptical of the AI boom. But subsequent earnings reports from Alphabet, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. showed how much companies are planning to spend on computing infrastructure. That helped propel the stock to a record close on Tuesday.\n\n“The demand is still outstripping the supply,” said Mike Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management. “You can always have an overreaction to the upside and downside in the short term, but fundamentals for the business have not changed.”\n\nFading Enthusiasm\n\nStill, there are signs that the exuberance is starting to fade. In the options market, the premium for Nvidia calls over puts has disappeared in the past two months, an indication that investors are “hesitant to take long positions ahead of the report,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity trading strategy at Citigroup.\n\nTo that point, the debate is less about whether Nvidia will top expectations than about how much of a beat is needed for the stock to rally. To avoid a selloff, the company will have to top profit and sales estimates by at least 15%, said David Miller, senior portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds.\n\nIn its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia is projected to deliver earnings of $13.2 billion on sales of $24.7 billion, up 544% and 243%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nNvidia has beaten its revenue forecast by about $2 billion in each of the past two quarters, and Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore expect a similar performance this time. However, the rollout of a new chip dubbed Blackwell later this year has some investors concerned that customers could slow purchases of its predecessor until the new one is available.\n\n“For now our checks continue to point to strong, steady growth even as we transition to Blackwell,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nBeyond Blackwell, there’s also the normal cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, where sales booms can be followed by lulls as customers digest their inventory.\n\n“There’s going to be that day where we hit an air pocket,” said Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. “I don’t know if it’s this quarter, next quarter, next year or 10 years from now, but I know that these sales, you know, you tend to build ahead of things and then you pause.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple shares wavered in early trading on Wednesday, but are on track to notch their longest winning streak since 2022 if they’re able to recapture gains.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nBritish personal computer maker Raspberry Pi confirmed its plan for an initial public offering in London, marking a small step for the city that’s fallen behind a broader listings revival in Europe. Paytm warned of job cuts and said it would trim non-core assets after reporting its first sales decline on record, reflecting fallout from a regulatory probe that curtailed much of the Indian fintech pioneer’s business. Apple Inc. plans to ask a court to throw out the Justice Department’s antitrust case against the iPhone maker, making a long-shot bid to ward off what promises to be a lengthly legal battle. Snowflake Inc.’s talks to acquire startup Reka AI for more than $1 billion have broken down, dashing an effort by the software company to bring more generative AI muscle in-house. Sonos Inc. is entering the headphone market with a $449 device, part of an effort to turn the home-speaker company into a broader maker of consumer technology.\n\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna.\n\n(Updates stock moves at market open, adds Tech Chart of the Day)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "Here Are All 44 Stocks Warren Buffett Holds for Berkshire Hathaway's $378 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "In case you missed it, what's arguably the most important data release of the second quarter occurred last week -- and I'm not talking about the monthly inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nMay 15 marked the deadline for institutional money managers and wealthy investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F provides a portfolio snapshot that allows professional and everyday investors an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's most-admired investors have been buying, selling, and holding.\n\nTo be fair, 13Fs aren't perfect. These snapshots can be up to 45 days old when filed with the SEC. Nevertheless, 13Fs can alert investors to the stocks, industries, and trends that are piquing the interest of successful/billionaire money managers. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThere's not a 13F on Wall Street that's more anticipated each quarter than that of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). CEO Warren Buffett has delivered a greater than 5,000,000% aggregate return to his Class A shareholders (BRK.A) since taking the reins in the mid-1960s, and has practically doubled-up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over six decades.\n\nBased on Berkshire's 13F for the quarter ended in March, Warren Buffett and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are overseeing 44 stocks across the company's roughly $378 billion portfolio. Note, I've excluded the two index funds Berkshire Hathaway holds small stakes in -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- because index funds represent baskets of securities and aren't themselves stocks. I've also removed Paramount Global, which Buffett admitted to selling in its entirety during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting.\n\nWhat follows is a comprehensive breakdown of the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's core investments\n\nDespite putting $378 billion to work in 44 stocks, Warren Buffett and his team run a highly concentrated portfolio. This is to say that Buffett invests more of his company's capital in his top ideas. As of the closing bell on May 17, eight of Berkshire's holdings had a market value in excess of $10 billion, with these eight core holdings accounting for 82% of the company's $377.6 billion portfolio.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL): $149,766,876,019 in market value Bank of America(NYSE: BAC): $40,529,112,715 American Express(NYSE: AXP): $36,794,400,783 Coca-Cola: $25,244,000,000 Chevron(NYSE: CVX): $19,983,053,835 Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY): $15,687,146,596 Kraft Heinz: $11,719,597,100 Moody's: $10,138,291,967\n\nStory continues\n\nEven after selling more than 116 million shares of Apple during the first quarter, this tech giant still accounts for nearly 40% of Berkshire's invested assets.\n\nWhile Buffett has never been a tech-savvy investor, he understands consumer buying habits very well. Apple has a loyal customer base and has historically leaned on its physical product and subscription service innovation to drive its growth. It also doesn't hurt that Apple has repurchased a jaw-dropping $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began. Buybacks of this magnitude have helped increase Berkshire's ownership stake in Apple, as well as provided a boost to the company's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nYou'll note two other trends among the Oracle of Omaha's core investments: a heavy dose of financials and energy stocks.\n\nWith regard to the former, Buffett appreciates cyclical businesses that grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy. Bank of America, which is the most interest rate-sensitive large bank in the U.S., is able to expand its loan portfolio during long-winded periods of economic growth. Meanwhile, American Express benefits from playing both sides of the transaction aisle. It generates fees by processing transactions for merchants, and also acts as a lender, generating possible annual fees and interest income from its cardholders.\n\nAlthough energy stocks haven't historically comprised a sizable percentage of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, Buffett and his crew have absolutely piled into Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. These are integrated energy companies that generate their juiciest margins from their upstream drilling segments. If the spot price of crude oil remains elevated due to constrained global supply, Chevron and Occidental should bring in plenty of operating cash flow. Just keep in mind that while Chevron has one of the most flexible balance sheets among energy majors, Occidental Petroleum is still digging itself out of a sizable debt-driven hole. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe other billion-dollar wagers at Berkshire Hathaway\n\nEven with a jaw-dropping percentage of Berkshire's portfolio put to work in the eight core companies listed above, there are still 20 additional stocks Buffett and his team are invested in that have a market value ranging between $1 billion and $8 billion.\n\nMitsubishi: $7,766,903,245 Chubb: $7,126,722,854 Mitsui: $6,400,541,253 Itochu: $5,515,170,124 DaVita: $5,043,273,040 Citigroup: $3,553,897,791 Marubeni: $2,710,573,632 Kroger: $2,703,500,000 Sumitomo: $2,672,029,041 BYD: $2,514,497,175 Visa(NYSE: V): $2,325,861,013 VeriSign: $2,184,421,236 Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): $1,848,100,000 Mastercard(NYSE: MA): $1,834,575,677 Capital One Financial: $1,766,147,269 Liberty SiriusXM Series C: $1,713,670,919 Nu Holdings: $1,247,933,834 Aon: $1,194,945,000 Ally Financial: $1,247,933,834 Charter Communications: $1,049,933,912\n\nThese \"other\" billion-dollar bets are comprised of a heavy-dose of financial stocks (Warren Buffett's favorite sector), some of the Oracle of Omaha's \"indefinite\" holdings, and a sprinkling of ideas from Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.\n\nThe Oracle's love of financials is on full display with market share-leading payment processors Visa and Mastercard accounting for more than $4.1 billion of invested assets. In 2022, Visa and Mastercard combined for approximately 69% of credit card network purchase volume in the United States. Both companies have exceptionally long runways with which to organically or acquisitively expand their payment infrastructure into chronically underbanked emerging markets.\n\nThis billion-dollar bet section also contains Berkshire's notable investments in Japan's five largest trading houses (Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni, and Sumitomo). These are highly diverse companies that have their hands in multiple sectors and industries within Japan's economy. In Buffett's latest annual letter to shareholders, he described these trading houses as \"indefinite\" holdings for his company.\n\nLastly, this is the section where we begin to really see the influence of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler take shape. For example, e-commerce company Amazon isn't a stock that Warren Buffett purchased. Though the Oracle of Omaha appreciates Amazon and, in hindsight, regrets not buying it sooner, the company's primary cash flow drivers, such as cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), are beyond his typical scope of research and/or interest. AWS is currently pacing more than $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue.\n\nWarren Buffett's smaller holdings\n\nThe final section of Berkshire's approximately $378 billion portfolio is comprised of 16 smaller holdings that range in value from a low of $8.7 million to about $995 million.\n\nSnowflake: $994,883,570 Liberty SiriusXM Series A: $861,964,366 T-Mobile: $859,111,380 Louisiana-Pacific: $589,460,585 Floor & Décor: $567,290,400 Liberty Formula One Series C: $555,939,247 Liberty Live Series C: $442,297,801 Liberty Live Series A: $193,488,459 Sirius XM Holdings: $111,146,193 NVR(NYSE: NVR): $85,437,168 Diageo: $32,456,653 Lennar Class B(NYSE: LEN.B): $23,375,556 Liberty Latin America Series A: $22,993,122 Jefferies Financial Group: $20,377,226 Liberty Latin America Series C: $11,235,175 Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C: $8,733,337\n\nThese smaller holdings are traditionally where we see Combs and Weschler exercise their influence. As you can see from these 16 companies listed above, there's a focus on finding value in a generally pricey stock market.\n\nFor instance, Berkshire Hathaway's brightest minds began making investments in homebuilders during the second quarter of 2023. Although the largest position, which was a stake in D.R. Horton, has been sold, Combs and Weschler are still overseeing close to $109 million in invested assets between NVR and Lennar.\n\nShares of industry-leading homebuilder Lennar can be had for about 10 times forward-year earnings at a time when the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio is historically high. Meanwhile, NVR (the parent of Ryan Homes) has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than its peers, but also operates a land-light model that relies on lot purchase agreements (LPAs). Instead of buying and developing land like its peers, its puts down a small, nonrefundable deposit via LPAs that doesn't tie up much of its capital. This has allowed NVR to grow at a considerably faster pace than its peers.\n\nWhile it's always possible for one of these smaller holdings to eventually become a core holding at Berkshire Hathaway, these sub-$1-billion-dollar stakes are better viewed as shorter-term investments (one-to-five years).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings, Fed minutes, UK inflation - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Earnings from tech giant Nvidia are in the spotlight Wednesday, as investors look to see whether the stock's elevated valuation can be justified The minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting also loom large, while U.K. inflation fell by less than was expected in April.\n\n1. Nvidia earnings in spotlight\n\nThe day’s highlight is the long-awaited earnings report from semiconductor bellwether Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the close Wednesday, with these numbers widely seen as a barometer for the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry.\n\nInvestor enthusiasm over all-things AI has helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climb close to its all-time high, up more than 12% this year.\n\nNvidia’s earnings are likely to impact the share prices of AI-related companies - such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) - but will also have an outsized influence over broader markets given it is now the third-biggest U.S. company by market value, trailing only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nRobust earnings from Nvidia could help justify stock market valuations that have grown stretched in recent months.\n\n“We expect NVIDIA to beat and raise in the April quarter, albeit not reaching the levels of the January quarter, due to improved supply and anticipated year-over-year deceleration from tougher comparisons,” said analysts at Rosenblatt, in a note dated May 20.\n\n“We expect volatility into this week’s print but are nonetheless positively biased on a story that is increasingly resonating with the best secular idea in all of technology.”\n\n2. Fed minutes to offer interest rate clues\n\nMinutes from the Federal Open Markets Committee's most recent meeting are due to be released later in the session, and they will be parsed for clues regarding timing and extent of policy-easing this year.\n\nLast week’s cooler-than-expected U.S. CPI release has calmed nerves about the Federal Reserve keeping rates higher for longer, but this release followed the Fed meeting that these minutes represent.\n\nFed officials have continued to warn about inflation risks, creating a degree of uncertainty over when the Fed will start cutting this year, if at all.\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller on Tuesday said recent economic data indicates the Fed's restrictive policy is working as directed, while Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic said the central bank needs to exercise caution ahead of its first rate cut to lead to pent-up spending and send inflation \"bouncing around.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Futures little changed ahead of Fed minutes\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely unchanged Wednesday, amid caution ahead of the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting as well as results from market favorite Nvidia.\n\nBy 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 13 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 2 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 6 points, or 0.1%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices close higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite registering new record-setting closes.\n\nIn the corporate sector, Nvidia’s numbers will be the highlight, and earnings are also due from the likes of Target (NYSE:TGT), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), TJX (NYSE:TJX) and Raymond James (NYSE:RJF).\n\nElsewhere, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) stock rose over 6% after the clothing retailer beat expectations on the top and bottom line in its latest quarter, while homebuilder Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) gained 1% after raising its full-year delivery guidance.\n\n4. UK inflation falls by less than expected\n\nInflation in Britain fell by less than expected in April, disappointing investors who were looking for the Bank of England to cut interest rates next month and suggesting that global inflationary pressures may prove tricky to tame.\n\nConsumer prices rose by an annual 2.3%, down sharply from a 3.2% increase in March and its lowest since July 2021 when it stood at 2.0%, the Office for National Statistics said. But still above the 2.1% forecast.\n\nServices inflation - a key gauge of domestically generated price pressure for the BoE - was much higher than expected, at 5.9% from 6.0% in March, above the expected reading of 5.5%.\n\nEconomists had widely expected a sharper drop in inflation, citing a 12% drop in regulated household energy tariffs that took effect last month.\n\nAfter Wednesday's inflation figures for April, there will be a set of official labor market data and May's inflation release before the BoE's next scheduled policy announcement on June 20.\n\nThe Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates this summer, but August is more favored as the start of the cutting cycle, rather than June.\n\n5. Crude fell after US inventories build\n\nCrude prices fell Wednesday, retreating for the third straight session on U.S. interest rates jitters as well as an unexpected build in U.S. inventories.\n\nBy 04:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $77.74 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.1% to $81.94 per barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly grew by 2.5 million barrels last week, raising some concerns over sluggish U.S. oil demand, with the upcoming Memorial Day holiday marking the traditional start of the travel-heavy summer season.\n\nOfficial inventory data from the Energy Information Agency are due later in the session.\n\nA string of cautious statements from Federal Reserve officials this week also weighed on sentiment, as markets feared that high-for-longer U.S. rates will eat into demand this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings, Fed minutes, UK inflation - what's moving markets\n\nStocks slip on inflation jitters, offsetting Nvidia hopes\n\nChina will control property sector risk, says vice premier\n\nView comments",

It’s also faced turnover in the top diversity job. The first executive in the role, human resources executive Denise Young Smith, was out after less than a year in 2017. She was replaced by Christie Smith, who left in 2020.\n\nThe job involves reporting to Apple’s chief people officer, Carol Surface, and working with groups within the company to support diversity. Apple also has a $200 million Racial Equity and Justice initiative that focuses on education, criminal justice reform and economic equality.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has made progress improving diversity in its workforce, though the share of underrepresented minorities hasn’t increased dramatically.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2022, the percentage of Black employees rose to about 9% from 7% in the US. The number of Asian employees doubled to 30%, while the share of Latino workers increased to 15% from 11%. Globally, women account for 35% of Apple’s workforce, up from 30% in 2014. The company hasn’t published new numbers on its website since 2022.\n\nAt the same time, the broader push for diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, has faced a backlash in corporate America. The proportion of US companies that fund a DEI function is set to drop to just 20% by the end of this year, compared with 33% in 2022, according to Forrester Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "Three stocks might be considered potential opportunities to purchase stocks at a discount. These companies are involved in various industries, which makes solid ideas for possible recoveries and substantial profits.\n\nThe first, a market leader in application software, revealed overall revenue with a noteworthy increase in its strategic portfolio year-over-year (YoY). One of its sectors saw significant growth due to strategic alliances and subscription growth.\n\nMeanwhile, with over $1 billion in cash on hand, the second one—a major participant in the healthcare technology industry—has the financial power to invest in cutting-edge technologies and overcome market obstacles. Due to its focused cost-saving measures, the company expects to save millions of dollars in 2024 and 2025.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, driven by proactive inventory management and supply chain improvements, the third company reported a considerable boost in its gross margin. It operates in the clothes, accessories, and luxury goods sectors. With almost $1 billion in cash and a recently announced $500 million share repurchase program, the firm exhibits sound financial standing and optimism about its future.\n\nUnity (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity’s (NYSE:U) first-quarter sales were $460 million, of which $426 million came from the strategic portfolio—a 2% YoY increase. Create Solutions’ sales in the strategic portfolio amounted to $133 million, indicating a robust YoY growth of 17%, propelled by subscriptions and strategic alliances. However, Grow Solutions’ revenue, part of the strategic portfolio, was $294 million, a 4% YoY decrease. To spur expansion in this market, Unity constantly aims to enhance the functionality of its monetization options.\n\nFurther, Unity’s EBITDA increased by $50 million YoY, indicating a notable improvement in profitability. This enhancement shows efficient operations and successful cost control. Like-for-like net income rose to about $100 million YoY, demonstrating Unity’s ability to enhance its financial position. Unity maintains strong client engagement and retention rates despite industry headwinds. Thus, positive customer feedback and retention show that Unity’s clientele is satisfied and loyal.\n\nLastly, Unity engages in mixed reality projects and has partnered with major companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META). Therefore, this suggests that it can take market share in developing markets and boost revenue in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nTeladoc (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith more than $1 billion in cash, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) has the financial flexibility to engage in growth projects. Teladoc stands out from rivals because of its solid financial standing, which enables it to make smart investments and successfully handle market difficulties. Moreover, the company has a target of $43 million in GAAP cost reductions for 2024 and a total of $85 million by 2025. Hence, these reductions are derived from several productivity and cost-cutting measures.\n\nAdditionally, compared to Q1 of 2023, when there was a net outflow of $32 million, Teladoc’s first-quarter free cash flow showed a net outflow of $27 million. Despite being a normally low cash flow quarter because of yearly incentive compensation payments, this increase in cash flow management shows improved operational efficiency and financial discipline.\n\nFinally, Teladoc has had success cross-selling more services by utilizing the size of its installed base. Cross-selling to the current clientele accounted for two-thirds of bookings in Q1, while the remaining one-third came from new customers. Hence, adding new services improves customer retention while optimizing income from current members.\n\nUnder Armour (UAA) under armour stock\n\nSource: 2p2play / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn Q4 of fiscal 2024, Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) increased its gross margin by 1.7% to 45%. The gross margin grew to 46.1% for 2024, a 1.3% boost. Decreased product and freight costs resulting from supply chain improvements partly contributed to the increase in gross margin. Nevertheless, negative foreign exchange effects and a rise in direct-to-consumer marketing efforts somewhat countered this.\n\nMoreover, adjusted SG&A expenditures in Q4, excluding particular costs such as litigation reserve fees, decreased by 5% to $546 million and by 2% to $2.3 billion for 2024. The decrease in costs suggests that the bottom line may improve shortly. By the end of Q4, inventory had dropped by 19% to $958 million. Hence, this demonstrates the company’s proactive approach to inventory management.\n\nLastly, with $859 million in cash at the end of Q4, Under Armour had no outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility. The corporation expressed confidence in its current situation and prospects by announcing a fresh $500 million share repurchase program.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "U.S. equities appear to be back on the rise in May. After suffering significant losses in the month of April, both the S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have more than recovered. In fact, the Nasdaq has risen 11.24% as of the end of Friday’s trading session. Leading the rise of U.S.-listed stocks has largely been technology companies. Everything from the rise of cloud computing to advanced generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have boosted share prices.\n\nTech giants, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google have become trillion-dollar companies in terms of their stock market capitalization. Over the next decade, several mega-cap tech stocks are well on their way to reaching $1 trillion. Below are three of them.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which boasts an $84 billion market cap, has become a dominant force within the cloud-based cybersecurity space. Embedding artificial intelligence technology into its vulnerability management (VM) tools has only increased the value of its products. CrowdStrike’s Falcon end-point security platform had its debut way back in 2013 and always employed machine learning techniques to identify threats across an enterprise’s technology apparatus. The release of advanced AI models has allowed the platform to be a one-stop solution for end-point security.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCloud-based cybersecurity has increased in demand over the past decade. The rise of cloud computing technology placed tons of enterprise data and applications on cloud servers. In a multitude of manners, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated demand for cloud products, as many businesses went remote and adopted online tools powered by cloud technology. With companies storing much of their data in distant servers versus on their own premises, cybersecurity has become increasingly important.\n\nNot to mention, the cybersecurity space is succumbing to increased consolidation. A lot of these smaller cybersecurity players have lost out to other larger players, including CrowdStrike. For evidence, one just needs to observe the robust double-digit growth rates of CrowdStrike’s sales figures versus the plummeting rates of similar VM platforms like Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), or Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS).\n\nCrowdStrike shares have risen 35.5% on a year-to-date-basis and could very well continue their rise as the platform dominates its respective space.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a key semiconductor computer processor giant. Consumer technology enthusiasts know AMD for their competitively priced and quality central porcessing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The chipmaker was able knock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) off its feet due to adopting a fabless model of producing silicon chips. That is, rather than being bogged down on the manufacturing side of chipmaking like Intel, AMD outsourced that to the very capable Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). It effectively allows it to focus on chip design and efficiency.\n\nAMD next momentous rise will be in the space of AI chips. The semiconductor firm announced an array of new GPUs that would empower the creation of large language models (LLMs) in June 2023 and followed that up with subsequent releases in December. Of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI chip space currently but as AMD enters the market and acquires market share, not only will AMD increase sales and net income growth, but its market capitalization could skyrocket.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing makes the final entry on this list. This Taiwan-based contract chip manufacturer has a market capitalization of $672 billion and is poised to rise even further. The chip manufacturer dominates in terms of manufacturing capabilities and capacity. To make silicon chips more efficient from generation to generation, it’s always been about fitting more transistors on a smaller node size. TSM has been able to successfully manufacture chips at a 3-nanometer node size. It is the most advanced in the industry at this point.\n\nBecause of TSM’s prowess, companies like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD have leveraged its capabilities to construct their advanced chips. What will make TSM a $1 trillion company is the demand for AI chips. In their first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, TSM handily beat both revenue and earnings estimates. The reason was the sizable demand for advanced AI chips that has been all the craze over the past 12 months.\n\nRiding off of this demand and its successful manufacturing competencies, TSM is probably the most likely on this list to become the next Apple, Amazon or Google in terms of market cap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

Spotify: iPhone Maker Fights $1.95B EU Fine Over App Store Practices\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is contesting a $1.95 billion (1.8 billion euros) fine imposed by the European Union, which accuses the tech giant of undermining fair competition from music-streaming services like Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT).\n\nThe company has filed an appeal with the EU's General Court in Luxembourg to overturn the decision made in March, according to a report from Bloomberg.\n\nThe EU's action against Apple also includes a mandate to stop preventing music-streaming apps from informing users about cheaper deals outside of its App Store.\n\nSpotify has been changing its app, such as displaying pricing information in-app for EU users, to comply with the European Commission's antitrust ruling against Apple.\n\nThe investigation began following a complaint from Spotify, which claimed that Apple's control over the App Store forced it to raise subscription prices to cover additional costs.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, has stated it is prepared to defend its decision in court.\n\nRelated Read: TikTok Parent ByteDance Overtakes Baidu In AI Chatbot Race In China: Report\n\nHowever, Apple pointed to an earlier blog post that argued that EU regulators did not find any credible evidence of consumer harm.\n\nThis latest appeal is part of a series of legal battles between Apple and EU regulators.

Neals, Apple said \"far from being a monopolist, Apple faces fierce competition from well-established rivals, and the complaint fails to allege that Apple has the ability to charge supra-competitive prices or restrict output in the alleged\n\nsmartphone markets.\"\n\nApple said the complaint should be dismissed on a number of grounds.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. plans to ask a court to throw out the Justice Department’s antitrust case against the iPhone maker, making a long-shot bid to ward off what promises to be a lengthly legal battle.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence ASML, TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Tesla Shareholder Group Slams Elon Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Package Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’\n\nLawyers representing the company sent a letter to the judge overseeing the case in New Jersey outlining the arguments it will include when it files a formal motion to dismiss the lawsuit next month. The company said in the letter that the government’s complaint doesn’t allege anticompetitive conduct, substantial anticompetitive effects or monopoly power in a relevant market.\n\n“This court should reject the invitation to forge a new theory of antitrust liability that no court has recognized, that would harm innovation, and that would only deprive consumers of the key competitive features that make iPhone distinctive,” Apple wrote in its filing.\n\nThe US government is due to respond to Apple’s letter by May 30, while the court’s ruling on the formal motion to dismiss is due either later in 2024 or early next year. If the case ultimately goes to trial, proceedings likely wouldn’t occur for at least a few years.\n\nRead More: Justice Department Risks Picking the Wrong Fight With Apple\n\nMotions to dismiss are commonly filed in antitrust cases, though rarely granted in government lawsuits. Alphabet Inc.’s Google filed one in the Justice Department case concerning its advertising technology business, but failed to get the case tossed out.\n\nBy contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. successfully persuaded a federal judge to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission complaint by arguing that the agency didn’t provide enough evidence that the company had a monopoly in social networking. The FTC subsequently filed an amended complaint that the judge allowed to move forward.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Apple in March, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals and app developers from accessing key hardware and software features. The complaint marked the conclusion of a half-decade probe into Apple and followed moves by other regions, including the European Union, to rein in Apple’s power.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Apple has used its control over app distribution to thwart innovation and make it harder for consumers to switch phones. The company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This case is about freeing smartphone markets from Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct and restoring competition to lower smartphone prices for consumers, reducing fees for developers, and preserving innovation for the future,” according to the suit, which seeks changes to Apple’s practices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of ‘Trump Forever’ Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "title": "The 2034 Millionaire’s Club: 3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Metaverse stocks to buy have emerged as compelling investment opportunities. Despite the controversy surrounding them, these companies are at the forefront of redefining how we interact with the internet and shaping the future of online experiences. From cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to virtual concert tickets and immersive gaming experiences, the metaverse is becoming an increasingly integral part of our lives.\n\nInvestors looking to capitalize on the growth potential of the metaverse should consider adding these stocks to their portfolios. Currently, many metaverse stocks are trading at a discount, with some big names in the industry trading below their intrinsic values. This presents a unique opportunity for savvy investors to accumulate shares at attractive prices before the market fully recognizes the potential of these companies.\n\nSo, with that said, here are three metaverse stocks to buy now that could create new millionaires by 2034.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe popular online platform Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) is where users create and interact in virtual worlds, making it a key player in the metaverse ecosystem.\n\nRoblox reported a significant increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, rising to $749.9 million, a 30% increase compared to the previous year. The company’s bookings also saw a notable rise, reaching $1,126.8 million, marking a 25% year-over-year increase. Despite these gains, Roblox recorded a net loss of $323.7 million for the quarter​.\n\nRoblox has also outlined an ambitious roadmap to enhance its platform and creator tools. Key updates include improvements to virtual reality with Immersion Mode, enhanced haptics controls across supported platforms, and significant upgrades to the Avatar Creation and Marketplace systems.\n\nWith a market cap of just 21 billion, I feel that RBLX offers a great blend of a strong upside while being well-capitalized. Hence, its prospects for capital appreciation are substantial.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops advanced chips and technologies for 5G and XR platforms, crucial for the connectivity and performance needs of the metaverse.\n\n2023 Qualcomm experienced robust financial performance, especially evident in its Q4 results with a revenue of $11.4 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. Strong sales in their chipset division underpinned this performance due to increased demand from key partners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung. The full year results were equally impressive, with a revenue increase of 32% to $44.2 billion and net income jumping 43% to $12.9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2024, Qualcomm is focusing on expanding its influence in various tech sectors. It has outlined strategic targets, including major growth in its automotive revenues, which are expected to reach around $3.5 billion within five years.\n\nQCOM has rocketed over the past five years, gaining 198.69%. I believe that this huge outperformance compared to the broader indices will continue, making it one of those metaverse stocks to buy and one that could potentially mint new millionaires.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) specializes in haptic technology, providing tactile feedback systems that enhance the user experience in virtual and augmented reality environments within the metaverse.\n\nFor 2024, Immersion has already demonstrated a strong start with a notable first-quarter non-GAAP net income of $19.8 million, up from $9.5 million in the same period last year. This improvement signifies robust operational success and increased demand for its advanced haptic technologies.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, Immersion Corporation reported solid financial outcomes, particularly notable in its fourth-quarter performance with a significant rise in assets, from $190.11 million at the end of 2022 to $215.73 million by the end of 2023.\n\nIMMR’s market cap is also small at around $300 million when writing. It then has plenty of opportunity to offer serious capital appreciation to investors, and it has delivered gains of 22.69% over the past five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Don’t count Metaverse stocks to buy out just yet. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is shifting its focus on building out its artificial intelligence and metaverse technologies. Firms like HSBC are introducing a fund designed to seize opportunities in the metaverse for affluent clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nThis year, the global metaverse e-commerce market could grow 30% and reach a value of $30 billion this year. By 2025, the market could be worth $42 billion. By 2030, it could be worth more than $210 billion.\n\nThat being said, use weakness when choosing metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) gapped from about $40 to a low of $30 after cutting its annual bookings forecast. However, with the negativity now priced in, it’s starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $33.59, it’s also starting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R and could soon refill that bearish gap at around $40 again in the near term.\n\nRBLX is one of the top metaverse stocks to buy and hold long term.\n\nMoving forward, RBLX could easily push aggressively higher. For one, the company has about 16 million daily active users in the U.S. who spend about $150 annually. There are another 62 million outside of the U.S. who spend an average of about $24 a year.\n\nAlso, the company is opening a new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nIn addition, while we’ve seen multiple firms pile on with price downgrades, the pullback is overdone. The negativity has been priced in. And with the future potential growth of the metaverse, most notably metaverse e-commerce, RBLX is a steal at current prices.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeakness in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a buy opportunity.\n\nBut don’t wait too long to buy.\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $141 in earnings, it’s just starting to pivot higher again. Last trading at $166.33, I’d like to see AMD retest $180 again shortly. Helping, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just added AMD artificial intelligence chips to its cloud computing products.\n\nTwo, analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of AMD with a buy rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our views on NVDA and AMD haven’t changed, but the relative move in stock prices YTD causes us to make a tactical shift in priority, moving AMD to the Wolfe Alpha List, replacing NVDA, which is up ~90% YTD and ~100% since it was added to the list in November 2023,” added Wolfe.\n\nWe also must consider that companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) An image of a VR headset and headphones; the word metaverse on the headset. metaverse cryptos\n\nSource: PopTika/Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), it traded at around $12.41 on May 8. Still rebounding from its dip to $11.40, the METV ETF still offers a solid long-term opportunity on the metaverse.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U) and Microsoft to name a few of them.\n\nWith some of the top tech heavyweights on board, I’d buy the METV ETF at current prices and check back on it in a few months. From its last traded price of $12.55, I’d like to see it closer to $20, with its holdings in NVDA, AAPL and RBLX expected to explode higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Comcast (CMCSA) revealed the price of its recently announced StreamSaver bundle, which will package Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier (NFLX) and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nThe new offering, available to Comcast’s broadband internet and TV subscribers, will launch next week at a price point of $15 a month, yielding savings of around 35% compared to the cost of subscribing to the three services separately, Comcast said.\n\nCustomers can also access Netflix and Apple TV+ subscriptions through Comcast's Now TV streaming platform, which includes Peacock and 40 other channels, for $30 a month (as opposed to $20 a month without the additional services.)\n\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Streamers have found it difficult to retain subscribers over the longterm.\n\n\"One of the biggest issues the industry has faced is serial churners,\" Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley told Yahoo Finance. \"Even for the top platforms like Netflix, churn is still a very real problem. ... Bundling is a big effort to try to mitigate that.\"\n\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.\n\nDisney (DIS), which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.\n\nThe move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney announced a new streaming bundle that will combine Disney+, Hulu, and Max, with a launch date set for this summer in the US. In December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ).\n\nAnd earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. Last week, the companies announced its name: Venu.\n\nStory continues Comcast revealed the price of its recently announced StreamSaver bundle, which will package Peacock's ad-supported premium tier with Netflix's basic ad tier and Apple TV+.

        "content": "Riders can buy passes from the Île-de-France Mobilités iOS app or directly from Apple Wallet, and use an iPhone or Apple Watch to tap and ride. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nCustomers can add a Navigo card to Apple Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to ride the metro, train, bus, and more in the Paris region\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., May 21, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® and Île-de-France Mobilités today introduced an easy, secure, and private way for customers to add a new Navigo card to Apple Wallet® and purchase passes to ride transit in the Paris region. Riders can buy passes from the Île-de-France Mobilités iOS app or directly from Apple Wallet, and use an iPhone® or Apple Watch® to tap and ride. Additionally, beginning this week, real-time transit information in Apple Maps is available in Paris to help users navigate their travels throughout the city.\n\n\"In the lead-up to what will surely be an amazing summer for the Paris region, we’re thrilled to bring Navigo cards to Apple Wallet and provide Parisians and visitors with an incredibly convenient and secure way to ride transit in Paris and explore the city,\" said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \"Users will love the safety, security, and seamlessness of purchasing passes and riding with a Navigo card in Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch.\"\n\nAdd a New Navigo Card to Apple Wallet and Buy a Transit Pass\n\nStarting today, users can quickly and easily add a new Navigo card to Wallet by opening the Wallet app, tapping the Add (+) button, selecting \"Transit Card,\" and following the instructions.

Riders can purchase t+, t+ reduced price, OrlyBus, RoissyBus tickets, and Navigo Day passes in Apple Wallet by selecting their Navigo card of choice, tapping the More (…) button, and selecting \"Buy Passes.\"\n\nTap to Ride with Navigo Card in Apple Wallet\n\nNavigo cards in Apple Wallet allow for an easy and convenient commuting experience.

        "content": "If you’re looking to retire comfortably with a jumbo-sized nest egg, focus on businesses that raise the bar on themselves. In the age of generative artificial intelligence (AI), I’d look out for companies that adapt quickly to unlock substantial benefits.\n\nIndeed, AI stands to benefit more than just the tech firms investing billions into chatbots or large language models (LLMs). Also, enterprise users of such technologies will see some productivity gains and perhaps even cost savings.\n\nEither way, AI is one of those emerging technologies you can’t ignore. So, let’s examine three stocks that can adapt to the new age and perhaps help you achieve a fairly plush future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig-box retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) hasn’t only adapted to the digital age. It is starting to become an innovator in its own right. After the incredible quarterly print that sent WMT stock soaring over 7% in a single trading session, the big question is this. Just how much of a historical premium should investors be willing to pay?\n\nAt 27.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), WMT is definitely on the higher end for a retailer known for rock-bottom prices. Part of the premium can be attributed to Walmart is offering customers great deals at a time when it’s hard to stay within one’s weekly grocery budget. After all, it’s not hard to imagine that inflation is to thank for the recent sales surge.\n\nIn a recent conference call, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Doug McMillion stated the recent quarter was “not inflation-driven results.” And that his firm is poised to continue growing “whether the environment is inflationary or deflationary.”\n\nConsumers continue to regard Walmart as the cheapest place to shop, regardless of where prices are heading. As Walmart rolls back on prices, expect sales to swell even further, especially if rivals can’t keep up with price cuts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThose who ditched Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be kicking themselves right about now. The stock is now up more than 15% in the past month.\n\nWall Street’s narrative was that Apple was “falling behind” in the AI race. And, with a lack of a new hit product (it’s looking like the first version of Vision Pro won’t fit the bill), the firm was poised for sub-par growth.\n\nWith Apple’s upcoming WWDC24 event June 10-14, the degree of renewed investor enthusiasm is almost palpable.\n\nSure, a handful of big-tech firms have already had their chance to wow crowds with their latest generative AI powers.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, investors seem more than willing to give the Vision Pro maker the benefit of the doubt again. Consider the potential for OpenAI to share the stage at WWDC24. Only time will tell if OpenAI and Apple announce something substantial. If they do, AAPL stock may be looking at a new all-time high for the summer.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) is down almost 15% from its 52-week high and 19% from its 2021 all-time high. As well-managed as Home Depot is, it still hasn’t been able to fly clear of industry headwinds. After a turbulent recent quarter, the company noted that home improvement demand faces challenges. And, the firm has to deal with the uncertainty of consumer purchasing habits.\n\nIndeed, volatility has the potential to swing both ways. And in due time, Home Depot will find itself flying with the wind at its back again. Until then, the company faces lower expectations for future quarters, making it a potentially decent time to punch one’s long-term ticket.\n\nUntil the tides turn, Home Depot can unlock further efficiencies across operations with a helping hand from AI. Such efficiencies should help the firm make the most of the next cyclical upswing in home improvement projects. For now, the stock looks like a decent value post-Q1 at just 23.1 times trailing P/E.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

        "title": "Worldwide Takeover: 3 Stocks Poised for Global Domination",
        "content": "Consider buying these stocks if you want your portfolio to grow!\n\nThe global stock market is undergoing profound transformations right now, with the rapid globalization of traditional companies, as well as the decentralization of the world’s largest companies, with many rising out of Asia, as opposed to the 20th and 21st centuries, which saw a great increase in companies which arose in the West.\n\nToday, I have focused on three stocks that I think have great potential in both the domestic and international markets and offer great solutions to various global problems. Additionally, all these companies have great growth potential, making them great stocks poised for global dominance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three stocks that I think you should invest in:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a semiconductor manufacturer offering international access to chip fabrication and engineering services, being best known for manufacturing chips for industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). TSM is trading at $153+ with a market cap of ~$680 billion.\n\nRevenue estimates are stable, ranging from $19.74 to $20.01 billion for this quarter. Additionally, TSM regularly beats estimates, with EPS surprising investors by 4.50% last quarter. Revenue and earnings held still, with quarterly YoY revenue growth of 16.50%, and quarterly YoY earnings growth at 8.90%.\n\nThe semiconductor sector has a projected CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. However, factors such as market volatility, supply and demand shocks, and geopolitical tensions could cause this growth to stagnate. To mitigate these risks, TSM is diversifying its factories out of East Asia and into more stable countries, which is why this stock is a buy.\n\nCelsius (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) develops, processes, markets, distributes and sells functional energy drinks and liquid supplements in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and internationally.\n\nCELH stock has seen year-over-year (YoY) quarterly revenue growth of 36.80% with an overall revenue of 1.41 billion dollars. Like TSM stock, Celsius regularly beats estimates, and EPS surprised investors by 42.10% last quarter.

        "title": "Intel Stock is an AI Play You Can Skip Out On",
        "content": "Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may capitalize on the generative AI trend, but Intel stock has moved the other way so far this year. It’s uncertain if the chip maker will find success in producing AI-compatible chips for the PC market.\n\nAdd in other risks, and there may not be enough in play to counter the key issue that weighs on shares. With this, forget about any sort of “fear of missing out” with INTC. The big fear here is the fear of getting stuck holding the bag.\n\nIntel Stock: Bouncing Back But Still Trending Lower\n\nDuring March and April, INTC experienced a steady slide in price, from around $45 to around $30 per share. The general sell-off in AI stocks during this time of course played a role in this. However, his big decline was in large part due to some discouraging news out of the company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst, in early April, Intel admitted that its turnaround, which relies heavily on the company becoming a major chip foundry, will not really start to play out until later this decade.\n\nSecond, later in them month, Intel released its latest quarterly results. While beating on earnings, Intel’s revenue for the quarter fell short of consensus estimates.\n\nWorse yet, the company provided very underwhelming guidance for the current quarter. Focusing on this major negative, investors bid down Intel stock in response. Yes, since the April 25 earnings release, shares have bounced back, albeit slightly.\n\nInvestors have reacted positively to the latest news regarding Intel’s global buildout of its chip manufacturing capacity. However, while inching higher in the short-term, INTC remains on a long-term downward trajectory.\n\nIt may be able to hold at or near present price levels for now, but not for long.\n\nWhy the Dust has Not Necessarily Settled\n\nWith Intel stock finding support at $30 per share, it may seem as though it has finally bottomed out, and that a rebound will continue. After all, take a look at 2025 earnings forecasts.\n\nThe sell-side expects Intel’s earnings to nearly double next year, from $1.10 per share to $2.01 per share. This consensus forecast suggests that AI-PC growth will help mitigate the impact of the foundry buildout. However, these forecasts may overly aggressive.\n\nAs mentioned above, while Intel may be moving aggressively into the AI-PC chip market, Intel’s success in this market could fall short of expectations. Why? Competition, and not only competition from the likes of its more cutting edge direct competitors. As we pointed out in a prior article on Intel, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI-PC chips, designed in-house, could give competing chips a run for their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf underwhelming success in AI-PC chips is coupled with, say, further headwinds stemming from the U.S.-China trade war, it may prove difficult for 2025 results to meet expectations. In the event this scenario becomes more likely to play out, the market could do yet another downward revision to INTC’s valuation.\n\nThe Verdict: More Declines Remain Very Possible\n\nFollowing the sell-off, investors are no longer pricing-in the foundry catalyst so strongly, but the AI-PC chips catalyst remains well baked into the valuation. In the months ahead, this could change, driving Intel down back to its multi-year lows in the mid-$20s per share.\n\nAlongside downside risk in the short run, is the risk of subpar returns in the long-run. Given how long its going to take for Intel to possibly make a full exit out of its slump, shares could underperform peers in a big way over the next few years.\n\nWhether you bought in before its short-lived late 2023 hot run, or if you’ve “bought the dip” in recent months, we reiterate that there’s little need to maintain an Intel stock position right now.\n\nIntel earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market is expanding rapidly and is projected to develop at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030. So, it's no surprise that numerous tech companies have joined the industry in an effort to take a slice of a $200 billion pie.\n\nOne of the most attractive features of AI is its versatility. The generative technology has the potential to boost countless markets, from consumer products to cloud computing, the automotive industry, video games, productivity software, and more. The sector is only just getting started, with now an excellent time to consider dedicating a portion of your holdings to AI and profit from the market's long-term development.\n\nSo, here are two artificial intelligence stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has faced repeated hits to its business in recent years that have seen its share price tumble 43% since 2021. As a result, patience will be essential with the company's stock, but recent developments suggest it could deliver major gains over the long term.\n\nIntel was once the biggest name in the chip market, responsible for more than 80% of the central processing unit (CPU) market and the exclusive chip supplier to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac lineup. Increased competition has brought its CPU share down to 64%, while Apple has transitioned to using in-house designed processors.\n\nRecent headwinds have forced Intel to rethink its model, restructuring its business to prioritize manufacturing and AI. The company has adopted a foundry model, which will see it open manufacturing plants throughout the U.S. as it attempts to steal market share from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger spoke on May 16 about the factory the company is building outside of Columbus, Ohio, saying, \"I want our Columbus site here, Ohio One, to be the AI systems fab for the nation.\" Gelsinger's comments about the site come only a month after Intel unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator, a chip designed to compete directly with Nvidia's AI graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nIntel still has a mountain to climb before it begins seeing significant returns on its investment in AI, but recent earnings indicate it's moving in a promising direction. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, Intel's free cash flow increased by $2 billion, from a negative $14 billion to a negative $12 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Q1 2024 saw Intel's AI and data-center segment report operating income of $184 million, significantly improving on the negative $69 million it posted in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is no doubt a long-term hold, but with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29 compared to Nvidia's 37 and AMD's 47, it's also one of the best-valued AI chip stocks.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is slightly late to the AI party, with competitors like Microsoft and Amazon making more headway in the industry. However, recent developments suggest Apple has a bright future in the market.\n\nThe iPhone maker made Wall Street bullish earlier this month when it debuted its newest iPad Pro. The tablet is the first device to utilize Apple's M4 chip, its most powerful chip to date. The new processor expands the company's AI capabilities, with many experts believing this is just the start of Apple's venture into the lucrative industry. The company will host its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where it's expected to introduce a range of new AI tools.\n\nAdditionally, the iPad debut comes just weeks after a Bloomberg report revealed Apple will completely revamp its Mac lineup to prioritize AI-enabled features.\n\nApple's expansion into AI may be moving slower than some of its peers, but that isn't necessarily bad. The company isn't known for always being the first to new technology but instead has a reputation for taking existing technology, perfecting it with its own design language, and quickly rising to dominance in the market by utilizing its immense brand loyalty.\n\nThe tech giant has employed this strategy in tablets, headphones, smartphones, and smartwatches. Different companies led each of these markets before Apple landed on the scene and stole the whole show. As a result, I wouldn't bet against Apple going far in AI over the long term. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nLike Intel, Apple's stock potentially offers more value than its competitors. The company's forward P/E is significantly lower than that of Microsoft and Amazon, making Apple's shares a far better value. And with that, Apple's stock is a screaming buy and one you can hold for the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple slashes iPhone prices in China for the second time this year as local competition pressures its sales",
        "content": "Apple just launched another round of discounts in China, an out-of-character move for the company as it tries to maintain its position in the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nApple started a new round of discounts on Chinese e-commerce platforms like JD.com and Alibaba's Tmall on Monday, slashing prices of the newest iPhone 15 model by over 20%, according to state-run Global Times. Discounts reached as high as 2,300 yuan ($138) on Tmall, Reuters reports. The promotion runs until May 28.\n\nIt’s Apple’s second round of discounts this year. In January, Apple offered a 500 yuan ($69) discount on its official website in China over a three-day period just before the Lunar New Year. Third-party resellers have also offered discounts on the iPhone 15.\n\nAnalysts say that Apple's discounts are necessary to preserve the company's market position in the country\n\n\"Apple's second price cut in China this year is a strategic move to defend its share in the premium segment,\" says Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. He suggests that Apple is trading hardware revenue in the short-term for a long-term increase in \"service-related revenue.\"\n\nAnd Monday's discount might not be Apple's last in China. \"Apple is riding the value-seeking trend in China,” said Will Wong, senior research manager for the Client Devices Group at IDC Asia-Pacific. “Chinese consumers are well-informed about price discounts...so it’ll be hard for Apple not to offer similar incentives in the future.\"\n\nApple’s China revenue dropped by 8% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, though CEO Tim Cook claimed on the company’s earnings call that iPhone sales in China grew over that time period, without providing specifics. Cook also said the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max were the two bestselling phones in \"urban China\".\n\nGreater China—a grouping that includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan—represented 19% of Apple's total 2023 revenue, making it the third-largest region by sales.\n\nThat datapoint contrasts with a steady drumbeat of independent analysis showing Apple struggling to hold onto its market share. Apple’s sales declined by 19.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, while Huawei and HONOR’s sales rose by 69.7% and 11.5% respectively, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\n\nHuawei’s sales have been on the rise since it released the Mate 60 Pro series of phones last August. The company released a new range of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70 series, in April. Two models of the Pura 70 series sold out on Huawei’s official online store just a minute after their release, according to Reuters.\n\nStory continues\n\nWong suggests that, instead of lowering prices, Apple needs to offer more \"wow\" factors for Chinese consumers. The company's Android competitors “have brought AI features and foldable form factor to the users to maintain customer stickiness”.\n\nApple is reportedly talking with companies like Google and China's Baidu to provide AI services for the iPhone. It's also working on a foldable phone, The Informationreported in February.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple’s payment business is heavily underappreciated among investors, said Evercore ISI analysts in a note, citing positive feedback from their conversations with an expert who previously worked building payments products at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\n“The call added to our conviction that Apple has some solid growth runway around Apple Pay, B2C payments, and potentially B2B payments over the long-term,” Evercore analysts noted.\n\n“Apple Pay remains the main focus and most of the moves they are making in the space are driven by a desire to increase Apple Pay adoption,” they added.\n\nThis includes recent efforts to work with companies to replace employee badges with Apple Pay, similar to how Apple collaborated with transit providers to replace transit cards with Apple Pay functionality.\n\nApple’s B2C payment initiatives have mainly centered around tap-to-pay, targeting micro-merchants and enabling them to turn their iPhones into point-of-sale devices.\n\nNow, the tech giant is partnering with companies like Stripe to provide businesses with a more comprehensive payment service. However, over time, the expert believes Apple may aim to handle the entire payment stack in-house, Evercore said.\n\n“The Expert also noted Apple could leverage its growing presence in the enterprise space to enable more B2B functionality over time rather than continuing to focus exclusively on B2C,” said analysts.\n\nOne area where Apple Pay trails behind peers like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is in the e-commerce space, Evercore pointed out.\n\nPayPal is widely accepted by over 70% of online retailers, whereas Apple Pay has much lower acceptance rate. Yet, Apple’s announcement of a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service could help close this gap, as many online retailers seek to offer a digital wallet and BNPL within a single solution.\n\n“If Apple can narrow this gap, we think a large portion of it’s 1B+ iPhone users would prefer to simply log into Apple Pay when making a purchase rather than re-entering payment information on every website they use,” the investment firm concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple's payments business remains largely underappreciated by investors\n\nEli Lilly's diabetes drug tirzepatide gets approval in China\n\nEuropean stocks dip as rate uncertainty weighs\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is betting a new generation of computers with specialized artificial intelligence chips and faster performance will revive the long-running rivalry between Windows PCs and Apple Inc.’s Mac.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran State TV Says ‘No Sign of Life’ at Helicopter Crash Site Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is ‘Well on the Way’ One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy\n\n“Apple’s done a fantastic job,” Nadella said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday. “We now want to bring real competition back to the Windows versus Mac.”\n\nMicrosoft unveiled a new category of AI-focused PCs called Copilot+PC. Thanks in part to a chip dedicated to AI processing, the company said, the machines from Microsoft’s Surface line and other manufacturers will be more powerful and 58% faster than Apple’s top-of-the-line MacBook Air M3. The new hardware will start at $1,000 and ship on June 18.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with Big Tech rivals in AI but is poised to lay out an ambitious strategy at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month. The company is placing high-end chips — similar to ones it designed for the Mac — in cloud-computing servers created to process the most advanced AI tasks coming to Apple devices, Bloomberg reported previously. Simpler AI-related features will be processed directly on iPhones, iPads and Macs.\n\nApple will focus on features that make life easier for users as they go about their day — say, by making suggestions and offering a customized experience.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging its relationship with leading AI startup OpenAI to forge an early lead in the burgeoning field of generative AI services. But the partnership has come under regulatory scrutiny. Officials in the US, Europe and the UK are examining Microsoft’s AI investments, as well as those of its rivals, to determine whether they impinge on competition or should be regulated more similarly to mergers.\n\nNadella said his company’s partnerships are increasing competition in the nascent field rather than constraining it.\n\n“Today there is formidable amount of competition, right?” he said. “Whether it is between the big players or the small players. So I don’t think that this is about any one company acquiring or not acquiring, but it’s about competition.”\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Monday as momentum on Wall Street stalled after buying into technology stocks, ahead of earnings from market darling Nvidia, put the Nasdaq at record highs.\n\nUncertainty over interest rates also remained in play as warnings on sticky inflation from Federal Reserve officials continued to trickle in, with focus on the minutes of the central bank’s late-April meeting due this Wednesday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,331.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.1% to 18,748.50 points by 19:20 ET (23:20 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,923.0 points.\n\nTech strengthens ahead of Nvidia earnings\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to report quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether the firm can meet market expectations for an exponential jump in earnings.\n\nThe company is seen as a bellwether for the rapidly growing artificial intelligence industry, and its earnings are likely to set the tone for the broader technology sector.\n\nNvidia is at the heart of a massive spike in market valuations over the past year, amid increasing hype over the rapidly-growing AI industry.\n\nTech stocks saw sustained buying ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, which also helped push the NASDAQ Composite to a record high close on Monday. The index vastly outperformed its Wall Street peers.\n\nNvidia rose 2.5% and was close to a record high. Its peers Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, with all three stocks seeing some gains in aftermarket trade.\n\nTech heavyweights including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) advanced between 0.4 and 1.3%.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% to 5,308.13 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.7% to a record high of 16,794.87 points on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, falling 0.5% to 39,806.77 points.\n\nMore Fed cues awaited amid rate uncertainty\n\nMarkets still remained on edge ahead of more cues from the Fed this week, specifically the minutes of its last meeting and addresses by several officials.\n\nWhile mildly softer consumer inflation readings for April sparked a rally on Wall Street, a slew of Fed officials warned that the bank still needed much more confidence that inflation was coming down, before it could begin cutting interest rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Tom Barkin and New York Fed President John Williams are set to speak later on Tuesday. Both officials are members of the Fed’s rate-setting committee.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe central bank is expected to potentially begin trimming rates by September, although this will also largely depend on the path of inflation.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures tread water; Nvidia anticipation puts Nasdaq at record high\n\nUS regulator to probe VinFast crash in California in which four died\n\nTrip.com ADR earnings missed by Â¥1.09, revenue fell short of estimates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft's AI chatbot will 'recall' everything you do on a PC",
        "content": "REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft wants laptop users to get so comfortable with its artificial intelligence chatbot that it will remember everything you're doing on your computer and help figure out what you want to do next.\n\nThe software giant on Monday revealed a new class of AI-imbued personal computers as it confronts heightened competition from Big Tech rivals in pitching generative AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nThe announcements ahead of Microsoft's annual Build developer conference centered on fusing its AI assistant, called Copilot, into the Windows operating system for PCs, where Microsoft already has the eyes of millions of consumers.\n\nThe new features will include Windows Recall, giving the AI assistant what Microsoft describes as “photographic memory” of a person's virtual activity. Microsoft promises to protect users' privacy by giving them the option to filter out what they don't want tracked, and keeping the tracking on the device.\n\nIt's a step toward machines that “instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings,” said CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n“We’re entering this new era where computers not only understand us, but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent,\" Nadella said at an event at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.\n\nThe conference that starts Tuesday in Seattle follows big AI announcements last week from rival Google, as well as Microsoft's close business partner OpenAI, which built the AI large language models on which Microsoft's Copilot is based.\n\nGoogle rolled out a retooled search engine that periodically puts AI-generated summaries over website links at the top of the results page; while also showing off a still-in-development AI assistant Astra that will be able to “see” and converse about things shown through a smartphone’s camera lens.\n\nChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled a new version of its chatbot last week, demonstrating an AI voice assistant with human characteristics that can banter about what someone's wearing and even attempt to assess a person’s emotions. The voice sounded so much like Scarlett Johansson playing an AI character in the sci-fi movie “Her” that OpenAI dropped the voice from its collection Monday.\n\nOpenAI also rolled out a new desktop version of ChatGPT designed for Apple's Mac computers.\n\nNext up is Apple's own annual developers conference in June. Apple CEO Tim Cook signaled at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in February that it has been making big investments in generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of Microsoft's announcements Monday appeared designed to blunt whatever Apple has in store. The newly AI-enhanced Windows PCs will start rolling out on June 18 on computers made by Microsoft partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, as well as on Microsoft's Surface line of devices. But they'll be reserved for premium models starting at $999.\n\nWhile Copilot is rooted in OpenAI's large language models, Microsoft said the new AI PCs will also rely heavily on its own homegrown “small language models” that are designed to be more efficient and able to more easily run on a consumer's personal device.\n\nPowered by Qualcomm chips, many of the computers will end up in the hands of workers at big organizations looking to refresh their inventory, said Gartner analyst Jason Wong.\n\nAI applications from graphics production to language translation “can now run locally without having to go back to the cloud to process it,” said Wong. “That’s going to help with what you can do without connected internet, and make it that much more high-performing.”\n\n—-\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft debuts new Copilot+ PCs using OpenAI's GPT-4o while taking shots at Apple",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is going all in on AI for the PC.\n\nThe company on Monday announced a new category of PCs called Copilot+ PCs, a new variety of computers equipped with so-called AI PC chips and running Microsoft's latest version of Windows 11 and its Copilot AI software.\n\nMicrosoft also revealed that its Copilot+ PCs will now run on OpenAI's GPT-4o model, allowing the assistant to interact with your PC via text, video, and voice. Users will also be able to share their screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app.\n\n\"The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert. This in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Monday. \"For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows.\"\n\nMicrosoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs to be purchased over the next year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gives his keynote during the company's Windows event on Monday, May 20 at its headquarters in Redmond. (Daniel Howley) (Howley)\n\nCopilot+ PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance.\n\nIn a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item.\n\nMicrosoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance.\n\nMicrosoft also touted the performance of its Copilot+ PCs and hammered home what it sees as a performance advantage over similar Apple (AAPL) devices.\n\nAccording to the company, a laptop running one of Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chips will provide 20% more battery life than Apple's MacBook Air, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance. The company also demonstrated Adobe's Photoshop running on its Surface laptop and beating Apple's MacBook Air with M3 chips in certain tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to rolling out Copilot+ PC versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro devices, Microsoft said this software will be featured in Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung products.\n\nMicrosoft's announcements come just a few weeks before rival Apple (AAPL) is expected to debut its own AI features across its product lines, including the iPhone and Mac, at its WWDC developer event on June 10.

        "content": "Microsoft To Unveil New Surface Devices At Redmond Event\n\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to reveal new hardware and software for consumer devices at an event on its Redmond, Washington campus on Monday.\n\nReuters reported that the announcement will include new versions of the Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, both of which will feature Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) chips based on Arm Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:ARM) architecture.\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips, equipped with a neural processing unit, will power the new devices, enhancing AI-focused applications like Microsoft’s Copilot software.\n\nThis move marks a significant shift from Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), whose processors have long dominated the PC market, towards lower-power Arm components vying for a share in Windows PCs.\n\nThis showcase comes just a day before Microsoft’s annual developer conference. Microsoft aims to solidify its position in the burgeoning market for consumer-friendly AI tools, a field in which it gained an early lead through its partnership with OpenAI.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft Unveils AMD-Powered AI Chips To Rival Nvidia: Report\n\nOpenAI and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently presented competing AI technologies capable of real-time, interruptible voice responses.\n\nGoogle’s updates include several new generative AI features for its search engine, underscoring the fierce competition among tech giants to lead in AI innovation.\n\nThe PC industry faces growing competition from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has seen success with its Arm-based custom chips, offering Macs enhanced battery life and performance.\n\nIn response, Microsoft has partnered with Qualcomm since 2016 to transition Windows to Arm’s architecture.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm’s exclusivity on Windows devices ends this year, potentially opening the market to other chipmakers like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nMicrosoft stock has gained more than 30% in the past 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and IShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW).\n\nPrice Action: MSFT shares are trading higher by 1.11% at $424.86 at the last check Monday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Microsoft’s Game-Changer!

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 20, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL and HP HPQ.\n\nIndustry: Mini-Computers\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2275316/2-stocks-to-watch-from-the-challenging-computer-industry\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Geopolitical challenges, including persistent inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Weak demand in China has been a headwind. However, industry participants are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones.\n\nIndustry participants like Apple and HP are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung.\n\nExpanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n\n3 Mini Computer Industry Trends to Watch\n\nEnterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\n\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPCs Face Extinction Risk: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, have been facing the risk of extinction due to the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. Stiff competition from smartphones has compelled global PC makers to not only upgrade hardware frequently but also add apps and cloud-based services to attract consumers. Nevertheless, the emergence of 5G, AI, machine learning and foldable computers is likely to be the key catalysts in expanding the total addressable market of PCs.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #222, which places it in the bottom 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since May 31, 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry’s 2024 earnings has moved down 2%.\n\nGiven the dim outlook, there are only a few stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\n\nThe industry has gained 8.2% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s return of 26.3% and the broader sector’s growth of 39%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.62X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.19X and the sector’s 26.82X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.32X and as low as 13.92X, with the median being 24.65X.\n\n2 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now\n\nApple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store’s traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has increased by 0.5% to $6.57 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has declined 1.4% in the year-to-date period.\n\nHP: This Zacks Rank #3 company’s sustained focus on launching the latest and innovative products is likely to help it stay afloat in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.\n\nProduct innovation and differentiations are the key drivers that have helped HPQ maintain its leading position in the PC and printer markets.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $3.42 per share over the past 30 days. HP shares have gained 3.3% year to date.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Apple slashes prices of iPhone 15 models to new low in China amid heated competition in world's largest smartphone market",
        "content": "Apple is offering a new range of steep discounts for iPhone 15 models to consumers in mainland China, with online retail platforms bringing prices to a new low amid the US tech giant's efforts to boost sluggish sales in the world's biggest smartphone market.\n\nThe top-of-the-line 256-gigabyte iPhone 15 Pro Max model, for example, on Monday started selling for 7,949 yuan (US$1,100) on Apple's official online stores on JD.com and Alibaba Group Holding's Tmall platform - down 2,050 yuan, or 20 per cent off, from its 9,999-yuan price tag when the new series was released last September. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe basic 128GB iPhone 15 model, meanwhile, now costs 23 per cent less at 4,599 yuan, down from its previous price of 5,999 yuan, on both JD.com and Tmall. The sale runs from May 20 to 28, according to the two platforms.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nApple's mainland online Apple Store, however, kept the recent prices of iPhone 15 models unchanged. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\nA large iPhone 15 Pro advertisement is displayed on a large screen at the Apple Store in Wangfujing Street in Beijing.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nThe aggressive discounts on the two major online platforms show the lengths being taken by Apple to reinvigorate domestic demand for its flagship product, more than a month after iPhone sales in the firm's Greater China region - comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan - declined 8 per cent to US$16.4 billion in the March quarter.\n\nApple's atypical iPhone discount drive on Chinese online marketplaces started in January, following online and offline campaigns of rival Chinese smartphone vendors - including Xiaomi and Honor - that knocked down prices on their various Android models.\n\nDiscounts of up to 800 yuan were offered by Apple through its mainland online store in the same month, covering iPhones, iPads, MacBook laptops, AirPods and the Apple Watch.\n\nPeople check out various iPhone 15 models at Apple's launch event in the firm's headquarters in Cupertino, California, on September 12, 2023.

Photo: AP>\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the March quarter, the iPhone's share of the mainland smartphone market shrank to 15.7 per cent, down from 20.2 per cent a year earlier, amid stiff domestic competition, according to a report by market research firm Counterpoint. Apple was overtaken by Vivo's 17.4 per cent share and Honor's 16.1 per cent.\n\nHuawei Technologies, which had been riding its successful 5G handset comeback with the Mate 60 Pro, was ranked fourth with a 15.5 per cent market share in the same period.\n\nStill, the recent iPhone discount drives appear to have helped Apple. Shipments of foreign-branded smartphones in March grew 12 per cent from the same period last year, according to data published earlier this month by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology earlier this month. The state-run academy did not identify the brand, but the bulk of foreign handsets sold on the mainland are from Apple.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple has launched an aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models.\n\nThe discounting comes as the U.S. tech giant seeks to defend its position in the high-end smartphone market, where it faces increasing competition from local rivals such as Huawei.\n\nRunning from May 20 to May 28, it is more substantial than the one Apple offered in February.\n\nWhile the highest discount in the February campaign was 1,150 yuan, this time discounts are up to 2,300 yuan. The steepest discount applies to the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max model, while other models also see significant price cuts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor instance, the 128 GB version of the base iPhone 15 model has a discount of 1,400 yuan, according to Reuters' checks on Monday.\n\nThe increased competitive pressure on Apple comes after Huawei last month introduced its new series of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70, following the launch of the Mate 60 last August.\n\nApple's previous discounting effort in February appears to have helped the company mitigate a sales slowdown in China.\n\nApple's shipments in China increased by 12% in March, according to Reuters' calculations based on data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). This marks a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales.\n\n($1 = 7.2319 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Casey Hall; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Expects to Add at Least $11 Billion to This Investment in the Second Quarter",
        "content": "Warren Buffett knows it only takes a few smart investments to produce massive market-beating returns.\n\nHe told shareholders that in the 58 years or so that he's been managing Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), there have only been a half-dozen to a dozen decisions that have made an impact on its success as a business. The real secret: \"We only swing at pitches we like,\" he said, a baseball metaphor he has used for over 25 years.\n\nRecently, there haven't been a lot of pitches in Buffett's sweet spot: Berkshire's stock sales have exceeded its purchases in each of the last six quarters. But there's one big holding that Buffett expects to keep adding to in the second quarter, and investors can't ignore it. Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAnother $11 billion going toward Berkshire's largest holding\n\nMost investors know that Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire's largest equity holding. Despite the sell-off of a portion of its stake in the company over the last two quarters for tax purposes, it remains Buffett's biggest bet in the stock market. The Oracle of Omaha expects that to remain the case for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut far exceeding the value of its stake in Apple is Berkshire's cash and cash equivalents position. That position reached $189 billion by the end of the first quarter. And Berkshire invests the vast majority of that cash in short-term U.S. Treasury bills.\n\nShort-term U.S. Treasuries are Buffett's preferred place to park cash because they offer safety and liquidity. In today's market, he gets those two benefits and a nice interest rate to boot. The three-month Treasury yield sits around 5.4% as of this writing.\n\nAs such, Buffett is totally fine stockpiling cash and investing it into Treasuries. \"It's a fair assumption that they'll probably be at about $200 billion at the end of the quarter,\" Buffett said of Berkshire's Treasury holdings. He said he would still have a big pile of cash even if yields were much lower (but don't tell the Federal Reserve).\n\n\"We'd love to spend it,\" he told shareholders. \"But we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and could make us a lot of money.\"\n\nThose opportunities are few and far between. As Buffett notes, he has only really made a handful of big decisions to alter the course of Berkshire during his 58-year tenure. And as Berkshire gets bigger, the opportunities shrink because \"a lot of money\" now means tens of billions of dollars instead of tens of millions. There are only so many investment opportunities that can move the needle at this point.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould investors follow Buffett's lead?\n\nBuffett's recent spell of stock sales and growing cash pile might give many investors the message that they should be accumulating cash as well. And with interest rates where they are, cash isn't a complete drag on returns like it has been in the past. Still, I don't think Buffett would recommend most investors manage their portfolio like he manages Berkshire's.\n\nHe thinks individual investors have a big advantage over big institutional investors, even Berkshire Hathaway. Referring to his late partner, Charlie Munger, he said: \"Ten million, I think Charlie or I could earn high returns on because I think there's just a few things that happen on a very small scale.\" Considering most individual investors are managing much less than $10 million, that means there are still opportunities to outperform the overall market.\n\nThe ability for individual investors to move in and out of small stocks without significantly impacting the market price is a big advantage. Indeed, small-cap stocks are currently undervalued relative to their historic levels, while large-cap stocks are overvalued, and megacap stocks might be even more overvalued.\n\nThe small-cap segment of the market could present unique investment opportunities for individuals, but it's not a field Berkshire Hathaway can play in.\n\nEven for investors who prefer the stability of large-cap stocks, taking Buffett's top recommendation and investing in an S&P 500 index fund isn't a bad idea right now either.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $566,624!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Today, we delve into the world of hedge fund titan Paul Tudor Jones and explore three Paul Tudor Jones stocks that offer a glimpse into his investment strategy. Jones has a knack for spotting opportunities in overlooked corners of the market. His investment philosophy, which balances macroeconomic insights with quantitative analysis, has guided Tudor Investment Corp. to remarkable heights. All across the globe, investors are seeking out stocks backed by Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nFrom technological advancements to shifts in consumer behavior, the variables influencing stock performance on Wall Street are numerous. However, Paul Tudor Jones’ recent moves highlight his confidence in specific sectors that promise robust growth and stability. These include technology, green energy, and consumer goods—areas that not only align with current market trends but also resonate with forward-thinking investment strategies.\n\nMany on Wall Street note that the firm’s approach is meticulous, focusing on diversification, market timing, and, most importantly, resilience in the face of market volatilities. For those looking to invest like a hedge fund king, understanding the dynamics behind Jones’ choices is important. Therefore, today we discuss three Paul Tudor Jones stocks and exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), handpicked from his portfolio, representing a unique blend of stability and growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks Backed by Paul Tudor Jones: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong Paul Tudor Jones stocks we are covering is the diversified health care company UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). The business operates through four main segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx. These units focus on a wide range of health care needs, from insurance coverage and benefits to pharmacy care services and health management solutions. UnitedHealth’s integrated business model allows it to serve millions of patients, leveraging vast data insights while managing costs effectively.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, UnitedHealth Group reported strong performance across its business segments. As a result, revenues came in at $99.8 billion, up nearly $8 billion year-over-year (YoY). Management grew its commercial benefits significantly, adding 2 million more people. Optum Health is on track to expand its value-based care arrangements, while Optum Rx saw a 12% revenue growth. Despite challenges such as the recent cyberattack, the company reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, UnitedHealth Group is focused on modernizing the health care system and expanding its value-based care offerings, which are expected to drive sustainable long-term growth. The reaffirmed long-term earnings-per-share (“EPS”) growth objective of 13-16% highlights the company’s confidence in its strategic direction and operational capabilities. In addition, UnitedHealth Group’s significant investments in technology, particularly in data analytics and telehealth, are expected to drive future growth.\n\nYear-to-date, UNH stock has traded flat, in part due to Wall Street concerns over the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Meanwhile, the current dividend yield is 1.4% and the shares are trading at 19 times forward earnings. Analysts are eyeing an upward move of over 8% in the 12 months ahead. If you’re looking for a robust business model and a strategic approach to growth and innovation in the health care market, then UnitedHealth Group stock needs to be on your radar. Easily, this is one of the best stocks backed by Paul Tudor Jones.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a website\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnimal health heavyweight Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the next company among our featured Paul Tudor Jones stocks. The company develops animal health medicines and vaccines, serving a large market, including livestock and companion animals.\n\nAt present, Zoetis has a market capitalization (cap) of approximately $80 billion. Zoetis’s first quarter of 2024 was marked by a 12% operational revenue growth and a 15% increase in adjusted net income. The company has raised its operational guidance for 2024. There has been strong demand for its companion animal products and robust performance across its parasiticide and dermatology franchises. The launch of new products like Librela and Solensia for osteoarthritis in dogs and cats has also contributed to recent growth.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Zoetis’s financial performance, projecting a steady increase in EPS” in the coming years. For the fiscal year 2024, the mean EPS estimate stands at $5.77. Expectations rise to $6.37 by 2025 and $7.02 by 2026. Meanwhile, Zoetis continues to expand its presence in emerging markets, where the demand for animal healthcare products is growing rapidly. The company’s focus on countries such as China, Brazil, and India positions it well to capture growth opportunities in these regions.\n\nYet, so far in 2024, ZTS stock has declined about 11.5%, while the shares are changing hands at a forward price-to-earnings (“P/E”) ratio of 30x. Finally, the current 12-month price forecast suggests a potential increase of over 25%. Interested readers should also note the dividend yield of 1%.\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) S&P 500 on wooden blocks as someone turns an arrow pointing either up or down. SPY stock. Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Dmitry Demidovich / Shutterstock\n\nWe end our discussion of Paul Tudor Jones stocks with an ETF, namely the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), which gives access to the S&P 500 index, the barometer for the U.S. market. The index, managed by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), is a market-capitalization-weighted index comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies stateside. It covers approximately 80% of available market cap. As of May 2024, the total market cap of the S&P 500 stands at approximately $44 trillion. About a year ago, it was around $34 trillion.\n\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is one of the widely traded and largest ETFs in the world. At present, SPY manages over $525 billion in assets. In terms of sectors, information technology leads the list with 30%. Then we see financials (30%), health care (12%), communication services (9%), and industrials (8%), among others. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are SPY’s four largest holdings, comprising about 22% of the fund’s roster.\n\nAs of date, SPY has posted a YTD gain of approximately 11%. This alignment with the resturn of the S&P 500 index underscores the ETF’s effectiveness in providing exposure to the index. Potential investors should also note the dividend yield of 1.3% and the annual expense ratio of 0.09% for SPY while they may consider the fund as a Paul Tudor Jones stock.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) investors have been on a roller coaster in recent years, with an economic downturn bringing the iPhone maker's stock plunging 27% in 2022. The company's shares rebounded 48% the following year. However, repeated hits to its business and revenue declines throughout 2023 have seen its stock dip 1% since the start of this year.\n\nWall Street has grown wary of Apple's iPhone-dependent business as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to a decline in product sales. However, recent quarterly results and moves to prioritize more digital businesses suggest the company is moving in a better direction.\n\nApple's digital services segment consistently outpaces the iPhone and is on track to become its highest-earning division. Meanwhile, a gradual expansion into artificial intelligence (AI) could see the company profit from the tailwinds of a $200 billion (and growing) industry for years. As a result, now could be the best time to invest in Apple, as it is at the start of a major shift in its business model.\n\nSo, here are three reasons to buy Apple stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. A highly profitable services business\n\nApple's services segment includes income from its App Store and subscription-based platforms like Apple TV+, Music, Fitness+, and more. The bulk of the company's services launched in 2019, and the division quickly became the most profitable part of Apple's business.\n\nServices regularly hit gross margins above 70%, achieving 75% in the second quarter of 2024 (a year-over-year improvement of about 4%). For reference, products' profit margins hover around 36%.\n\nMoreover, its services consistently outperform those of Apple's other segments. Q2 2024 saw revenue for the digital business rise 14% year over year, while iPhone sales fell 10% and iPad revenue tumbled 17%.\n\nServices have diversified and strengthened Apple's business, allowing it to lean less on product sales amid poor market conditions. The segment is expanding rapidly, illustrating a promising shift in Apple's priorities from physical offerings to its more profitable digital products.\n\n2. The brand power and financial resources to go far in AI\n\nDespite recent challenges, Apple remains a behemoth in consumer tech. Thanks to nearly unrivaled brand loyalty, the company dominates multiple product markets, with leading market shares in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. Sales have dipped over the last year, but the company is making moves to boost its product business with AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has gradually added AI-enabled features to its product lineup since the start of 2023, but now it appears to be quickening the pace. On May 7, the company hosted its \"Let Loose\" event, where it debuted its newest iPad Pro -- the first device powered by Apple's new M4 chip.\n\nThe chip is Apple's most powerful one yet, considerably expanding the company's AI capabilities. The launch appears to be a preview of what Apple will reveal at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where experts believe it will debut a range of new AI-powered tools.\n\nMoreover, Bloomberg reported last month that Apple plans to overhaul its Mac line of computers to focus on AI and is powering its AI software with data centers filled with in-house-designed chips.\n\nApple's dominance in consumer tech could land it a lucrative role in AI. While companies like Microsoft and Amazon are primarily focused on the commercial side of AI, Apple has honed in on consumers. The widespread use of its products could see Apple become a significant growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, improving its recent product slump and boosting revenue for years.\n\n3. A record $110 billion share buyback plan\n\nOn May 2, Apple announced the biggest stock buyback in history, revealing plans to buy back $110 billion worth of stock. The move saw shares in Apple pop 8% in after-market trading, instilling some confidence in investors for the company's future.\n\nBuybacks often occur because executives believe the company's stock is undervalued. As a result, a major buyback could be a sign that management believes in the direction Apple is moving in, making its stock an attractive option.\n\nApple has faced more than a few challenges over the last year, but I wouldn't bet against its long-term future. Its stock is trading 29 times its forward earnings, compared to Microsoft's 35 times and Amazon's 40 times. It may not be a bargain, but the figures suggest Apple could be one of the best-valued stocks in AI. Alongside a lucrative services business, Apple is worth buying like there's no tomorrow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could Warren Buffett Like This Stock More Than Apple Because of Its Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity?",
        "content": "Anyone familiar with Warren Buffett knows the famous investor likes Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). He has called the company a better business than any of Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries and better than longtime Berkshire holdings American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nHowever, another company is attracting Buffett's attention even more these days: Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Could Buffett like this stock more than Apple because of its once-in-a-generation opportunity?\n\nOccidental's once-in-a-generation opportunity\n\nThe company has produced petroleum since 1920,  and it's been a long time since the oil business presented a massive shiny new opportunity for investors. But Occidental is pouring billions of dollars into an up-and-coming technology that could be another once-in-a-generation source of riches -- carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nAs its name indicates, CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide and storing it so it doesn't affect the atmosphere. It has become a hot area of development due to increasing concerns about the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on climate change.\n\nOccidental is focusing on direct air capture (DAC), a type of CCS where carbon dioxide is removed from the air. It acquired DAC pioneer Carbon Engineering last year for $1.1 billion. The company plans to build up to 135 DAC plants.\n\nWhat will Occidental do with all of the carbon dioxide sucked from the air? President and CEO Vicki Hollub wants to use much of it in oil production. Her goal is for \"net-zero\" oil where the carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere cancels out the carbon dioxide emitted by burning the oil. The company has also already begun selling carbon credits to other companies.\n\nExxonMobil predicts CCS will be a $4 trillion business by 2050, and Occidental is one of the leaders in this nascent market. If the company's technology can be successfully scaled, Occidental could continue producing oil for decades to come without worries about its climate impact.\n\nDoes Buffett like Occidental more than Apple?\n\nBuffett has expressed support for Occidental's carbon capture initiatives. But does he really like Occidental more than Apple? There are at least two reasons to think he might.\n\nMost importantly, the legendary investor continues to aggressively buy shares of Occidental but sold nearly 13% of Berkshire's stake in Apple during the first quarter of 2024. Berkshire owns 28% of Occidental and has secured regulatory approval to acquire up to 50% of the company.\n\nIn his latest letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett listed eight stocks he expects Berkshire to \"maintain indefinitely.\" Occidental was one of them, but Apple wasn't.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it's easy to argue that Apple remains Buffett's favorite stock. For one thing, the tech giant still makes up 39.7% of Berkshire's portfolio. That's nearly four times larger than the conglomerate's second-largest holding (Bank of America) and almost 10x the size of its position in Occidental. Buffett also said in Berkshire's recent shareholder meeting that Apple would likely continue to rank as the largest position.\n\nGood picks for different reasons\n\nMaybe Buffett likes Occidental more than Apple; maybe not. Either way, I think both companies are good picks for different reasons.\n\nCarbon capture truly could present a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Occidental. I suspect the stock has significant upside potential, especially with Berkshire buying additional shares on a regular basis.\n\nApple could have yet another once-in-a-generation moment of its own with artificial intelligence (AI). The company is widely expected to introduce multiple AI innovations at its Worldwide Developers' Conference in June. I think it's possible Apple could enjoy a new supercycle of iPhone upgrades over the next few years, thanks to AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "content": "All eyes have been on tech companies since a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) kicked off last year.\n\nBig Tech companies like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have rallied investors, with the stock up 69% in the last 12 months. The retail giant has gained support by delivering solid growth in its e-commerce segment and investing heavily in the budding AI market. Amazon is on a promising growth path that might see it flourish over the long term.\n\nHowever, it could be worth investing in a company that is at an earlier stage in its AI venture (with potentially more room to run) and has a history of outperforming Amazon's stock. AAPL Chart\n\nAmazon has made many millionaires over the years, with its share price nearly doubling since 2019. However, the chart above shows Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has climbed almost three times higher than Amazon's in the same period.\n\nApple has taken a slower approach to AI than Amazon since the start of 2023, but recent developments suggest Apple is gearing up to make a big splash in the sector this year.\n\nSo, forget Amazon. Apple has made far more millionaires and will continue to make more.\n\nAn edge over the AI consumer market\n\nApple has achieved almost unrivaled brand loyalty with its customers over the years. Consumer preference for its products was best conveyed by Warren Buffett last year when he said, \"If someone offered you $10,000 to never buy an iPhone again, you wouldn't take it.\" While surprising, the sentiment rings true for millions of consumers who would sooner give up many other brands before straying from Apple.\n\nThe company has strategically created an interconnected ecosystem for its devices that discourages users from switching to rival products. Advanced connectivity and Apple-exclusive apps like Messages and FaceTime have become integral to many people's workflows, keeping them within the company's ecosystem even when it comes time to upgrade.\n\nApple has achieved leading market shares in many of its product categories, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones. Meanwhile, the wide use of its products allowed the company to quickly expand in digital products, with its services segment becoming its second-highest earning division (only after the iPhone).\n\nServices quarterly revenue has risen 36% over the last three years, significantly outpacing the iPhone's growth of 16%.\n\nIt's no secret that Amazon similarly has a vast user base, with its retail site available in about 20 countries. Meanwhile, it's home to the world's biggest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), where it is rapidly expanding its AI offerings to businesses. However, Apple could arguably fare better in the consumer space of AI over the long term by leveraging the popularity of its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone maker's devices could become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, proven by the success Apple has already had touting its digital services. On May 7, Apple held its \"Let Loose\" event, where it debuted its newest iPad Pro. The tablet is the first device to be equipped with Apple's M4 chip, its most powerful chip yet.\n\nThe M4 significantly expands Apple's AI capabilities and is a promising look into the company's future in AI. Apple will hold its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where it is expected to build on its recent event by unveiling a range of new AI-powered features. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported in April that the company plans to overhaul its Mac lineup to focus on AI offerings.\n\nApple is a far better value than Amazon\n\nAmazon has won over many investors this year. However, while its rally has benefited current investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones. Meanwhile, recent hurdles have kept Apple's stock at a more attractive price point. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart shows Apple has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow ratio. These are helpful metrics when determining a stock's value as they take into account the company's financial position. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. And Apple wins on both fronts.\n\nMoreover, Apple's free cash flow of $101 billion is far higher than Amazon's $46 billion, suggesting Apple could be better equipped to invest in its business and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nAlongside immense brand loyalty and an expanding position in AI, Apple's stock is a no-brainer that could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $578,143!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

This Data Shows Why US Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early\n\nUS District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, heard a fourth day of testimony to determine whether the iPhone maker is abiding by a 2021 court order in an antitrust case brought by Fortnite-maker Epic Games Inc., which included allowing app developers to link to payment options not controlled by Apple.\n\nCarson Oliver, senior director for business management for the App Store, testified Friday that Apple hired economic consulting firm Analysis Group Inc. to help create a new commission rate for purchases.\n\nBut Rogers repeatedly chastised Oliver for statements about how Apple decided it would charge developers 27% for purchases of digital goods or services made outside its App Store, given that the lowest end of the range in the Analysis Group study is 12.3%.\n\n“How did you justify the other 15% you are charging?” she said.\n\nApple provides a number of services to developers including discovery of apps, distribution, developer tools and platform technology, along with additional privacy, user trust and safety that aren’t comparable to other platforms, Oliver testified. He said Apple estimates the true low-end was 17%.\n\nAnalysis Group estimated what each of those categories was worth by comparing them to what is charged by platforms including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Etsy Inc. and Shopify Inc.\n\nThe Analysis Group study found the value of those services would amount to between 12.3% at the low end or 92% at the high end depending on factors like the size of the developer, Oliver said.\n\n“And you are charging 27%,” Rogers interjected.\n\nOliver said Apple executives believe the effective rate of the commission is lower than that.\n\n“That’s a big assumption,” the judge replied. “Your assumptions are just that — they are assumptions. There’s no data for it.”\n\n“That’s not true,” Oliver said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’ Walgreens and CVS Are Trying to Fix America’s Flailing Pharmacies How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Milei Targets Labor Law That’s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance The DNA Test Delusion\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple’s iPad Pro is its most incredible product, but software holds it back",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) latest 13-inch iPad Pro is a marvel of engineering.\n\nBut software still hamstrings the iPad Pro’s true potential, relegating the device to a sleek, high-end package for consuming content rather than allowing the iPad Pro to realize its productivity potential.\n\nThe company has packed its latest M4 processor with up to 10 CPU and 10 GPU cores, more than you’ll find in its current MacBook Air and at least one version of its MacBook Pro, into a tablet thinner than Apple’s iPod Nano.\n\nAt just 5.1 millimeters thick, the iPad Pro feels like if you hold it by one end, the other will droop like a piece of loose-leaf paper. It doesn’t, of course. The 11-inch iPad Pro is almost as thin at 5.3 mm.\n\nOh, and then there’s the new Ultra Retina XDR display. Apple says the screen combines two OLED panels to boost its overall brightness while offering the same exceptional benefits you’d get out of a normal OLED display. That means inky blacks and brilliant colors.\n\nAnd all of that is going to cost you. A base 13-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s Magic Keyboard will set you back $1,648. That’s more than a high-end 13-inch MacBook Air and an entry-level MacBook Pro.\n\nI could deal with that price, though, if the iPad Pro didn’t have one big setback — iPadOS. Customers are experiencing the newly released iPad Pro and iPad Air at the Apple Store in Shanghai, China, on May 15, 2024. (Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nSoftware hangups\n\nOver the years, the iPad has made progress toward offering more Mac-like capabilities.\n\nYou can run multiple apps at the same time, connect to an external display for a larger workspace, group apps together, and more.\n\nBut iPadOS still holds back the iPad Pro from its true potential.\n\nI’ve written this entire review on the iPad Pro. And while it’s served me well, I’m still limited by how I can arrange windows. The fact that I can only run four apps on screen at the same time without having to grab them from the side panel and that apps still default to their iPad versions rather than a full Mac version are among the biggest roadblocks.\n\nIt’s these kinds of things that make it hard to use the iPad Pro as a full laptop replacement, even though that’s clearly how Apple wants you to think of the tablet.\n\nTo say I’m torn is an understatement. I love how powerful the iPad Pro is, how gorgeous its display is, and how incredibly thin it is. But I also want it to do more with all of that than it does.\n\nApple is clearly worried that if it turns the iPad Pro into more of a Mac, it’ll cannibalize MacBook sales.\n\nAnd that’s probably true. After all, if you’ve got the cash to burn, an iPad Pro with macOS would be easy to recommend over the MacBook Air.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean the Air loses its value, though: It would still serve as a fantastic entry-level laptop for Apple while the MacBook Pro would continue to stand as the company’s most powerful portable computer.\n\nStory continues\n\nA laptop killer by almost every measurement\n\nThe new iPad Pro blows away most super thin laptops on the market.\n\nIts massive touch screen is fantastic, the Magic Keyboard is as responsive and comfortable to type on as a standard MacBook, and its trackpad is spacious and offers haptic feedback when you click it.\n\nOn top of that, it’s got a new camera on the right side that, when you’re using the iPad Pro in landscape mode, acts as a solid front camera that automatically keeps you in frame via its Center Stage feature. Stereo speakers also help when you want to use it as your mini TV on the go or for meetings or whatever.\n\nAnd did I mention its M4 chip is absurd for how thin this tablet is? I ran the Geekbench benchmark, which tests the performance of the CPU, on the iPad Pro and my wife’s 2023 MacBook Air with an M2 processor, and the iPad practically suplexed the Air straight through my coffee table. Figuratively, speaking.\n\nIt also easily beat out my 2021 MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip and 32GB of RAM.\n\nThere's no way around it — the 13-inch iPad Pro is an absolute monster, especially for its size.\n\nApple will host its annual WWDC event on June 10, and there’s an outside chance the company could announce an update to the iPad Pro that will make it a true laptop killer. At least that’s what I’m hoping for.\n\nAnd if you’re in the market for a high-powered iPad that knocks the socks off of any other tablet, the Pro is the way to go. If you can get around Apple’s software decisions, then you should also grab one.\n\nBut if you’re hoping this Pro is the laptop replacement you’ve been waiting for, you’re out of luck.

        "title": "Rally Rockets: 3 Stocks Benefitting From the Market’s Unstoppable Surge",
        "content": "Major indices continue to climb Despite ongoing concerns over sticky inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Many shares defy the traditional “sell in May and go away” adage. This trend leaves investors wondering which stocks to buy to ride the ongoing surge in equities.\n\nStudies show that the S&P 500 Index has enjoyed 27 bull markets between 1928 and 2023, with an average gain of nearly 115% over an average period of 2.7 years. From 1987 to 2000, the longest bull market achieved an impressive gain of 582%. In June 2023, the S&P 500 re-entered bull market territory, displaying strong momentum. Research provider CFRA recently raised its 12-month target to over 5,600, citing optimistic profit growth expectations.\n\nAlthough concerns persist about high valuations in the technology sector and the potential volatility surrounding the presidential election in November, market sentiment remains positive. Anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and earnings growth could create a favorable environment for further gains. Let’s explore three of the best stocks to buy, poised to benefit from the current market momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) provides medications across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cancer and chronic pain. Its strong product portfolio, consistent revenue growth, and potential for future breakthroughs make LLY stock the first name on our stock list.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Eli Lilly reported a remarkable 26% increase in revenue, primarily driven by the successful launch of new products like Mounjaro and Zepbound. Wall Street has been impressed with the pharma company’s ability to innovate and effectively bring new products to market.\n\nMeanwhile, its gross margin also saw an impressive rise from 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023 to 82.5% in the first quarter of this year. Eli Lilly benefited from higher prices and an improved product mix, underscoring the company’s operational efficiency and pricing power. Operating income in the same period grew by 63%, and earnings per share increased by 59%. Looking ahead, Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to between $42.4 billion and $43.6 billion. The company also anticipates further margin expansion.\n\nAs a result, LLY stock has advanced 30% year-to-date (YTD), hovering slightly below all-time highs. Yet, the shares are expensive, trading at 56 times forward earnings and 19 times sales. Nonetheless, Wall Street is expecting further gains from the pharma stock, as the 12-month average price stands at $877.50, presenting an upside potential of 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet (FN) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list of stocks to buy is Fabrinet (NYSE:FN). Its equipment enables the transmission of massive data volumes at high speeds. With data demand constantly rising and a wide range of services ranging from optical packaging to precision manufacturing, Fabrinet deserves your attention as a long-term investment.\n\nAnalysts point out that Fabrinet has demonstrated robust financial health with a market cap of $8.4 billion. In early May, management released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Exceeding guidance, quarterly revenue was $731.5 million, compared to $665.3 million for the same period 12 months ago. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $2.39, compared to $1.94 for the year-ago quarter.\n\nWall Street was pleased about the growth in optical communications revenues, particularly from datacom revenue, which grew 150% YOY. Management is optimistic about its position in the high data rate datacom market. Fabrinet’s operating and net profit margins currently stand at 9.6 and 9.9%, respectively. In other words, management has successfully navigated the competitive manufacturing landscape to maintain profitability.\n\nSince the start of the year, FN stock has returned 22%, rallying significantly after announcing better-than-expected financial results. Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 26.2 times forward earnings and 3.1 times sales. Given the extent of the recent rally in Fabrinet shares, potential investors may consider waiting for a pullback towards the $220 level. Fabrinet will likely continue its growth trajectory in future quarters, making it a compelling stock to buy within the tech manufacturing sector.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) Blocks that spell out ETF in front of jar with money and change.\n\nSource: SHUN_J / Shutterstock\n\nLarge-cap growth stocks typically thrive in rapidly expanding industries like technology and biotech. Known for high growth rates and valuations, these companies are expected to outpace other established stocks. Such growth shares may offer a blend of stability and significant long-term potential, making them an important part of many portfolios.\n\nTherefore, the Vanguard Growth ETF is next on our list of stocks to buy (NYSEARCA:VUG). This fund allows investors to replicate the performance of leading large-cap U.S. growth stocks. Launched in January 2004, the ETF offers broad exposure to about 200 companies.\n\nOver half of VUG’s holdings are in technology stocks (56%), followed by consumer discretionary (19%), industrials (9%) and healthcare (8%) sectors. The top 10 holdings collectively account for over half of the fund’s net assets of $226 billion. Among the top names are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Visa (NYSE:V) and others.\n\nSince January, with a gain of over 11%, VUG has outperformed many individual stocks and the benchmark indices. By comparison, the Nasdaq 100 index has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 5%. Currently, the VUG fund trades at 38 times trailing earnings and 10 times book value. With a competitive expense ratio of 0.04% and a modest 0.5% dividend yield, VUG remains an appealing option for investors seeking exposure to large-cap growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "2 Stocks to Watch From the Challenging Computer Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Geopolitical challenges, including persistent inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Weak demand in China has been a headwind. However, industry participants are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Industry participants like Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n\n3 Mini Computer Industry Trends to Watch\n\nEnterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\r\n\r\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\r\n\r\nPCs Face Extinction Risk: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, have been facing the risk of extinction due to the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. Stiff competition from smartphones has compelled global PC makers to not only upgrade hardware frequently but also add apps and cloud-based services to attract consumers. Nevertheless, the emergence of 5G, AI, machine learning and foldable computers is likely to be the key catalysts in expanding the total addressable market of PCs.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #222, which places it in the bottom 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\r\n\r\nThe industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since May 31, 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry’s 2024 earnings has moved down 2%.\r\n\r\nGiven the dim outlook, there are only a few stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\r\n\r\nThe industry has gained 8.2% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s return of 26.3% and the broader sector’s growth of 39%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.62X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.19X and the sector’s 26.82X.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.32X and as low as 13.92X, with the median being 24.65X, as the charts below show.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n2 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now\n\nApple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. \r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store’s traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has increased by 0.5% to $6.57 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has declined 1.4% in the year-to-date period.\n\nPrice and Consensus: AAPL\n\nHP: This Zacks Rank #3 company’s sustained focus on launching the latest and innovative products is likely to help it stay afloat in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.\r\n\r\nProduct innovation and differentiations are the key drivers that have helped HPQ maintain its leading position in the PC and printer markets.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $3.42 per share over the past 30 days. HP shares have gained 3.3% year to date.\n\nPrice and Consensus: HPQ\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +13.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 12.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.2%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.20 indicates a change of +9.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAPL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $83.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.7%. The $384.62 billion and $405.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.4% and +5.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.\n\nBut the interesting question to answer is: Is Apple really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller?\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller surprised the market when he revealed a new take in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in his first quarter holdings data. Duquesne Capital bought a $19.6 million stake in Nvidia in the March quarter. After dumping Apple shares in the early 2011, Stanley Druckenmiller never took interest in the stock which remained one of the favorites of hedge funds throughout these years. But his latest move indicates the value investor is expecting a new bull run in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is struggling to take off with its AI plans. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are down about 1% year to date. All eyes are now on Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference as investors believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will reveal some blockbuster AI plans in the event.\n\nDoes Apple Have Any AI Catalysts?\n\nThe closet Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has come to any meaningful AI offering is its new plan to integrate ChatGPT in its iOS 18. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a notable Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bull, called the possible deal between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and OpenAI a \"golden goose\" for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tim Cook. Ives reiterated a Buy rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $250 price target.\n\nRisks Around Apple Stock\n\nApple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) list of risks is long. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced consecutive quarters of revenue declines as its iPhone business, Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bread and butter so far, continues to face growth challenges amid rising competition in China and customers' lack of enthusiasm to buy new iPhones. Major stakeholders like Warren Buffett are also starting to cut their stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). To turn things around when it comes to the stock price, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a historic a $110 billion stock buyback program. But that didn’t move the needle much for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares.\n\nValuation and Comparison with Peers\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at around 29 times earnings. Estimates suggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects to make $6.53 a share in FY2024 on about $385.8 billion in sales, while EPS in fiscal 2025 is expected to come in at $7.13. When compared to peers like Microsoft, which are growing at a much faster rate and have their AI roadmap all in place, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock looks overvalued according to many analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\niPhone Demand Expected to Remain Weak\n\nUnless Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulls a miracle or out-of-this-world innovation, iPhone demand isn’t expected to rebound anytime soon due to a plethora of competitors which are making cheaper but quality smartphones, and rising inflation which is hurting consumer buying power. KeyBanc Capital Markets recently said in a report that iPhone demand in April was also \"soft.\"\n\nInsider Monkey's database shows that 131 out of 933 elite money managers had stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), down from 134 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nThe London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Reduced: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Reduction reflects strong performance in 2023 and resulting elevated valuation. We believe the outlook for AAPL remains strong with slow growth in iPhone (now #1 global market share) and faster growth in the higher margin services business. R&D will continue to drive new products and AAPL now has over 2 billion installed devices around the world. While near term earnings expectations appear reasonable, we felt it was prudent to reduce the position size based on risks to valuation.”\n\nIs Apple The Best AI Stock Pick of Stanley Druckenmiller?\n\nApple is not the best AI stock pick of billionaire Druckenmiller.\n\nApple ranked 4th in our list of Stanley Druckenmiller's 10 Best AI Stock Picks.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Spent More Buying This Stock Than He Did With Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Occidental Petroleum, Combined!",
        "content": "When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, professional and everyday investors pay close attention. That's because the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as he's come to be known, has handily outpaced the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over nearly six decades.\n\nWhereas the S&P 500 has produced an impressive total return, including dividends, of around 34,200% since the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) that's approaching 5,000,000%! With an outperformance this great, it's no wonder tens of thousands of investors flock to Omaha, Neb., each year to hear Buffett speak about stocks and the U.S. economy.\n\nIt also explains why investors wait on pins and needles for Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filing. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest and most-successful money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThough Berkshire's 13Fs have historically been a gold mine for investors, they don't tell the full story about Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has spent a small fortune on Berkshire's core holdings\n\nWith the preface that I'm writing this up before Berkshire Hathaway files its 13F on Wednesday, May 15, the combination of Berkshire's previous operating reports, 13Fs, and annual letters to shareholders show that Warren Buffett and his investment team have spent a small fortune building up many of their core positions.\n\nBased on admissions by Buffett during his company's latest annual shareholder meeting, he and his top investment aides (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) sold about 13% of their company's leading position in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for tax purposes in the March-ended quarter. This reduced the market value of Berkshire's stake in Apple to an estimated $144.5 billion, as of the closing bell on May 10.\n\nHowever, Buffett and his team are sitting on a massive unrealized gain. According to 13F aggregation website WhaleWisdom.com, Berkshire Hathaway is estimated to have a cost basis of less than $40 in Apple. This suggests Buffett & Co. spent around $31.3 billion to purchase the shares of Apple they currently own.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha and his crew have also spent big bucks building up Berkshire's holdings in two integrated energy companies, Chevron(NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Somewhere in the ballpark of $16 billion and $13 billion have, respectively, been put to work in shares of Chevron and Occidental -- and this doesn't count the $8.5 billion in Occidental Petroleum preferred stock that Berkshire also owns.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpending an aggregate of $29 billion on energy stocks is a pretty clear indication that Berkshire's smartest investment minds expect the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated. Following years of capital underinvestment during the pandemic by energy majors (including Chevron and Occidental), the global supply of crude oil is constrained. With no easy fix in sight, higher spot prices should be beneficial to the high-margin drilling segments of both companies.\n\nWarren Buffett put quite a bit of his company's capital to work when beverage company Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) were added to Berkshire's portfolio in 1988 and 1991, respectively. Based on a previous annual letter to shareholders, Buffett points out that his company's cost basis on Coca-Cola and AmEx is roughly $1.3 billion for each company.\n\nIn his latest annual letter to shareholders, Buffett referred to Coca-Cola and American Express as \"indefinite\" holdings. They're companies with especially strong branding and marketing that benefit from long-winded periods of economic growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWarren Buffett has purchased over $77 billion of his favorite stock since 2018\n\nCollectively, Warren Buffett has put around $63 billion to work in these five core holdings. While that might sound like a lot of money, it's actually dwarfed by the amount of cash he's spent buying shares of his favorite stock over the last six years.\n\nWhat makes this purchasing activity somewhat of a mystery is that it doesn't show up in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13Fs. In order to track the buying activity in Buffett's favorite stock, you'll need to dig into the company's quarterly operating results.\n\nToward the end of each quarterly report, just prior to the executive certifications, you'll find the complete details on share repurchases undertaken during the previous three months. That's right... the company Warren Buffett has spent more money buying shares of than Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Occidental, combined, is Berkshire Hathaway!\n\nBefore the midpoint of July 2018, Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger had their hands tied when it came to share buybacks. Repurchases were only allowed if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above stated book value in the latest quarter). At no point did Berkshire's stock hit this threshold during the 2010s.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's board adopted new measures that allowed Buffett and Munger to get off the proverbial bench and work their magic. Berkshire's board green-lit share buybacks with no ceiling or end date as long as:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and Warren Buffett believes shares are intrinsically cheap.\n\nSince this change was made in July 2018, Warren Buffett has bought back shares of his own company's stock for 23 consecutive quarters. Including the $2.6 billion that was spent on buybacks in the first quarter, the Oracle of Omaha has repurchased over $77 billion of Berkshire's stock in under six years -- $14 billion more than was collectively spent on Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, AmEx, and Occidental Petroleum.\n\nBecause Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, a steady share repurchase program is an easy way for the Oracle of Omaha to reward his long-term shareholders. Consistently buying back stock and reducing the number of shares outstanding is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of long-term investors.\n\nFurthermore, companies with steady or growing net income usually see their earnings per share (EPS) rise as their outstanding share count declines. With Berkshire's cash pile potentially approaching $200 billion this quarter, Buffett has every incentive to continue buying his favorite stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Brace for a Market Crash With These 3 (Surprising) New Inflation Hedges",
        "content": "An inflation hedge protects against currency devaluation caused by rising prices. It involves investing in assets expected to maintain or increase value. Hedging can prevent investment losses due to inflation, which reduces the real return.\n\nFor instance, the real return is negative if a stock yields 5%, but inflation is 6%. Inflation-hedged assets may retain high value despite lower intrinsic worth as investors seek them out.\n\nWhen people talk about their money not stretching as far, they’re referring to inflation affecting their earnings or wealth. Inflation reduces purchasing power, so individuals aim for earnings and investments to outpace it, allowing them to afford more, even with rising prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEach state has its own inflation rate, influenced by its economy and fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation can affect specific areas like gas or food costs and comes in three types: demand-pull, cost-push and built-in inflation.\n\nThat said, here are three new inflation hedges that people are going crazy about.\n\nNvidia Is the New Gold\n\nOne of the most traditional inflation hedges is gold. It has been a top inflation hedge since 1971; during the Great Recession, gold became so popular despite its volatility and short-term uncertainties. Banks believe that having more gold is better, and thus, they bought more of it in 2022 than in 1967.\n\nEven in 2024, inflation is still an ongoing concern, and it has been causing delays in Fed rate cuts. As per Bloomberg, investors are turning to big tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven. However, gold remains the preferred inflation hedge.\n\nIn the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey, respondents viewed significant U.S. tech stocks as a hedge against inflation alongside gold. At the same time, 46% favored gold and nearly a third chose tech giants.\n\nSurvey respondents favored tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as the best hedge against inflation, highlighting their dominant role in the U.S. markets. Their steady profits and growth instill investor confidence in continued gains. Though reduced from 2022 highs, inflation still concerns investors, with 59% citing it as the top market risk. The following CPI reading is anticipated to sit at 3.4% year-over-year.\n\nThree years ago, inflation skyrocketed past 2%, and Nvidia surged six times. Other tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also outperformed the S&P 500 market by 50%. Although, like other tech stocks, they can be sensitive to inflation and changes in inflation rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia marked a milestone and surged over 200%. The stock has exceeded $900 per share. In February, it awed the market through its excellent earnings report. The company showed $22 billion in revenue through generative AI and H100 GPUs. It also helped Nvidia get a seat at the trillion-dollar market cap hierarchy.\n\nInvesting in Farmlands\n\nInstitutional investors historically used agricultural land as an inflation hedge, but it must often be made available to most investors. In 2023, pension funds and tax-exempt vehicles held about 1,331 U.S. farmland properties worth $16.2 billion. Retail investors can access farmland assets through publicly traded REITs like Farmland Partners (NYSE:FPI) and Gladstone Land (NASDAQ:LAND).\n\nFarmland historically performs well during high inflation due to its positive correlation and real asset nature. It correlates more strongly with the CPI and Producer Price Index than other investments. Real assets, including farmland, typically outperform traditional assets during inflation, with nominal value growth. Farmland has seen year-over-year price decreases only once since 1987, indicating value preservation despite inflation.\n\nFarmland scarcity serves as a natural inflation hedge. The United States lost over 11 million acres in 20 years, and could still lead to more acres by 2050. Farmland proved otherwise, as it averaged an 11% annual return from years 1992 through 2020. It appreciates while generating operating cash flow, supported by the constant demand for food.\n\nFarmland is a unique real estate investment that provides stable income and resilience across economic cycles. Moreover, the returns from farmland are not correlated with public markets. That makes them unaffected during economic shifts.\n\nAlthough investing in farmland can be crucial due to decreasing arable land and global population, it is still worth an investment. In fact, regenerative agricultural practices make farmlands look enticing for investors.\n\nPut Up a Chicken Wings Business\n\nChicken is reclaiming its place as a favorite food choice for Americans. With beef prices increasing, people are opting for more chicken wings at fast-food restaurants and frozen tenders at grocery stores. Meat companies like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) and Pilgrim’s Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) are seeing increased profits from poultry due to rising demand and lower costs for livestock feed.\n\nRetail sales of all U.S. chicken products rose by 3% for the year ending April 21, while pork and beef sales slightly declined. With food spending at a three-decade high, consumers opt for cheaper private-label items and cut back on branded purchases. Tyson executives noted shoppers prioritizing essentials over beef and expensive brands, but the duration of this trend remains to be determined.\n\nMoreover, unstable U.S. cattle supply leads meatpackers like Tyson to pay more for livestock, raising wholesale and retail meat prices. Tyson executives noted ranchers still need to begin rebuilding herds. Ground beef retail prices surged approximately 12% in March compared to a year ago, with Tyson’s CEO attributing strong chicken demand to more discerning consumers.\n\nFabio Sandri, CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride, noted a shift to cheaper chicken items on restaurant menus. Despite overall restaurant foot traffic declines, Pilgrim’s fast-food chain sales rose 6% in the latest quarter. Shares in the second-largest chicken processor surged approximately 60% over the past year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInflation decreases purchasing power, limiting what one can buy with the same money. That may lead to borrowing or reduced spending on non-essential items. If one’s income keeps up with inflation, there’s less for investments or discretionary spending.\n\nAdditionally, inflation may trigger a recession by reducing consumer spending and prompting interest rate hikes to curb inflation, slowing borrowing and business activity.\n\nCommon inflation hedges include gold, commodities, a balanced 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio, REITs, rental income, the S&P 500 and TIPS. Or, you may also want to invest more in Nvidia, farmlands or perhaps put up a chicken wing business while it’s cheap.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Quantum Computing Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for May 2024",
        "content": "Quantum computing has the potential to usher in a new era of computing power. While the market is still digesting the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, they have yet to focus in on the next big discovery.\n\nRemarkably, quantum computers have the ability to perform optimization and predictive tasks faster than conventional computers. They do require a load of capital to build and maintain. So only a select few public companies in the market specialize in this field.\n\nAs U.S. equities remain rather volatile, it’s probably best to stay away from small-cap pure-play quantum computing stock. Why? Their ability to generate profits for shareholders is still up in the air. So, let’s examine larger tech companies that have made significant strides in developing quantum computers. And the icing on the cake is, Wall Street is optimistic about all of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for software giant and household name, Google. Having already written about Alphabet stock in the past, I’m still bullish on the company’s share price. It trades at a 21.9x forward earnings, which is lower than competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the tech giant has many tailwinds guiding its rise, including advanced computing technologies.\n\nIn fact, Google has been developing quantum computing technology for well over a decade now. Sycamore is the name of Google’s quantum computer gem. This quantum system has 70 qubits, which is higher than a prior version of the computer. Similar to normal bytes, qubits can be in a state of 0 or 1. However, they can be in these states simultaneously, endowing them with more processing power than a normal computer.\n\nAccording to Koyfin, Google has 59 Wall Street analysts covering its shares, and 48 of them have given the stock a strong buy or buy rating.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nImpressively, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have soared well over 200% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe reason? The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). The chipmaker is the key provider of advanced chips that power large-language models for training AI chatbots. Nvidia’s state-of-the-art Blackwell chips will develop improved AI models for both businesses and consumers. In addition to its lead in AI processing power, Nvidia is paving the way for quantum computers.\n\nFurther, Nvidia has developed an open-source platform dubbed CUDA-Q. It allows quantum computing scientists to program and integrate quantum processing units (QPUs) with classical computing systems like GPUs and CPUs. The influence of Nvidia’s quantum computing platform goes beyond quantum computing systems in the U.S. In fact, national research centers in Germany, Japan and Poland are relying upon Nvidia’s open-source programming system to create their own quantum computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll in all, as AI takes the forefront of the NVDA stock discussion, investors should also consider the chipmaker’s foray into quantum computing.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is another legacy tech business that has dipped more than one toe in the quantum computing space.\n\nIBM has been pursuing quantum computing research since the early 2000s. And the company’s desire to stay at the forefront of research in the field has not abated. Last year, IBM seemed to have extended its lead in quantum computing processors. The release of the Condor system took the market by storm. This quantum processor has 1,121 superconducting qubits, rendering it the largest quantum computing chip that has been developed.\n\nHowever, not all the news is positive. IBM has suffered with sluggish growth over the past few years. The uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment certainly has not helped. Nevertheless, quantum computing could prove to be an important growth lever for the business. IBM trades at 17.0x forward earnings and has received a couple of strong buy ratings from Wall Street firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Some of the most talented, high-ranking workers at Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX jumped ship after return-to-office mandates, new study reveals",
        "content": "The focus of return-to-office discussions have long focused on the individuals. Why might workers prefer to stay home? Which age groups are most amenable to in-person work, and which are most combative? Does office collaboration make the most sense for creative types or heads-down numbers people? Can workers really be productive left to their own devices?\n\nYet the lingering question of how widespread remote work shapes company outcomes, as well as the wider sector landscape, largely remains unanswered because the whole experiment remains in flux. But a new working paper from researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Chicago, titled “Return to Office and the Tenure Distribution,” comes fairly close to positing an answer: Return-to-office (RTO) mandates, when they’re not wanted, are bad news for companies looking to keep their talent.\n\nThe researchers matched 260 million resumes to company data to analyze causal effects of RTO mandates on employees’ tenure at Microsoft, SpaceX, and Apple. In scientific terms, they found “a reduction in counterfactual tenure that increases for employees with longer tenure.” In layman’s terms: When the firms enacted RTO mandates, senior employees headed for the door—often to direct competitors—who let them work from home.\n\nThe number of top-brass employees at Microsoft—as a share of the company headcount—dropped by over 5% post-mandate; at Apple, it was 4%. (Microsoft mandated 50% of the week in-office; Apple, just one day a week.) SpaceX was the worst of the bunch, with a 15% drop, which the researchers chalk up to its uniquely stringent requirement: Five days a week in-person. That human outflow poses an enduring threat to “productivity, innovation, and competitiveness”—the component parts that separate a thriving company from one in freefall.\n\nMicrosoft’s internal data doesn’t align with the paper’s findings, Amy Coleman, its vice president of human resources and corporate functions, told Fortune via email. The term “return to office mandate” is also inaccurate, she said, adding that Microsoft is a hybrid workplace “that revolves around flexibility and a mix of workstyles across worksite, work location and work hours.” In 2022, Microsoft’s chief human resources officer Kathleen Hogan told Fortune the company considers “working from home up to 50% of the time as standard.”\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and SpaceX did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment, though an Apple spokesperson told the Washington Post that the study drew “inaccurate conclusions” and “does not reflect the realities” of Apple’s business or attrition rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe human toll of forcing their hand\n\nThe statistical analysis came from People Data Labs resumé data, David Van Dijcke, a coauthor and University of Michigan economics PhD student, tells Fortune. “The takeaway is definitely that the effects [of RTO mandates] are more deleterious than people thought before.”\n\nGranted, the study is far from all-encompassing; it only studied three major firms, and they were all “early movers” in the RTO push, Van Dijcke acknowledges, pointing to each of their 2022 mandate announcements. That meant senior employees who left Microsoft, Apple, and SpaceX had “pretty good outside options,” namely competing companies that offered remote work with far fewer strings attached.\n\n“If we think of Covid as ending in 2022, that was certainly followed by an influx of people claiming they would leave—and then really leaving when the first return-to-office mandates happened,” Anthony Nyberg, a management professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, tells Fortune. “Apple and Microsoft really agonized over how to change their policies—Amazon, too, made many public comments.”\n\nTo be sure, Nyberg went on, mandating an office return is a major strategic decision—and even in the Michigan study, which found a statistically significant portion of high-earning workers leaving, it remains unclear whether that’s necessarily a bad thing for their former companies. “A big part of this is likely to become a sorting effect in terms of talent finding their best-fit organizations,” Nyberg says. “And people going to competing companies has been a truism for all of eternity.”\n\nPlus, especially within the tech industry, moving to a competitor that’s offering to shell out more money is hardly much to write home about. Particularly if you work remotely, changing jobs is “no more than getting a new laptop shipped to you,” Nyberg says.\n\nIt’s harder at the bottom\n\nA major asterisk to the data that Van Dijcke hopes people understand: Senior people may leave after a RTO more often, and in much greater numbers than entry- or mid-level workers, because senior leaders simply have more to gain. “They’re older, they’re more skilled, companies want to hire them for their expertise,” Van Dijcke says; greener employees don’t command the same sway. “We also saw that employees who leave aren't forced to accept suboptimal jobs—demotions,” he adds.\n\nEarlier literature shows a preference for fully remote jobs is lowest among the youngest employees, who have the most to gain from in-person collaborative work. “That seems to explain the pattern we observed—that senior employees leave at higher rates,” Van Dijcke says. “They have better options, and they also want to work from home more than junior employees do.”\n\nEven so, no RTO mandate should come at the expense of the bottom line, Nyberg stresses. “As soon as an organization can no longer achieve its strategic directives, halt the RTO plan,” he says. “But even during this period, these organizations keep enacting layoffs, which certainly suggests they’re not in a people shortage yet. And layoffs are much more dangerous, broadly speaking.”\n\nIndeed, layoffs, especially across Big Tech, often have long-term lagging effects, making workers likelier to leave due to disrupted culture and fractured trust. But mandates are pushing people out, too; poor morale might just be poor morale. (Ninety-nine percent of companies found a drop in employee satisfaction following their RTO mandate issuance, per a recent University of Pittsburgh study.)\n\nMany experts see the whole decision simply. “An organization is really hurting itself if it forces people to come back,” Stephan Meier, chair of the Management Division at Columbia Business School, tells Fortune, adding he personally thinks the future will be hybrid. “People are really motivated by having flexibility in how they organize their days. But a lot of leaders grew up in an in-office environment—that was their way to control employees, that’s how they thought the world worked, that’s what worked for them and it’s why they’re on top.”\n\nMandates, for the most part, miss the point; workers will come back on their own accord if they feel doing so would bring a material benefit—or make it easier to deliver on their own work objectives.\n\nNonetheless, if a company is hellbent on having full offices—even if that can only be accomplished by force—Meier says “now is probably a better time [to enact a mandate] than two years ago,” owing to the pressure of mass layoffs and dire economic uncertainty. But companies that roll out mandates, he stresses, are missing the point.\n\n“Being a leader means finding something that benefits everyone, and makes the firm run better,” Meier says. And fears of depressed financial outcomes stemming from remote work are far overblown; underperformers existed long before the pandemic, and no change in work arrangements will necessarily create more of them. “Before quiet quitting, there was Microsoft solitaire—a different way of phoning it in,” Meier says.\n\nAll told, the findings in the report don’t seem too egregious to Nyberg, the South Carolina professor, who’s spent decades—through financial crises and boom periods—assessing the flow of human capital. “But then again, I’m old.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Confirms Apple Sale, Dumps This PC Maker, Finally Reveals Mystery Stock: Here Are The Portfolio Changes To Know\n\nInvestment guru Warren Buffett confirmed Wednesday the trimming of his Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake and finally shed light on the mystery stock his firm, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), accumulated ahead of the first quarter.\n\nApple, Chevron Trimmed: Berkshire reduced its Apple position by a little over 116 million.\n\nThe firm now owns 789,368,450 Apple shares valued at $135.36 billion, a 13F filing shows. This is the second straight quarter that the Buffett-led company has diluted its Apple stake.\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer remains Berkshire’s top holding.\n\nEarlier this month, Buffett — at the annual Berkshire shareholder meeting — said the dilution has to do with footing the tax bill and the desire to hold more cash due to economic uncertainties.\n\nAfter adding 15.9 million Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) shares in the fourth quarter, the firm sold 3.1 million shares of the oil giant in the first quarter. The latest 13F showed Berkshire owning 112.98 million shares worth $305.70 million.\n\nBut Berkshire added 4.32 million shares of  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY), with its latest stake amounting to 248.02 million.\n\nBerkshire maintained its stake in its other three core holdings:\n\nBank of America, Inc. (NYSE:BAC): 1.03 million shares valued at $39.17 billion American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP): 151.61 million shares valued at $34.52 billion Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO): 400 million shares valued at $24.47 billion\n\nSee Also: Best Growth Stocks Right Now\n\nMystery Stock Unveiled: Berkshire also finally disclosed the mystery stock it sounded out earlier. The firm bought a big chunk of Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) shares.\n\nBerkshire accumulated 25.92 million shares of the property and casualty insurer at a valuation of $6.72 billion. This stake gives Berkshire a 6.4% stake in the insurer (based on 406 million in outstanding shares).\n\nInsurance has been a staple sector in Berkshire’s portfolio. Other holdings include auto insurer GEICO, reinsurance company General Re and Alleghany Corporation, a holding company of property and casualty reinsurance and insurance operating subsidiaries.\n\nHP Stake Jettisoned: Berkshire cashed out of HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) in the first quarter. The firm sold all the 22.85 million shares (worth $687.64 million) of the computer and peripherals maker it held at the fourth quarter.\n\nOther Disposals: Among the other portfolio stocks, the firm part disposed include:\n\nCurrent Position\r\n(number of shares) Q-o-Q Change Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) 6.60M -6.34% Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) 7.53M -88.11% Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI) 36.68M -8.85%\n\nAt the shareholder meeting, Buffett previewed the Paramount Global sale and took the responsibility for zeroing in on the investment.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It was 100% my decision, and we’ve sold it all, and we lost quite a bit of money,” he said.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Class A shares were little changed at $413.01 in premarket trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nNow Read: Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Q1 Shake-Up: Home Retailer Dumped, Hot Restaurant Stake Trimmed And A ‘Magnificent 7’ Holding Juggled\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Warren Buffett's Berkshire Confirms Apple Sale, Dumps This PC Maker, Finally Reveals Mystery Stock: Here Are The Portfolio Changes To Know originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Samsung gleefully joined this month’s Apple pile-on, unveiling a new ad for a Galaxy tablet that mocks its rival for a rare marketing misstep.\n\nThe 43-second spot released on social media shows a young woman navigating through assorted debris strewn on the floor before stopping at a broken guitar she picks up.\n\nStudying sheet music displayed on her Galaxy Tab S9, she begins strumming a few chords, not caring that the damaged instrument is out of tune.\n\n“Creativity cannot be crushed,” ran the Samsung ad in a clear dig at its competitor in Cupertino still reeling from a badly conceived advertisement.\n\nWe would never crush creativity. #UnCrushpic.twitter.com/qvlUqbRlnE\n\n— Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) May 15, 2024\n\nIn a world where machines could soon prove superior to their creators, Apple thought the best metaphor when selling its first new iPad Pro in nearly two years was a giant hydraulic press figuratively and literally crushing creative tools humanity has relied on for centuries into one ultra-thin Apple tablet—all to a cheerful Sonny and Cher melody.\n\n“Just think of all the things it’ll be used to create,” posted a giddy Tim Cook, only to be inundated with 19,000 replies of overwhelmingly angry consumers.\n\nStorm prompts rare Apple apology\n\nPeople like actor Hugh Grant came away from viewing the ad disgusted at what was viewed as a vulgar and obscene display of Silicon Valley techno-fetishism personally endorsed by Steve Jobs' anointed successor as CEO, Tim Cook.\n\n“Steve wouldn’t have shipped that ad,” wrote Paul Graham, who founded startup accelerator Y Combinator. “It would have pained him too much to watch.”\n\nThe destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley. https://t.co/273XB3CfnF\n\n— Hugh Grant (@HackedOffHugh) May 8, 2024\n\nThe backlash against its Crush! spot prompted Apple, a company that otherwise has long enjoyed a reputation for savvy ads that speak to the zeitgeist, to issue a rare apology.\n\n“We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry,” Tor Myhren, vice president of marketing, told trade publication Ad Age last week.\n\nIn 2023, Apple ended Samsung’s 12-year run as the largest smartphone provider in the world. However, weakness in China allowed the South Korean giant to reclaim the top spot in the first quarter of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat victory didn’t stop it from twisting the proverbial knife, however.\n\nWith Apple on the ropes over its poorly conceived ad, Samsung is currently trying to get the hashtag #UnCrush to trend on social media.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google, Apple, and Microsoft make their products friendlier to users with disabilities",
        "content": "It’s Global Accessibility Awareness Day today, and Big Tech firms have accordingly issued a flurry of announcements about how they’ll make their products friendlier to people whose use of devices is hindered by disabilities.\n\nMost coverage of Google’s I/O developer event this week may have focused on its generative AI news, but the company also announced an expansion of Project Gameface to the Android platform. Google announced that project last year—it’s an open-source, hands-free gaming “mouse” that uses the webcam to capture the gamer’s head movements and facial gestures, translating them into cursor movements via the magic of machine learning. Now Google is open-sourcing more of the code so developers can make better Android accessibility apps.\n\nGaming may have been the inspiration for Project Gameface—specifically, the needs of a gaming streamer named Lance Carr, who has muscular dystrophy—but the applications clearly go far beyond, with Google promising use cases in educational and work settings too.\n\nIn a similar vein, Apple yesterday also announced an upcoming iPhone and iPad feature called Eye Tracking. This does what the name suggests, giving users a way to navigate through and activate the elements of an app, just by letting the front-facing camera track their eye movements.\n\nApple also revealed other accessibility features that will be coming soon: Music Haptics, which will help deaf or hard-of-hearing iPhone users experience music with the aid of “taps, textures, and refined vibrations”; Vocal Shortcuts, which will let users trigger complex tasks by uttering simple sounds; and a bunch of new accessibility features specific to the CarPlay and visionOS environments.\n\nMeanwhile, on the intriguing-hardware front, we have Microsoft’s announcement yesterday of the Proteus controller for Xbox and PC gamers.\n\nDesigned by peripherals startup ByoWave, the Proteus is a kit comprising “snap and play” parts that let people customize a wireless controller according to their needs. There’s a “mother cube” that serves as the controller’s brain, a cube features the directional pad, a piece with a mini control stick, another two providing left and right triggers, and so on. There are many possible configurations, from traditional controller layouts to wand-like columns and tabletop-friendly rectangles. Preorders are open now, with the kit ($255 to first-comers, $299 thereafter) shipping in the fall.\n\nMicrosoft also used the occasion of Global Accessibility Awareness Day to promise fixes for what some gamers with disabilities experienced from a major change that the company made last November when it started blocking the use of unauthorized accessories with the Xbox console. This has been an issue for those who had put together custom controller setups to fit their unique requirements, with equipment coming from small specialist manufacturers that aren’t official Microsoft licensees.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of Microsoft’s solution is for those manufacturers to get in touch and make their controllers official, but the company is also updating its own Adaptive Controller, which the Xbox always accepts, to expand support for more accessories. The $99 Adaptive Controller is a clever piece of gear that includes some built-in controller functionality of its own, but more importantly acts as a hub for specialized equipment, such as switches that are controlled by biting, sipping, and puffing with the mouth, or with one's feet.\n\n“We appreciate and acknowledge that gaming with a disability is highly individualistic, and the solution for one may not be the solution for all,” the company said.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Shares Are Back to Winning Ways as AI Optimism Builds",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After months of struggles, Apple Inc. is looking a lot more like the stock market leader it used to be.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US ‘Containment’ Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market\n\nThe iPhone maker’s shares are on pace for their best month since March 2023. They’ve gained more than 11% after a strong earnings report showed growth is returning and the company also announced the biggest stock buyback in US history, a sign of its financial might.\n\nIn addition, there is growing excitement about its artificial intelligence plans. After being down as much as 14% this year, the stock is close to erasing those losses.\n\nThe latest leg of the rally came after a Bloomberg report that Apple is closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use ChatGPT features in the new iPhone operating system. That had greater resonance after OpenAI on Monday showed off a faster and cheaper version of the AI model that underpins ChatGPT, including a demonstration of new voice features.\n\nThe demo showed the potential for AI-infused digital assistants, and such features could juice revenue growth for Apple by compelling customers to buy new iPhones and pay for more services, according to Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management. He’s more convinced than ever that “AI will result in Siri on steroids,” he said.\n\n“A lot of the details of Apple’s AI strategy are still under wraps, but I think AI will produce a huge upgrade cycle, one of the biggest it has seen in some time,” said Mahoney.\n\nAn agreement with OpenAI is not yet official, and Apple also has held talks with Alphabet Inc. to build Google’s Gemini AI engine into the iPhone. Those talks are ongoing, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nGoogle unveiled new AI features of its own this week, in a demonstration that was seen as a positive sign of its own technological capabilities. Investors suggested a partnership with either could be positive for Apple.\n\nRead More: Google Introduces Generative AI in Search in Major Update\n\n“It doesn’t need to build things from the ground up, or make a huge investment in AI just to bring something to market,” Mahoney said. “Other companies have already done that work, and they’re all going to want to be on the iPhone.”\n\nA key event for Apple will come at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The company is expected to show off its next major software updates for the iPhone and other devices, where its new AI strategy will be front and center, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has been dogged this year by concerns about stagnating revenue growth amid sluggish sales of iPhones and weakness in China. Revenue fell 4% in Apple’s fiscal second quarter, the fifth contraction in the past six quarters. However, the Cupertino, California-based company projected that sales would increase by a percentage in the low single digits, raising hopes about future expansion.\n\nOf course, there’s still a lot of uncertainty, and at 27 times estimated earnings, Apple remains above its long-term average multiple at a time of tepid growth.\n\n“If Apple can’t recapture growth, then it is probably a bit expensive,” said Ryan Gorman, an independent analyst who was previously chief investment officer at Callesen Wealth Management.\n\n“A deal with either OpenAI or Alphabet would show that Apple is taking AI seriously,” he added. AI is “a feature you have to have to remain relevant, but does it really drive profits and revenue going forward? That remains to be seen.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTop Tech News\n\nMichael Burry’s investment firm doubled down on its bets on JD.com Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in the first quarter as Chinese equities bottomed out. When Microsoft Corp. pledged four years ago to remove more carbon than it emits by the end of the decade, it was one of the most ambitious and comprehensive plans to tackle climate change. Now the software giant’s relentless push to be the global leader in artificial intelligence is putting that goal in peril. Five years after Amazon.com Inc. raised wages to $15 an hour, half of warehouse workers surveyed by researchers say they struggle to afford enough food or a place to live. Baidu Inc.’s revenue grew at the slowest pace in more than a year, as China’s flagging economy put pressure on its core advertising business. ServiceNow Inc. has increased its workforce and expanded in enterprise software using a simple strategy: hire from its larger competitor, Salesforce Inc.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nLightspeed Commerce Inc Postmarket\n\nApplied Materials Globant DXC Technology\n\n--With assistance from Sarah Zheng and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives The DNA Test Delusion Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do Neuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warren Buffett's Q1'2024 stock holdings data is out and the market is inundated with excitement around the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock picks. But unlike many other hedge funds which are fickle and revisit their investments regularly, Buffett believes in buying stocks and then holding on to them for decades.\n\nBuffett's \"Mystery Stock Pick\" Revealed\n\nBut over the past several months the market remained guessing the name of the \"mystery stock\" in Warren Buffett's portfolio he hadn’t revealed. Berkshire had requested SEC for confidentiality as it was busy buying large stakes in the company. Some said it would be Alphabet, some speculated it would be a Chinese stock (Alibaba was the favorite candidate). But many wise investors said the would be from the insurance and finance industry as Buffett has time and again indicated his preference for companies that are doing what he knows the best: insurance, banks, finance.\n\nFinally, Berkshire has revealed this mystery stock pick and it's part of our detailed list of Top 7 Favorite Stocks of Warren Buffett for 2024.\n\nWhy Isn't Buffett Deploying His Cash Reserves?\n\nAt the latest annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett revealed that is firm's cash piles had swelled to about $189 billion at the end of the first quarter, with him expecting the kitty to hit $200 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2024. This begs the question: why isn’t Buffett deploying this cash? After all he was the one who once said:\n\n“Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn't. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value.\"\n\n\"No Possibility of Eye-Popping\" Gains?\n\nBuffett's reasoning is simple: he only invests when he finds attractive deals with \"eye-popping\" returns, and the market today just isn’t presenting him with any worthy opportunities. In his 2023 investor letter, Buffett went as far as to say that he sees \"no possibility of eye-popping performance\" in the current environment.\n\nBuffett always sticks to his core investing principle: never invest in overvalued equities. In his latest investor letter he reiterated that for him to invest in companies, they have to be \"attractively priced.\" Warren Buffett's Top Stock Picks 2024\n\nThe Size Factor\n\nAnother reason Berkshire isn’t deploying cash is its size and Buffett's inclination towards investing only for significant gains.\n\n\"Those days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases was also a factor. Berkshire now has – by far – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American business.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this article we will take a look at the top three stock picks of Warren Buffett by analyzing his Q1'2024 portfolio. To see more stocks that are top favorites of Warren Buffett, including his mystery stock, click Warren Buffett's 7 Top Favorite Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nAmerican Express Co (NYSE:AXP)\n\nWarren Buffett's Q1 2024 Stake: $34,520,240,283\n\nWarren Buffett has not touched his gigantic stake in American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) since 2013, which shows the trust Oracle of Omaha has in the business, which he called “hugely successful” in his 2023 letter to Berkshire shareholders, adding:\n\n“The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.”\n\nAmerican Express Co (NYSE:AXP) accounted for about 10% of the total Berkshire portfolio in the first quarter of 2024 as the fund has a $34.5 billion stake in American Express Co (NYSE:AXP).\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our top performers this quarter were American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Expedia and Axalta. American Express saw a 26% share price gain. The business has performed well over the past year and over our holding period. While American Express’ long-term growth and attractive business model is well known and understood, the shares had been flat to down for most of the year on fears of a recession. In a recessionary environment, consumer spending slows, which impacts revenue, and credit costs go up as consumers have a harder time paying their bills. As fears about a recession receded in Q4, investors bid up American Express shares.”\n\nBank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)\n\nWarren Buffett's Q1 2024 Stake: $39,165,748,068\n\nBank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is the second top favorite stock of Warren Buffett. The billionaire has been owning stakes in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) since the third quarter of 2017, when he bought about 69 million shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). As of the end of Q1'2024, this stake has swelled to over 1 billion shares.\n\nWolfe Research’s Steven Chubak, who had downgraded Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) back in October 2021, recently turned bullish on the banking giant, upgrading the stock to Outperform from Peer Perform. Chubak thinks Bank of America Corp's (NYSE:BAC) Q1 results show “better asset repricing trends” and he sees Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) approaching “the point of NII inflection where 'under-earning' banks including both BAC and SCHW [Charles Schwab] should post stronger gains following multiple years of underperformance.”\n\nSequoia Fund stated the following regarding Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Exits last year included Netflix, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and Micron. As discussed in our Q1 shareholder letter, we exited our investment in Bank of America soon after making it, as our thesis was quickly undermined by the regional banking crisis and the regulatory developments that it catalyzed. We think both Bank of America and Micron were purchased at conservative prices given the facts at hand, but the facts changed and we moved on.”\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett's Q1 2024 Stake:$135,360,901,805\n\nBuffett’s relationship with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently the topic of market chatter as the Oracle of Omaha cut his stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) by 13%. History shows that when Buffett isn’t happy with a company, he slowly begins to slash stakes in it, ultimately removing it from its portfolio. Buffett cutting stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) got more attention as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) faces growth challenges in iPhone sales and faces market criticism amid lack of AI catalysts.\n\n“No” was Warren Buffett’s short answer to a question asking him whether he believed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment was losing shine during Berkshire’s latest annual meeting.\n\nBuffett also added that it’s “extremely likely” that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) would be Berkshire’s “largest holding” by the end of 2024.\n\nThat means Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the top favorite stock of Warren Buffett, for now. But it’s also a subtle nudge to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) management to do something about the growth problem before it loses the trust of Berkshire.\n\nThe London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Reduced: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Reduction reflects strong performance in 2023 and resulting elevated valuation. We believe the outlook for AAPL remains strong with slow growth in iPhone (now #1 global market share) and faster growth in the higher margin services business. R&D will continue to drive new products and AAPL now has over 2 billion installed devices around the world. While near term earnings expectations appear reasonable, we felt it was prudent to reduce the position size based on risks to valuation.”\n\nThese were just 3 of the Top Favorite Stocks of Warren Buffett.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 7 More Top Favorite Stocks of Warren Buffett for 2024 [including Buffett's Mystery Stock Pick]\n\nView comments",

        "content": "They say the best time to invest was 20 years ago. And indeed, that’s not too long after the early 2000s recession bottomed out. You’d be sitting on 377% in gains if you invested in the overall market exactly 20 years back. But the second best time? Many would say the COVID trough, but I’d argue that it’s right now, if you know where to look.\n\nThe investing landscape right now may be better than many think, for those looking for buy-and-hold opportunities in the market. Things are surely more fast-paced these days, but 20 years gives you the chance to make the most out of what is likely to come in the future. You’d have known 20 years back that the internet was going to be very big. Accordingly, we have a lot of promising tech that can be big in the next two decades—but we’ll be investing in them indirectly through big ‘no-brainer’ stocks to buy and hold, instead of startups that could fizzle away.\n\nThus, without further ado, here are the seven stocks I’d put my money into if I were handed a crisp $10,000 bill (they actually exist – look it up)!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust when it seemed like Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) influence in the cloud sector couldn’t expand any further, the company surpassed expectations once again. Azure revenue soared 23% this past quarter to eclipse $35.1 billion. And it’s worth noting that arguably the entire AI revolution up until now has been indirectly orchestrated by Microsoft. OpenAI would not be where it is right now without the billions it got from Microsoft. From foundational infrastructure to cutting-edge large language models, Microsoft is clearly leading the way.\n\nThe data boom doesn’t seem to be cooling down either. Azure’s deals valued at more than $100 million increased by over 80%, while commitments over $10 million more than doubled year-over-year.\n\nIt’s estimated that 65% of Fortune 500 companies are now using Azure and/or OpenAI. Yes, MSFT stock trades at 35-times forward earnings and a tech selloff means this stock would likely decline as well. But this is a solid pick if you are holding for 20 years. I have full trust in CEO Satya Nadella, so this is definitely one of the best long-term stocks to buy and hold, in my opinion.

Most semiconductor companies supply directly from Taiwan Semi. Many analysts think the stock deserves to trade lower than its fabless peers due to the “China threat” and on-shoring trends. However, this argument does not make sense to me since any impact on Taiwan Semi would surely hit fabless semiconductor companies much harder. Plus, Taiwan Semi is investing $40 billion in U.S. chip manufacturing. Its facility is expected to be operational in 2027 or 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s financial metrics remain robust. Gross margins exceeded 53% while operating margins topped 42%. Revenue rose 16.5% year-over-year, beating estimates on both earnings and revenue. I see more upside ahead, since the premium you’re paying now is historically not that high. TSM PE. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile seasonal effects dampened smartphone demand slightly in the first quarter, TSMC has done well across all areas of its business. Advanced technological nodes remain in high demand, with 3nm and 5nm processors already accounting for a sizable 46% of wafer sales. Barring unexpected disruptions, this chip giant appears well-situated to sustain its major role in the industry. Notably, TSM stock also provides a 1.7% dividend yield. So, if you like income and you want semiconductor exposure, this is one of the top stocks to buy and hold.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nIt’s hard to ever be bearish on Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). This company has historically outperformed the S&P 500, and I think it is well-positioned to continue doing so. CEO Warren Buffett might be old right now and not have a right-hand man anymore. But even then, this company’s portfolio is very solid.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway partially acts like an ETF, but with massive flexibility. The company can pile cash or other assets into big private companies like BNSF Railway, taking on such investment over the years. Its biggest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has not performed well compared to other Big Tech companies, but it hasn’t delivered terrible results either.\n\nI think once Apple gets its AI game on point, we should see even more bullishness spill over into Berkshire stock.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) An image showing the front of the Google Headquarters in California.\n\nSource: turtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) most recent quarterly results were very encouraging. Revenue increased 15.4% year-over-year, totaling over $80.5 billion. This continues to show the company’s leading position in internet search as well as video sharing through YouTube. Revenue is also up significantly in the company’s cloud computing business. GOOG revenue. stocks to buy and hold\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI really can’t see Google ever being dethroned. AI has not made a dent in Google’s search segment, and YouTube seems even stronger to me. You can make an alternative to Google, but you can’t replace the massive amount of content on YouTube.\n\nYouTube and cloud computing revenue combined are on track to exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the year, if current growth continues. Each of the company’s major business lines showed robust expansion. YouTube has restrictions on adblockers now which is helping power revenue higher. The company also beat both top and bottom-line estimates, a trend I expect to continue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) 2 Billionaires who Could Push Jeff Bezos Out of Top Spot\n\nSource: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently reported another stellar quarterly performance. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, comfortably surpassing Wall Street projections. But an even bigger highlight was its operating income, which rebounded 221% to $15.3 billion. It seems all of Amazon’s ongoing efforts to streamline operations and cut costs are paying off. I believe the stock can continue climbing if the stock’s premium holds up. AMZN EPS. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nInvestments in new fulfillment centers in more local regions are proving valuable, with nearly 60% of Prime orders in major U.S. metropolitan areas now arriving either the same day or the next day. Plus, with $48.8 billion in free cash flow over the last twelve months, I see a lot more room for expansion. Amazon is much more than an e-commerce business after the cloud boom, so I have solid conviction in this diversified business for the next two decades.\n\nIBM (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe market’s reaction to Big Blue’s numbers last quarter was a little puzzling to me. While their revenue came in just a smidge below estimates, I’d say the company’s performance was rock solid across some key areas that matter a lot more. The current pullback is likely due to investors taking profits instead of concerns about IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) core business.\n\nIBM has been turning the corner, and is now quickly shifting from a mature tech cash cow to a cloud + quantum computing and software play. IBM segments. stocks to buy and hold\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFew on Wall Street might now associate IBM with cutting-edge tech yet, but I think that dynamic may change. The HashiCorp acquisition is going to accelerate the process.\n\nIBM is doubling down on its hybrid multi-approach. And since Hashi’s Terraform is the number one tool buildings use for their infrastructure codes, IBM’s getting a great way to help more businesses get started. I think the company’s recent move to link up with Red Hat makes a lot of sense too. Indeed, this deal makes IBM’s entire IT assistance collection stronger.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) CRISPR (CRSP) logo within a DNA sequence\n\nSource: Catalin Rusnac/ShutterStock.com\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is by far the riskiest play on this list. If you’ve been reading my articles for a long time, you’d know I stay away from most biotech companies.\n\nHowever, CRISPR has been one of the rare exceptions. I’ve been bullish on the stock since 2022. CRSP stock hasn’t made big moves either way since, but if this gene-editing tech does become successful, you’ll be laughing your way to the bank in 20 years.\n\nThe company currently has seven trials underway studying new treatments for cancer, autoimmune conditions, heart health issues, and diabetes. The company’s tech can solve a lot more problems than just these.\n\nThe big reason why I’m bullish on this stock is the company’s $2.1 billion cash buffer. I’m confident this cash can last for many years into the future. Analysts seem bullish on CRSP stock over the near-term, too.

        "title": "Shiny Apple? 3 Reasons to Buy and Hold AAPL Stock Forever.",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a 5% decline in 2024, with shares of AAPL stock trading roughly flat on a year-to-date basis. Now, much of this performance has to do with Apple’s recent surge, with the stock dropping more than 15% peak to trough during this year’s decline.\n\nThere are ample reasons for investor pessimism towards Apple currently. The company has refreshed some product lines, but it’s uncertain if consumers will feel the need to buy the new iPhone. Negative growth in recent quarters may deter value investors from trading this stock, which is priced at nearly 30-times earnings.\n\nThat said, there’s a reason Apple remains a top tech stock investors continue to pile into. The company’s $110 billion share buyback plan boosted stock last week, signaling confidence despite the premium valuation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s dive into a few other reasons investors remain bulled up on this megacap tech name.\n\nOpenAI and AAPL Stock\n\nApple appears to be nearing a deal with OpenAI for its iPhone AI technology, causing AAPL stock to rise Monday. Apple aims to integrate this technology into iOS 18, details of which will be unveiled at WWDC starting June 10.\n\nBloomberg reported Friday that Apple finalized terms to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT into iOS 18. Apple also discussed licensing Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google’s Gemini AI chatbot. CEO Tim Cook also noted the company’s transformative AI plans during its May 2 conference call.\n\nWedbush Securities’ Daniel Ives noted adding AI to the iPhone 16 series could drive upgrades. He suggested Apple might monetize AI services through subscriptions, leveraging its vast hardware user base.\n\nIves anticipated Apple enhancing Siri with OpenAI for complex tasks, potentially as a separate subscription service.\n\nApple Quartiles\n\nApple News+ also introduced Quartiles, a new original spelling game, and Offline Mode for subscribers without Wi-Fi or cellular. Available with iOS 17.5, these enhance the News+ experience. Editor-in-chief Lauren Kern highlighted the additions’ convenience and entertainment value.\n\nQuartiles challenges players to create words from tiles with 2 to 4 letters, earning points based on word length. New puzzles are offered daily, and users can share puzzles with other subscribers.\n\nIt’s the latest addition to News+’s Puzzles collection. With iOS 17, Apple introduced daily crosswords and mini puzzles for U.S. and Canadian subscribers. A new Puzzles Scoreboard allows subscribers to view personalized stats and streaks.\n\nPossible Partnership with Rivian\n\nOn May 6, reports suggested Apple was exploring a partnership, with EV company Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) emerging as a top candidate. Although details remain speculative, a collaboration could significantly benefit both companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple invested $10 billion over a decade in its EV project but scrapped it in early 2024 after multiple failed attempts. With cars becoming advanced computers, Apple sees a chance to diversify its ecosystem and enter the automotive space by partnering with Rivian.\n\nRivian, struggling financially and losing over $38,000 per car, could benefit from Apple’s brand recognition and expertise, potentially opening new opportunities in the competitive EV market.\n\nA Rivian-Apple collaboration could focus on joint R&D in autonomous driving technology. Rivian’s Driver+ software, requiring driver attention, could benefit from Apple’s financial and technological resources, accelerating progress toward Level 4 or 5 autonomy.\n\nRivian has the hardware and infrastructure for vehicle production, while Apple could develop the software, making their partnership highly complementary.\n\nAAPL Stock Isn’t Cheap, But for a Reason\n\nApple’s quarterly results highlighted a historic buyback and sluggish iPhone sales, especially in China. Despite economic challenges and competition, Cook remains optimistic.\n\nWhile the iPhone faces competition in China, innovations could lead to a resurgence. Overall, Apple’s solid quarter suggests potential for stock growth.\n\nI think long-term investors who have owned AAPL stock forever may simply want to continue holding. While the stock’s valuation is excessive, it’s also true that this is a company that’s worth the premium.\n\nOn a capital return basis alone, Apple certainly remains one of the best companies in the world. I don’t think that will change over the next decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "7 Cheap Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The rest of 2024 could be a breakout period for cheap Russell 2000 stocks. Thus far, the index posted a 3.6% gain since January, though it lags the S&P 500’s 10% bump. However, incoming tides might favor small-caps, setting the stage for a record run among cheap Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nInvestors are increasingly wary that investing in a large-cap index like the S&P 500 overexposes them to a few high-performing stocks that skew total returns. This concern is valid, as the “Magnificent 7” stocks make up nearly 30% of the overall index and, until recently, accounted for most of its gains compared to the relatively flat performance of the other 493 stocks. While the rest of the index catches up, investors still face company and sector-specific risks by holding concentrated tech positions in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and the other top S&P 500 stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, potential rate cuts or at least a prolonged pause could benefit small-caps needing growth capital. High debt costs have hindered small-cap borrowing, and investor cash not allocated to mega-caps has largely remained in money market funds. Although investors are gradually returning to stocks, nearly $6 trillion still sits in these funds. This dynamic created a vicious cycle for small-caps, struggling to attract investor interest compared to an attractive 5% (or more) fixed-income yield through money market accounts, high-yield savings, and bond ETFs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, this situation is changing, and these seven cheap Russell 2000 stocks stand to benefit the most.\n\nValley National Bancorp (VLY) A pink piggy bank sitting on three stacked textbooks with a green chalkboard in the background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs Fed rate cuts slowly take effect, banking stocks will move in one of two directions. Companies with limited debt or sufficient size to manage it, such as legacy mega-banks, will likely see their shares decline as net interest income dries up. Conversely, smaller regional banks with higher relative leverage and local real estate lending operations will benefit from lower borrowing rates and increasing consumer loan interest. Among these regional banks, Valley National Bancorp (NASDAQ:VLY) stands out as a particularly cheap Russell 2000 stock.\n\nValley National’s stock trades at a low 0.6x book value and 8x earnings, making it undervalued and inarguably cheap. Its strong balance sheet and low debt load, reflected in a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.56 compared to the industry average of 1.2, demonstrate the bank’s lower leverage relative to competitors. The bank’s recent stock buyback initiative and a 5.7% trailing dividend yield further underscore its financial health.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts widely agree that Valley National is undervalued. Consensus estimates assign an average price target of $9.44, about 20% above its current share price. In addition to this bullish outlook, sentiment around the bank’s stock is improving, with around half of analysts now recommending a “hold,” a significant increase from the 50% who advised selling in the previous evaluation period.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Duolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is a hidden gem in the education tech sector. Despite its shares more than doubling last year, it’s dipped 16% since January and 27% in the past week. However, given its strengths, the current dip presents a buying opportunity. Initially, there were doubts about the commercial viability of its mobile language learning apps. Still, Duolingo is proving its viability as an EdTech stock and a (relatively) cheap Russell 2000 stock contender.\n\nThe key to its success lies in its popularity among customers. Several factors contribute to its widespread appeal, including the increasing reliance on smartphones, the effectiveness of self-directed learning, engaging gamification elements, and lingering post-pandemic habits.\n\nDuolingo’s latest earnings report showed a 5447 year-over-year surge in subscription rates, generating $161 million for the quarter. The number of paid subscribers rose to 7.4 million, marking a 54% year-over-year increase. Building on this success, Duolingo recently announced plans to expand its educational offerings to include music and math lessons.\n\nAlthough some argue that Duolingo’s market valuation is too high, similar criticisms were once directed at Nvidia. With virtually no rivals matching its position, Duolingo is well-positioned to maintain its dominance into 2024 — this cheap Russell 2000 stock won’t remain so for long.\n\nUFP Industries (UFPI) Wooden planks stacked in a warehouse\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUFP Industries (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a lumber supply company that supports housing manufacturers. This cheap Russell 2000 stock stands to benefit from real estate trends rapidly changing as markets reach a “new normal” paradigm of higher-for-longer.\n\nAfter a significant slump throughout 2022 and most of 2023, new housing starts are stabilizing. This continued expansion indicates renewed enthusiasm for new builds in a still-hot real estate market. Although existing home prices stagnated and fell, developers seized the opportunity to attract middle-market homebuyers by offering new homes priced below market estimates and providing attractive financing deals to counter high mortgage rates.\n\nThis strategic move boosts UFP’s lumber supply operation. Additionally, the company’s solid fundamentals distinguish it from competitors. With a price-to-sales ratio of 1, investor enthusiasm is well-aligned with practical revenue targets. UFP’s cash flow is strong, with $788 million in free cash flow over the past 12 months. The company is also virtually debt-free, maintaining a healthy cash and net asset balance. These robust fundamentals position UFP to capitalize on evolving trends while providing a cushion against economic downturns or industry supply chain shocks, even as rate cut prospects remain uncertain.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Fabrinet (FN) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nThough often overlooked, Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) is becoming a key player among cheap Russell 2000 stocks, riding the artificial intelligence wave but sufficiently differentiated to avoid major competitive action. As a major upstream supplier for leading firms like Nvidia, it provides essential components for modern technology. Fabrinet’s product range is broad, but its fiber optic cable segment is the cheap Russell 2000 stock’s shining star.\n\nThe company produces cutting-edge, ultra-high-speed fiber optic cables that enable rapid communication between computers and hardware systems at speeds exceeding 800 GB per second. These cables facilitate swift, large-scale data transfers for AI-focused firms like Nvidia but also serve cloud computing and generalized data storage and management purposes. This segment of Fabrinet’s business currently generates about $500 million in revenue, with projections indicating a potential doubling of operational income in the coming years.\n\nShares surged recently, hitting a 22% gain since January and 150% over the past year. That momentum seems to be continuing, making it one of the best Russell 2000 stocks poised to capture steady-state AI sector growth.\n\nLattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. semiconductor stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a prominent semiconductor company focusing on various “big data” computing solutions, including edge and cloud computing. Its core products also span across consumer electronics like televisions and laptops, ensuring its market penetration and staying power. Recent financials indicate strength for this often-overlooked semiconductor company and cheap Russell 2000 stock.\n\nIn April’s earnings report, Lattice boosted its financial standing slightly, which “Came in as expected [reflecting] the near-term impact of cyclic industry headwinds,” according to CEO Jim Anderson. Revenue dropped by 20% year-over-year, and the company adapted to cost-cutting initiatives while roughly maintaining its gross margin. Net income dropped, too, though the company still posted an 11-cent EPS. Despite the ambivalent news, shares dipped by about 4%, which seems reasonable considering the headwinds Anderson referenced.\n\nOne reason is a slight slowdown in demand. Enthusiasm for general-purpose artificial intelligence seems to have peaked, and consumers are cutting spending. This indicates that firms with an AI advantage have enough computing power to sustain them for the foreseeable future.\n\nSimultaneously, slowing consumer sentiment means Lattice’s peripheral products, like televisions, are not selling as expected. However, apparent shifts in consumer sentiment could reverse this trend. Lattice’s strong financial position allows it to withstand periods of flat sales growth, while its expansive portfolio ensures longevity in a competitive industry.\n\nCheap Russell 2000 Stocks: Healthpeak Properties (PEAK) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUnlike many of today’s cheat Russell 2000 stocks, Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:PEAK) thrives in any interest rate environment. Furthermore, the company’s management is at the forefront of emerging healthcare trends, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking flexibility and responsiveness alongside the wider real estate sector’s upside potential.\n\nIn response to senior living facilities’ challenges during the pandemic, management decisively sold most of its senior housing assets for about $4 billion in 2020 and 2021. The company then strategically reinvested the proceeds into life science and medical office portfolios, sectors with high-quality assets in leading markets and top-tier tenants, both marking today’s top emerging healthcare segments.\n\nHealthpeak’s strategic repositioning allows it to capitalize on potential regulatory changes in healthcare, especially cost-management initiatives targeting aging populations on fixed incomes. With its high-quality facilities in niche markets, Healthpeak is well-positioned to meet the rising demand from premier healthcare systems, anticipating that those who can afford it will demand a more concierge experience.\n\nFirstCash Holdings (FCFS) An image of a laptop with money flying out of the screen\n\nFirstCash Holdings (NASDAQ:FCFS) thrives in a shrinking economy by offering pawn services nationally and globally. To that end, the company’s stock posted a decent 9% gain year-to-date, widely in line with wider markets. Anticipate another increase as we enter the summer season and consumers sell unwanted spring cleaning items for quick cash. FirstCash stands out among typical pawn shops by also providing a range of fintech-style financing and payment options, positioning itself as a pioneer in a world increasingly moving away from cash transactions.\n\nDespite high investment outflows, FirstCash consistently generates substantial free cash flow, totaling $355 million over the past 12 months. Its growth trajectory is stable, averaging 25% annual revenue growth and 27% annual net income expansion over the past three years. Between 2021 and 2022, net income more than doubled, and that momentum hasn’t yet abated. While initial gains could be partly due to reduced pawn interactions during the pandemic, economic tightening likely contributed to the increase. If this trend continues, the cheap Russell 2000 stock is set for similar gains as we enter 2024’s second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) portfolio is rich with what the Oracle of Omaha would refer to as “wonderful” businesses. Though Berkshire’s portfolio has skewed away from technology stocks in prior decades, one can’t help but notice that the modern-day Berkshire portfolio has pivoted towards the modern age.\n\nAnd we’re not just talking about the conglomerate’s massive stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Aside from the iPhone maker, which still comprises a huge portion of the overall Berkshire portfolio, even after trimming by 13%, Berkshire owns a sprinkling (less than 1%) in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nApart from Berkshire’s tech-savvy bets, many other holdings within the Berkshire portfolio always stand to gain a lot by investing in technological initiatives. Most notably, AmericanExpress (NYSE:AXP) stands out as a firm that’s equipped to thrive in the data-driven age with its analytics capabilities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we’ll examine three Warren Buffett stocks that look irresistible as they embrace tech to boost long-term growth.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express is one of the older holdings within the Berkshire portfolio. Still, unlike other older Berkshire investments that have dragged their feet on the returns front of late, the premier credit card firm has continued to deliver impressive gains. Year-to-date, AXP stock is up more than 28%, thanks in part to some amazing quarters that shot past analyst expectations.\n\nConsumer sentiment could easily get choppier from here as inflation’s impact continues to weigh. That said, American Express looks poised to continue posting solid numbers, as its “spend-centric” model keeps flexing its muscles, even in the face of high inflation and macro headwinds that stand to impact global spending.\n\nWell-of Amex cardholders and spend-happy Millennials, some of whom were brought on just in the past year, do not look to be putting their cards away. As they continue buying a wide range of goods with their Gold and Platinum cards at 2024-era prices, AXP stock certainly stands out as one of the better inflation-fighting stocks in the market. Higher prices on just about everything translate into larger tabs on one’s monthly Amex bill.\n\nFurther, given its recent resilience and continued investments in digital transformation, AXP stock still seems a tad undervalued at less than 20 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a much smaller holding in the Berkshire portfolio at less than 1% at the time of writing. Indeed, Berkshire and Buffett seem to be fans of the credit card business, and it’s not a mystery as to why. Though V stock hasn’t been nearly as hot, up 7.3%, trailing the market by about 3%, I do view the leading credit card company as worth pursuing after its recent roadbump.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, Piper Sandler started V stock with an overweight rating. The company’s impressive network, which has high barriers to entry around it (a wide economic moat), and tech prowess were major reasons why Piper is a fan of the stock.\n\nMost notably, Piper outlined the potential for generative AI to help “drive upside to fundamentals.” Undoubtedly, Visa is as much a financial technology company as it is a creditcard firm. And you can bet it’s taking generative AI seriously as it seeks to gain any operating or growth edge it can get.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center.

Investors and Buffett followers have plenty of reasons to buy the stock, even if Berkshire is inclined to continue trimming in the near future.\n\nThe rest of 2024 could see Apple’s most aggressive push into generative AI yet, with the WWDC24 to begin on June 10, 2024. Reports suggest the annual multi-day conference could be heavy on generative AI.\n\nWhether it’s as heavy on AI as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google’s recent I/O 2024 event remains to be seen. Regardless, I’m quite bullish on Apple’s near-term future as it looks to bring the AI tech up a notch for its coming iOS 18. With a ChatGPT deal reportedly close to being inked, AAPL stock may have enough drivers to take it right back to all-time highs of close to $198 per share by year’s end.\n\nAt 29.15 times trailing P/E, AAPL stock is getting somewhat frothy again. I view the multiple as worth paying if it means that Siri is going to get a heck of a lot smarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple, Berkshire Hathaway (Class B), Amazon, Alphabet (Class C), and American Express.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 16, 2024 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"What we've seen in Q1 earnings season is a resilient and steadily improving profitability picture, both in terms of the growth rate as well as the evolving revisions trend.\"\n\nCurrent Earnings Outlook Reflects Positivity\n\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nWhat we saw in the Q1 earnings season is a resilient and steadily improving profitability picture, both in terms of the growth rate as well as the evolving revisions trend. Positive revenue surprises were a bit less commonplace relative to other recent periods, but margins expanded at a better-than-expected rate. Total earnings for the 461 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 59.7% beating revenue estimates. The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 461 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +4.8% Q1 earnings growth pace improves to +11.4% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers’s one-time charge are accounted for. For 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.1% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd.\n\nIn recent weeks, we have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates.\n\nWe started seeing this favorable turn in the revisions trend roughly around when the Q1 earnings reports started coming out. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year.\n\nWe have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space. This week, we will discuss the evolving earnings outlook for the ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks.\n\nPlease note that the $444.3 billion the group is currently expected to earn in 2024 is up from $443.9 billion last week and $438.1 billion the week prior to that.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe all know that the revisions trend for Tesla TSLA has been negative for a while now, while the same for Apple AAPL is also negative, though the magnitude of negative revisions for Apple is far less severe.\n\nThe revisions trend for the remaining five members of this group is positive enough to more than offset the Tesla and Apple effects. Of these five, Nvidia NVDA is in a league of its own.\n\nA big part of this year’s earnings growth is expected to come from margins reversing last year’s declines and starting to expand again. The expectation is that aggregate net margins this year get back to the 2022 level, with the Tech sector driving most of the gains.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "D.C. is testing its Big Tech antitrust campaign far from D.C.",
        "content": "The Biden administration is testing its antitrust push far from Washington as it seeks to unwind the dominance of Big Tech.\n\nNo longer is the nation’s capital the go-to trial venue of choice for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as they file competition challenges against the biggest names in Silicon Valley.\n\nInstead, it’s New Jersey where the government chose to sue Apple (AAPL). Or California, where it challenged Microsoft (MSFT). Or the state of Washington, where it confronted Amazon (AMZN). Or Virginia, where it filed a second antitrust suit against Google (GOOG,GOOGL).\n\n\"They’re clearly filing these tech cases in different jurisdictions where the law is less developed,\" said Douglas Ross, a professor of antitrust at the University of Washington School of Law. \"And they're doing it for a reason.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks during a news conference on March 21, as he announced a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The case was filed in New Jersey. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nA variety of strategies could explain the multi-jurisdictional approach, according to antitrust lawyers.\n\nProsecutors could be targeting appeals courts with case law more favorable to their legal theories, since all of the district courts selected by Biden’s FTC and DOJ report to different courts of appeals.\n\nThe government could also be weighing the speed of a court in handling litigation and the convenience to anticipated witnesses, said Juan Arteaga, a partner with Crowell & Moring’s antitrust litigation division.\n\nIt’s also possible, he added, that government officials may want to showcase vigorous anticompetitive enforcement to the rest of the country.\n\n\"I think the current leadership team and the DOJ antitrust division have really made it a point to try to take antitrust enforcement out of the D.C. bubble,\" Arteaga said.\n\nRoss is more skeptical of a strategy that seeks out jurisdictions where judges have less antitrust experience and fewer controlling antitrust cases are on the books.\n\nOutside of D.C. and a few other popular antitrust districts, Ross said, \"antitrust is like a hen's tooth — there are very few cases, and most average federal district judges have heard zero antitrust cases.\"\n\nD.C.'s dominance\n\nD.C. has long been the chosen spot for many of the most prominent antitrust cases in US history, including landmark cases against AT&T (T) and Microsoft in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nIts dominance extends back even further in time.\n\nSince 1899, the earliest year records are available, the DOJ filed 391 antitrust cases in the district.\n\nThat is nearly double the next closest counts of 222 filings in the Northern District of California and 220 in the Southern District of New York.\n\nStory continues Then-Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates at a June 2000 press conference in Redmond, Wash., to discuss the Justice Department's antitrust case against his company. (DAN LEVINE/AFP via Getty Images) (DAN LEVINE via Getty Images)\n\nIt held its dominance for most of the last decade as well. D.C. was home to the most new cases or tied for that title from 2015 through 2022.\n\nThat changed last year. In 2023, the government filed more antitrust cases in several places outside D.C., including states like Michigan and Oklahoma.\n\nWhen factoring in private antitrust suits, the district with the most combined competition suits last year — totaling 42 — was the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Federal district courts in New Jersey, Illinois, and New York followed.\n\nThe government's shift away from D.C. is happening at a time when there are rising concerns within the legal community about judge shopping in hopes of sympathetic rulings and state and federal governments intervening in private antitrust litigation.\n\nBills to disrupt judicial power in single-judge districts have been introduced in the Senate, and the Judicial Conference recommended changes to the case assignment process in March.\n\nChanging course\n\nThe Biden White House started its campaign against Big Tech close to home, in the D.C. District Court. That's where the FTC, under its Biden-nominated Chair Lina Khan, refiled an action against Facebook in 2021.\n\nThat case, first brought during former President Trump’s administration, alleged that the social media giant illegally blocked competition through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nIt also took over another case filed in D.C. by the prior administration, against Google, challenging the company’s online search dominance. A ruling from the judge in that case is expected soon.\n\nThen prosecutors changed course and veered away from D.C.\n\nIn December 2022, the FTC chose the US District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge Microsoft’s acquisition of video gaming giant Activision Blizzard. The effort failed, and the regulators appealed the matter to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nA month later, in January 2023, the DOJ, joined by eight state attorneys general, went after Google in a second antitrust case, this time in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Prosecutors alleged Google abused its monopoly in the digital advertising technology market.\n\nIn September of 2023, the FTC and 17 states sued Amazon in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit accused the retail giant of illegally monopolizing online marketplace services.\n\nThen this year in March, the DOJ and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple in the US District Court in New Jersey. The prosecutors claimed Apple illegally abused its dominance in the smartphone market.\n\n'Trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit'\n\nNew Jersey is a less logical place for the government to challenge Apple when compared to some of the other cases outside D.C.\n\nAmazon was targeted in the Washington district, where the company is headquartered, and Microsoft was sued in the Bay Area, where it has a significant physical footprint.\n\nBut Apple isn't domiciled in New Jersey nor does it have dominant operations there.\n\nOne factor that may help explain the government's choice is that appeals from New Jersey's federal trial courts are heard by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which in recent years has handed down decisions that could favor the government's claims against the iPhone maker.\n\n\"I think I think that the DOJ concluded that the case law was much more favorable for the Third Circuit as opposed to the Ninth Circuit,\" Arteaga said. Apple CEO Tim Cook in April. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAs for the case against Google in Virginia, the DOJ may be looking for a quick turn. The Eastern District court has earned its \"rocket docket\" nickname for the speed with which it handles litigation.\n\n\"I think there probably is an element of trying to avoid the D.C. Circuit,\" Ross said.\"Whether that's going to pay off for them or hurt them, I don't know.\"\n\nThe tactic, he said, could lead to more chaos in the law and increase the chances of getting one of the cases heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nKeith Harrison, also a partner in Crowell & Moring’s litigation practice, said bringing the cases against the country's most dominant and consumer-facing companies could prove valuable for the administration, win or lose, as it tries to communicate its agenda to a broader population.\n\n\"This [Apple] case is going to be a big case, wherever it's brought,\" Harrison said. \"But in New Jersey, it’s going to be the biggest case in that courthouse, and in local news on a regular basis.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Hedge fund Coatue scraps its Apple stake in Q1, while Viking built its position",
        "content": "By Carolina Mandl\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Coatue Management dissolved its stake in Apple Inc in the first quarter while Viking Global Investors built a sizeable new position, securities filings showed on Wednesday. Coatue, founded by Philippe Laffont, had 2.4 million shares of Apple in December, worth $470.6 million. Regulatory filings showed it had dissolved that stake entirely by the end of March.\n\nApple's shares plunged almost 11% in the first quarter as the company faced fiercer competition in China and falling revenues. Shares in the iPhone maker have pared losses in the second quarter and are now down 1.5% year to date. Other big investors have cut their stakes in Apple. Earlier this month, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had trimmed its position by 13%. Still, Buffett praised the company during Berkshire's annual meeting, saying the iPhone was \"one of the greatest products.\" Coatue's filing also showed it reduced its stake in chipmaking giant Nvidia by roughly 68% to 1.4 million shares, or $1.2 billion. Year to date, shares in Nvidia are up 91%.\n\nCoatue also trimmed its position in electric vehicle maker Tesla by 37% to 2.6 million shares. The company's shares are down almost 30% this year amid fierce competition and slowing sales. Coatue, however, more than doubled its holdings in Google-parent Alphabet, to 5.7 million shares. Conversely, Viking showed in the filing a new $663.8 million stake in Apple and a similar position in Microsoft.\n\nThe funds' positions were revealed in quarterly securities fillings known as 13Fs. While backward looking, these snapshots show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current holdings.\n\nBoth Coatue and Viking are so-called Tiger cubs, hedge funds seeded by veteran investor Julian Robertson, founder of Tiger Management.\n\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl, in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)\n\nView comments",

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) accounts for about 25% of TSM’s revenue.

We believe the outlook for AAPL remains strong with slow growth in iPhone (now #1 global market share) and faster growth in the higher margin services business.

        "content": "Even amidst macroeconomic headwinds, the S&P 500 index has remained resilient. For the year-to-date, the index has trended higher by 10%. While it’s good to remain optimistic, preparing for the worst is equally important. I don’t intend to be a fearmonger and it’s unlikely that there will be a big crash. However, even a 10% to 15% correction in the index is significant. To remain prepared for any such scenario, this column intends to discuss some low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy and hold.\n\nIt’s first important to understand the reason for remaining cautious. GDP growth decelerated in Q1 2024, and this calls for rate cuts. However, with stubborn inflation, the Fed will likely be slow in pursuing expansionary policies. Fear of a hard landing will likely be the catalyst for a market correction.\n\nThe first-rate cut is likely before the Presidential elections. Therefore, any weakness in the market would be an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. For now, let’s discuss three low-risk, high-reward stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPanasonic Holdings (PCRFY) 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn my view, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stock is a low-risk bet for two reasons. First, PCRFY stock has already been oversold and has mainly remained sideways in the last 12 months. Considering a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.5, I don’t see a downside from current levels for this 1.26% dividend yield stock.\n\nFurther, Panasonic Holdings is among the major players in the EV battery market. The company is high on innovation and has ambitious expansion plans through 2031. Once industry sentiments change, PCRFY stock is likely to deliver multibagger returns.\n\nIn terms of expansion plans, Panasonic is targeting to boost its EV battery manufacturing capacity to 200GWh by 2031. This will translate into steady revenue growth coupled with EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nOn the innovation front, Panasonic has partnered with Sila Nanotechnologies to “purchase next-generation nano-composite silicon anode material for EV lithium-ion batteries.” By 2031, Panasonic aims to achieve a 25% increase in battery energy density. With all these positives, it’s a good time to buy PCRFY stock.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last few quarters have been mixed for technology stocks. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has surged 215% in the previous 12 months. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has remained sideways during the same period. In my view, investors can consider some allocation to innovation driven ideas that have remained subdued. Apple is possibly among the best names to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn important point to note is that the application of AI is being talked about across sectors. AI is expected to contribute $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. I believe the markets are waiting for Apple’s big AI push. Once that’s clear, AAPL stock is likely to surge higher.\n\nApple ended Q2 2024 with $161 billion in cash and equivalents. This provides ample flexibility to invest in next-generation technology for its devices. Apple has already been making small acquisitions in the AI space. In another recent news, Apple is planning to sell its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset outside the United States. The wearable and services segment has ample scope for growth in the coming years.\n\nVale (VALE) the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong blue-chip commodity stocks, Vale (NYSE:VALE) is worth buying at current levels of $12.5. VALE stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.2, indicatinghe extent of undervaluation. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 8.8%.\n\nRegarding potential returns, analysts have a median price target of $16 for the stock. This would imply an upside of 28% from current levels. Therefore, the total return from VALE stock is likely at 35% to 40% in the next 12 months, with valuations indicating limited downside risk.\n\nVale will benefit from relatively higher iron ore prices from a business perspective. A possible rate cut towards the end of the year can trigger a rally for industrial commodities. This will support revenue and adjust EBITDA upside.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for Q1 2024, Vale reported the highest quarterly iron ore production since 2019. Copper and nickel production also witnessed healthy growth. If this trend is sustained, the company will be positioned to deliver strong free cash flows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. unveiled a $6.7 billion stake in insurer Chubb Ltd., ending months of suspense over its mystery position in a financial firm, previously kept concealed in regulatory filings.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSlovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed S&P 500 Tops 5,300 in Record-Breaking Stock Rally: Markets Wrap How One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt\n\nBerkshire disclosed the holding in a filing on Wednesday, reflecting its positions at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe conglomerate has been building the stake since 2023 but it hadn’t previously been reported because the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Berkshire to keep it confidential. Still, separate quarterly filings reflected that Berkshire’s equity stakes in banks, insurance and finance companies were growing, while the firm was pulling back in other industries including consumer products.\n\n“Millions of people follow what Buffett does,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland‘s Robert H. Smith School of Business, explaining why Berkshire wants confidentiality while it amasses big positions. “Warren Buffett would be more sensitive to the issue than others.”\n\nChubb stock jumped in after-hours trading, adding as much as 9.9%.\n\nBuffett’s Berkshire is deeply familiar with the insurance industry, owning a range of companies including Geico and National Indemnity. The billionaire investor has called Berkshire’s property-casualty insurance operation the “core” of the conglomerate, helping generate “float” that can then be reinvested.\n\nThe conglomerate has also invested in other businesses in the insurance industry. Berkshire owns a stake in Aon Plc, a major broker, and has previously bet on rivals including Marsh & McLennan Cos.\n\nCash Pile\n\nBuffett already revealed a few recent changes to his company’s holdings at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha earlier this month. It trimmed a stake in Apple Inc. to $135.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, as the iPhone maker faces a range of struggles including an antitrust fine, sliding sales in China and a failed car project.\n\nThe billionaire investor heaped praise on the tech giant at the meeting — which Apple CEO Tim Cook attended — and said it will remain Berkshire’s largest investment barring any dramatic changes.\n\nThe cash pile at Berkshire reached a record $189 billion at the end of March. Buffett said at the annual meeting that it was “a fair assumption” that it will hit $200 billion by the end of this quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nFunds with more than $100 million must file disclosures about their holdings within 45 days of the end of each quarter, providing a glimpse into the holdings of secretive money managers including hedge funds and large family offices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits The DNA Test Delusion US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports Silicon Valley Is Searching for Its Piece of the AI Action\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "Choosing stocks that you never have to sell has enormous advantages. If you choose well, it means you can let the investment compound in value for potentially decades. As Warren Buffett knows all too well, uninterrupted compound interest is the best way to build lasting wealth.\n\nSince 1965, Buffett's investing skills have steered Berkshire Hathaway's shares to an awe-inspiring return of 4,384,748% through 2023. A key component of those returns was selected investments in stocks of strong companies in its $300-plus-billion equity portfolio. Let's look at two of its top stock holdings that can grow for decades.\n\nApple\n\nWarren Buffett has a long history of betting big on strong consumer brands. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has a loyal customer base that is willing to give up many other things before their iPhones. The stock has returned 531% since Berkshire first started buying the stock in 2016, which brought its stake to a value of $174 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nApple doesn't report high revenue growth every year. It tends to come in cycles, such as when the company releases a popular new version of the iPhone. But even in years when Apple reports a slight decline in revenue, it's still seeing the active installed base of devices continue to grow.\n\nA growing installed base is very valuable to Apple, as people who own more than one Apple device tend to spend more on apps and subscriptions in the App Store. Although services make up a small percentage of the company's total revenue, it generates higher margins.\n\nAcross all products and services, Apple raked in $100 billion in profit last year. This allowed the company to return $27 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases last quarter. Apple just raised the quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share and authorized an additional $110 billion in share repurchases.\n\nWarren Buffett loves companies that have shareholder-friendly capital return policies, especially when those companies still have opportunities to keep growing. Analysts expect Apple's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 10% over the long term. Investors may expect a return consistent with that estimate.\n\nMastercard\n\nMastercard(NYSE: MA) is one of the most recognizable consumer brands around. With billions of cards in people's wallets, the company has delivered consistent growth over the years that has made investors a lot of money. The stock returned 514% over the last decade, and because the global commerce market is so massive, Mastercard can grow the value of your investment for decades to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsistent with its global growth opportunity, Mastercard's revenue grew 11% year over year in the first quarter, with adjusted net income up 16%. These results reflect management's ongoing push to grow the adoption of electronic payments and displace cash and checks. The traditional credit cards specialist is adapting to the increasingly digital global economy.\n\nOn that note, Mastercard secured more new deals in the quarter in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and Europe. It's also making progress in contactless transactions, such as Tap to Phone, which allows businesses to accept payment from a mobile wallet or contactless card on an NFC-enabled device. Mastercard is already accepted in over 100 million locations worldwide, but management believes Tap to Phone can extend that opportunity even further.\n\nThe company's strong brand and huge growth opportunities explain why Berkshire Hathaway held nearly 4 million shares worth $1.7 billion at the end of 2023. Analysts expect Mastercard to grow earnings per share by 16% in the coming years, or enough growth to potentially double the share price in five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google is reinventing itself for the AI age",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is in the midst of a full-blown AI evolution. On Tuesday, the company announced a flurry of AI products and services during its I/O developer conference with the aim of repositioning itself as the world’s AI software leader.\n\n“We are fully in our Gemini era,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote, referring to the company’s latest Gemini AI models, while noting that AI is still “in the very early days of the AI platform shift.”\n\nFor years, Google was considered Silicon Valley’s AI powerhouse. But OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) threw the company off course, entering into a multibillion-dollar, multiyear partnership in 2023 that saw Microsoft integrate OpenAI’s most advanced models into its productivity, search, and cloud products.\n\nAll this helped crown Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company earlier this year.\n\nGoogle’s climb back hasn’t been easy. It originally debuted a ChatGPT competitor called Bard that fell short of initial expectations. And more recently, it bungled the rollout of its generative AI-powered image generator, a tool that the company admitted was not “working the way we intended.” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai updates the world about Google's latest products during the company's I/O developer conference on Tuesday. (Christoph Dernbach/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nStealing back the AI throne starts with Google reinventing its most important product: Search. Now — or soon, as it’s rolling out over time — at the top of the screen, you’ll find a generative AI-powered area called AI Overview that offers summarized responses to queries along with links to the sources.\n\nIt’s a major departure for Google and could impact everything from the company’s advertisers, its main source of revenue, to websites that rely on the firm for search traffic, such as travel platforms and media organizations.\n\nWhile the Search changes are easily the biggest updates to Google’s public-facing products, they weren’t the only consequential announcements at the show. Google also showed off a new AI-powered prototype assistant called Project Astra.\n\nDuring a pre-recorded stage demo, the platform, which views content streamed through your smartphone camera, was able to identify objects, solve programming problems, and more. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai discusses Google's new AI push during the company's I/O developers conference on Tuesday. (Christoph Dernbach/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nUnlike digital assistants Google Assistant and Apple’s (AAPL) Siri, Project Astra offers a more creative, conversational tone that sounds more human-like. It’s even able to understand when you interrupt it, stopping to listen without getting mad. Not human-like!\n\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin, who was touring the I/O demo areas, said the technology behind Project Astra would have been helpful for the company’s canceled Google Glass, adding that the headset was 10 years ahead of its time.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Google’s announcement came a day after OpenAI debuted its own GPT-4o model, which, based on pre-recorded and live-streamed demos, is capable of many of the same tasks as Project Astra. What’s more, OpenAI is making parts of its GPT-4o model available to users for free, while Google says it will charge for access to Project Astra.\n\nGoogle also revealed AI updates to its Workspace productivity suite, including bringing Gemini to the Gmail mobile app. The feature allows users to quickly summarize emails and write contextual replies based on messages.\n\nAndroid, Google’s mobile operating system, also received its share of generative AI improvements, including scam call detection and the ability to add AI-generated images and more to text messages and Gmail.\n\nAs of now, that puts Google far ahead of Apple, which has yet to introduce generative AI features to its iOS operating system for the iPhone. But that is largely expected to change when the company hosts its annual WWDC event in June.\n\nEven if Apple debuts new generative AI offerings, it could still be a boon for Google, since, according to Bloomberg, Apple is working to use Google’s Gemini to power the iPhone’s AI capabilities. But Apple is also in talks with OpenAI. Folks, we've got an AI bake-off.\n\nFor now, Google appears to be back on top. While GPT-4o cooled some of the excitement around Project Astra, Google’s AI Overview for Search will expose far more people to its generative AI technologies than Microsoft or Apple when the latter shows its hand.\n\nBut with Microsoft preparing to host its Build developer conference next week, Google’s lead could be short-lived.

        "title": "Forget iPhone: 4 Reasons to Bet on Apple ETFs",
        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year with a flat performance, falling short of other mega-cap technology companies. Investors should note that Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS has jumped 23.6% this year while Apple is up 0.9%.\n\nApple's lesser exposure to AI within the “Magnificent Seven” group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market are being held responsible for this lackluster performance.\n\nApple’s Sales Struggle in China\n\nApple, in fact, faced a huge setback in China's smartphone market during the first quarter of the year, experiencing a 19% decline in shipments, its worst performance since 2020, per Reuters. This decline was due to the direct impact of Huawei's new product launches in the premium segment.\n\nApple's share in China's smartphone market plunged to 15.7% from 19.7% a year earlier, placing it almost neck-and-neck with Huawei, which saw a remarkable 70% increase in sales. As a result, Apple lost its position as the top smartphone seller in China and slipped to the third place.\n\nShould we look beyond this weakness and dig deeper into other areas of strength?\n\nApple to Hone in on AI\n\nApple recently unveiled its latest iPad Pros featuring the all-new M4 processor, which promises enhanced performance across various aspects, including AI capabilities. Apple directly challenged competitors like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm by asserting that the M4's neural engine surpasses any other neural processing unit in AI PCs. This move indicates Apple's ambition to lead in AI technology, particularly in the realm of consumer devices.\n\nApple’s heavy investment in AI and CEO Tim Cook's increasing mentions of it indicate a strategic focus on the development of the technology. This includes acquiring smaller AI firms and exploring partnerships with industry leaders like OpenAI and Google.\n\nIntegration With AI to Drive iPhone Sales?\n\nAnalysts anticipate that Apple's advancements in generative AI will drive iPhone sales by introducing compelling new features. As consumers hold onto their devices for longer periods, innovative AI experiences could serve as a significant differentiator between iPhone generations. Moreover, Apple's overall quarterly revenues fell in Q2, but less than what analysts had expected, and Tim Cook expects revenue growth to resume in the current quarter.\n\nImproving Sales Trend in Struggling Sector China\n\nIn the last reported quarter, sales in Greater China, Apple's third-largest region, fell by 8% to $16.37 billion. The figure surpassed FactSet analysts’ anticipated sales of $15.25 billion. This performance may alleviate concerns among investors about Apple losing market share to local competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s Dividend Hike\n\nApple increased its cash dividend by 4% and authorized an additional program to buy back $110 billion worth of stock. The buyback is the largest in Apple’s history. In 2018, the tech giant authorized $100 billion in share repurchases.\n\nShould You Buy Apple Via ETF Route?\n\nThe AAPL stock has gained 8.2% past month and erased losses it recorded at the start of the year. In the past week, the stock has climbed 2.2%. The stock has an upbeat Momentum Score of “B” but the stock lacks on value.\n\nInvestors intending to follow the bullish momentum but still wary of slowing sales of Apple may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other big tech companies’ stellar presence.\n\nBelow, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.\n\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 19.10% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF VGT – AAPL occupies the second location with 16.39% weight.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google is bolstering security features in the latest version of Android, the world’s most popular mobile operating system, which it previewed at the company’s annual developer conference.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US ‘Containment’ Jamie Dimon Sees ‘Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us’ Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt Dow Average Makes History to Hit the 40,000 Mark: Markets Wrap\n\nAndroid 15 will add capabilities to deter theft and better protect users against fraud, scams and various other attacks that could compromise data on a device, the company said Wednesday at Google I/O in Mountain View, California. There’ll also be a new so-called private space to secure sensitive information and ways to remotely lock devices, including ones that have been taken offline.\n\nArchrival Apple Inc. has made iPhone privacy and security a key selling point, aiming to gain an edge on Android-powered devices from Google and partners like Samsung Electronics Co. Now Google appears keen to close that gap with a wave of changes and updates. Samsung, which trades the title of world’s biggest smartphone maker with Apple, has also devised a suite of user-protection features under its Knox brand.\n\nAlongside the discussion of the next version of Android, which can be expected to arrive at roughly the same time as the latest iteration of Google’s Pixel smartphones, usually released in October, Google talked about its wider ecosystem momentum.\n\nIts Wear OS for watches increased users by 40% in 2023, while its Android TV operating system reached 220 million active devices over the past year, marking a 47% rise. There are also now more than 200 million cars on the road compatible with Google’s Android Auto software.\n\nElsewhere at I/O, Google executives such as co-founder Sergey Brin hinted at the return of augmented-reality glasses with the help of AI. One of the company’s buzziest announcements was Project Astra — an AI agent that can use a smartphone camera to “see” the world around it and answer questions about the scenery.\n\nArtificial intelligence additions are going to be a major point of differentiation for mobile software makers, and Google can expect a response from Apple when it hosts its Worldwide Developers Conference in June in Cupertino, California.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Neuralink’s First Patient: ‘It Blows My Mind So Much’ The DNA Test Delusion Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple announces new accessibility features, including Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts",
        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif., May 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced new accessibility features coming later this year, including Eye Tracking, a way for users with physical disabilities to control iPad® or iPhone® with their eyes. Additionally, Music Haptics will offer a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine® in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts will allow users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when using iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle; and more accessibility features will come to visionOS™. These features combine the power of Apple hardware and software, harnessing Apple silicon, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to further Apple’s decades-long commitment to designing products for everyone.\n\n\"We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,\" said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. \"That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.\"\n\n\"Each year, we break new ground when it comes to accessibility,\" said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. \"These new features will make an impact in the lives of a wide range of users, providing new ways to communicate, control their devices, and move through the world.\"\n\nEye Tracking Comes to iPad and iPhone\n\nPowered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.\n\nEye Tracking works across iPadOS® and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.\n\nMusic Haptics Makes Songs More Accessible\n\nMusic Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music® catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew Features for a Wide Range of Speech\n\nWith Vocal Shortcuts, iPhone and iPad users can assign custom utterances that Siri® can understand to launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks. Listen for Atypical Speech, another new feature, gives users an option for enhancing speech recognition for a wider range of speech. Listen for Atypical Speech uses on-device machine learning to recognize user speech patterns. Designed for users with acquired or progressive conditions that affect speech, such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or stroke, these features provide a new level of customization and control, building on features introduced in iOS 17 for users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve speech recognition for millions of people with atypical speech, so we are thrilled that Apple is bringing these new accessibility features to consumers,\" said Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, the Speech Accessibility Project at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s principal investigator. \"The Speech Accessibility Project was designed as a broad-based, community-supported effort to help companies and universities make speech recognition more robust and effective, and Apple is among the accessibility advocates who made the Speech Accessibility Project possible.\"\n\nVehicle Motion Cues Can Help Reduce Motion Sickness\n\nVehicle Motion Cues is a new experience for iPhone and iPad that can help reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles. Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.\n\nCarPlay Gets Voice Control, More Accessibility Updates\n\nAccessibility features coming to CarPlay® include Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition. With Voice Control, users can navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice. With Sound Recognition, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens. For users who are colorblind, Color Filters make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use, with additional visual accessibility features including Bold Text and Large Text.\n\nAccessibility Features Coming to visionOS\n\nThis year, accessibility features coming to visionOS will include systemwide Live Captions to help everyone — including users who are deaf or hard of hearing — follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps. With Live Captions for FaceTime® in visionOS, more users can easily enjoy the unique experience of connecting and collaborating using their Persona. Apple Vision Pro™ will add the capability to move captions using the window bar during Apple Immersive Video, as well as support for additional Made for iPhone hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Updates for vision accessibility will include the addition of Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users who have low vision, or those who want to avoid bright lights and frequent flashing.\n\nThese features join the dozens of accessibility features already available in Apple Vision Pro, which offers a flexible input system and an intuitive interface designed with a wide range of users in mind. Features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters can also provide users who are blind or have low vision access to spatial computing, while features such as Guided Access can support users with cognitive disabilities. Users can control Vision Pro with any combination of their eyes, hands, or voice, with accessibility features including Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control that can also help those with physical disabilities.\n\n\"Apple Vision Pro is without a doubt the most accessible technology I’ve ever used,\" said Ryan Hudson-Peralta, a Detroit-based product designer, accessibility consultant, and cofounder of Equal Accessibility LLC. \"As someone born without hands and unable to walk, I know the world was not designed with me in mind, so it’s been incredible to see that visionOS just works. It’s a testament to the power and importance of accessible and inclusive design.\"\n\nAdditional Updates\n\nFor users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver will include new voices, a flexible Voice Rotor, custom volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac®. Magnifier will offer a new Reader Mode and the option to easily launch Detection Mode with the Action button. Braille users will get a new way to start and stay in Braille Screen Input for faster control and text editing; Japanese language availability for Braille Screen Input; support for multi-line braille with Dot Pad; and the option to choose different input and output tables. For users with low vision, Hover Typing shows larger text when typing in a text field, and in a user’s preferred font and color. For users at risk of losing their ability to speak, Personal Voice will be available in Mandarin Chinese. Users who have difficulty pronouncing or reading full sentences will be able to create a Personal Voice using shortened phrases. For users who are nonspeaking, Live Speech will include categories and simultaneous compatibility with Live Captions. For users with physical disabilities, Virtual Trackpad for AssistiveTouch® allows users to control their device using a small region of the screen as a resizable trackpad. Switch Control will include the option to use the cameras in iPhone and iPad to recognize finger-tap gestures as switches. Voice Control will offer support for custom vocabularies and complex words.\n\nCelebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day with Apple\n\nThis week, Apple is introducing new features, curated collections, and more in celebration of Global Accessibility Awareness Day:\n\nThroughout the month of May, select Apple Store® locations will host free sessions to help customers explore and discover accessibility features built into the products they love. Apple Piazza Liberty in Milan will feature the talent behind \"Assume that I can,\" the viral campaign for World Down Syndrome Day. And available year-round at Apple Store locations globally, Today at Apple® group reservations are a place where friends, families, schools, and community groups can learn about accessibility features together. Shortcuts adds Calming Sounds, which plays ambient soundscapes to minimize distractions, helping users focus or rest. Visit the App Store® to discover incredible apps and games that promote access and inclusion for all, including the accessible App Store Award-winning game Unpacking, apps as tools for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), and more. The Apple TV® app will honor trailblazing creators, performers, and activists who passionately share the experiences of people with disabilities. This year’s theme is Remaking the World, and each story invites viewers to envision a reality where everyone is empowered to add their voice to the greater human story. Apple Books® will spotlight lived experiences of disability through curated collections of first-person narratives by disabled writers in ebook and audiobook formats. Apple Fitness+℠ workouts, meditations, and trainer tips welcome users who are deaf or hard of hearing with American Sign Language, and Time to Walk® now includes transcripts in the Apple Podcasts® app. Fitness+ workouts always include Audio Hints to support users who are blind or have low vision, as well as modifiers so that users of all levels can participate. Users can visit Apple Support to learn how their Apple devices can be customized using built-in accessibility features. From adapting the gestures to customizing how information is presented on a device’s screen, the Apple Accessibility playlist will help users learn how to personalize Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch®, and Mac to work best for them.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "Looking for profitable investments? Start by looking at Warren Buffett's portfolio. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), has posted average annual returns of nearly 20% since inception.\n\nTwo Buffett stocks in particular look like great buys right now.\n\nDon't ignore this $135 billion technology bet\n\nBuffett isn't known for his technology investments. But in recent years, technology stocks have dominated his portfolio. One of his biggest technology investments -- in fact, it's his biggest current investment right now regardless of sector -- is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire's Apple position is currently worth about $135 billion. That's nearly half of the company's entire portfolio of publicly traded stocks!\n\nWhat do Buffett and his team like most about Apple right now? It's an iconic company with strong customer loyalty. It has a history and brand name prestige that's difficult to replicate. It also has the scale and capital to compete in an industry where scale and capital matter greatly. Last year, for instance, Apple spent nearly $30 billion on research and development, up from just $6 billion a decade ago.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reason Buffett loves Apple stock is because it's a cash flow machine. During the past decade, Apple has generated more than $700 billion in free cash flow. It's used this excess cash to ramp up innovation spending, institute huge share buyback programs, and pay out a small dividend.\n\nIt's important to note that Berkshire was a net seller of Apple stock last quarter, but Buffett has suggested that the sale was partially due to tax considerations. Buffett highlighted that it is \"extremely likely\" that Apple will remain Berkshire's biggest position through the rest of the year. At 29 times earnings, Apple stock price isn't exactly cheap, but it remains one of the best stock picks for those looking to follow Buffett's biggest bets.\n\nThis is still Buffett's number 1 stock\n\nWarren Buffett has been a near-constant buyer of a certain stock for years. Most of his fortune is tied up in this stock, and lately his purchases have accelerated. We are, of course, talking about Berkshire Hathaway itself. Since 2014, its total share count has fallen by 13% thanks to a slew of share buybacks. Last year, Berkshire repurchased $9.2 billion of its own shares. In 2021 alone, it repurchased $27 billion in stock.\n\nIn a market where bargains are hard to come by, Buffett has been regularly snapping up Berkshire shares. With repurchases still in progress, it's clear that he still views the company's own stock as a good value. But there's another reason he's probably a fan of buying back more stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the latest Berkshire annual shareholder meeting, Buffett revealed his belief that corporate tax rates would soon rise, a belief that at least partially led Berkshire to trim its Apple stake. \"With present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give,\" Buffett noted. \"Higher taxes are quite likely, and if the government wants to take a greater share of your income or mine or Berkshire's, they can do it. And they may decide that someday they don't want the fiscal deficit to be this large.\"\n\nThis snippet suggests that Buffett is conscious of tax liabilities when it comes to calculating total returns. This consideration makes buying back Berkshire stock a no-brainer. While the Inflation Reduction Act imposed a new 1% excise tax on buybacks, share buybacks are still more tax efficient than dividends. And if a company sees the value of its repurchased shares rise over the long term, it will face a lower tax bill than if it had invested the money elsewhere and harvested the gains.\n\nIn summary, Berkshire is a great vehicle for Buffett to efficiently direct cash to in a market with few bargains. Berkshire shares aren't the cheapest they've ever been trading at 1.6 times book value, but that's partially skewed by accounting rules that mask the book value accretion of share repurchases. Despite the above-average valuation, Buffett is still directing Berkshire to buy back shares. As with Apple, it's not the best bargain he's ever found, but it's likely still a wise bet with markets trading at lofty valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Banking on Experience: 3 Financial Stock Picks from Wall Street’s Longest-Serving Guru",
        "content": "In life, whether looking for the best financial stocks to buy or the best way to get rich quickly, imitation can be the best form of flattery. Barron’s published an article about bank-stock fund manager David Ellison’s portfolio of financial services stocks in his Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund (MUTF:HLFNX).\n\nEllison has spent 41 years working in the investment industry, the past 27 years running this Hennessey fund and the Hennessey Small Cap Financial Fund (MUTF:HSFNX). He’s been with the fund for so long that it underwent a change in ownership when his old firm, FBR Funds, was acquired by Hennessey in 2012.\n\nYou wouldn’t think an old-school fund manager would own a stock like Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), but it’s the large-cap fund’s sixth-largest holding, accounting for 5.41% of its net assets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile some excellent names are in the top 10 holdings, here are three other financial stocks to buy from one of Wall Street’s longest-serving fund managers.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is Ellison’s 12th-largest holding with a 4.81% weighting.\n\nFormer CEO James Gorman, who stepped down in January and became executive chairman of the investment bank, held the top job for 14 years. During that time, MS shares appreciated by 215%, less than the 323% of the S&P 500, but significantly higher than the 133% return for the Dow Jones U.S. Banks Index. It’s all relative.\n\nAs a January Fortune.com article reminded investors, Morgan Stanley generated most of its revenue from traditional banking and capital markets trading when Gorman took over. He pushed the company hard into asset and wealth management.\n\nAs a result, revenues grew from $16.4 billion in 2010 to $54.14 billion in 2023, with wealth management accounting for nearly 50% of annual revenue.\n\nTwo acquisitions in 2020 also helped it grow revenues, $13 billion for E-Trade and $7 billion for Eaton Vance. The wealth management business will continue to drive its growth.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A ,BRK-B) is Ellison’s 15th-largest holding with a 4.29% weighting.\n\nOne of the big announcements by Warren Buffett and Berkshire in the holding company’s Q1 2024 results released in early May was the 13% reduction in its Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings. Berkshire’s most significant sale was 117 million shares of Apple stock, more than the 93.5 million shares it sold in 2020.\n\nBuffett likes Apple, he called it a better business than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) at its annual meeting in Omaha. However, he wants to keep adding to the company’s cash position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s cash position as of March 31 was more than $188 billion. If its cash were an S&P 500 company, it would be the 42nd largest. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that it makes more than $8 billion annually in income from this cash. Who wouldn’t like it?\n\nWith meme-stock mania back in full force, I think his actions make a lot of sense.\n\nTruist Financial (TFC) Smartphone with website of American financial company Truist Financial Corporation on screen in front of logo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nTruist Financial (NYSE:TFC) is Ellison’s 21st-largest holding with a 1.99% weighting. TFC stock is up nearly 41% over the past year.\n\nAnalysts are lukewarm about the financial stock. Of 23 analysts, 12 rate it a buy with a $43 target, about 10% higher than where it’s currently trading. Understandably, it would be a smaller holding of Ellison’s.\n\nOn May 7, Truist announced the sale of its remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings to a consortium of private equity investors, including Stone Point Capital, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Mubadala Investment Company and other co-investors.\n\n“The sale of TIH significantly enhances Truist’s financial profile and positions Truist to invest in and grow its core banking businesses,” CEO Bill Rogers stated in the transaction’s press release.\n\nMoody’s downgraded Truist’s long-term senior unsecured debt to Baa1 from A3. There’s a difference of opinion about the pros and cons of the deal.\n\nWhile the sale improved the bank’s liquidity and capitalization, Moody’s argues it did so at the expense of revenue diversification. It now has to rely on the net interest income of its lending business, potentially leading to greater earnings volatility.\n\nIt’s a riskier bet that could pay off for aggressive investors and seasoned investment pros such as Ellison.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 86%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are firmly in control on Wall Street. Since the green flag waved at the start of 2023, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-centric Nasdaq Composite have respectively rallied by 19%, 36%, and 56%, as well as hit fresh all-time highs.\n\nWhile certain sectors and industries have played a role in pushing the broader market higher, the \"Magnificent Seven\" are attributed with putting the weight of Wall Street on their proverbial backs and lifting the stock market to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's view of the Magnificent Seven stocks is mixed\n\nThe Magnificent Seven represent seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap, the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAside from each of these businesses handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, they provide well-defined competitive advantages, if not outright moats within their respective industries.\n\nFor example, Alphabet's Google accounts for nearly 91% of worldwide internet search share, while Amazon's e-commerce marketplace oversaw close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also the respective No.'s 1, 2, and 3 in cloud infrastructure service market share by enterprise spend.\n\nDespite the clear-cut catalysts the Magnificent Seven stocks bring to the table, not all Wall Street analysts share an optimistic view for their future. Based on bottom of the barrel price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three Magnificent Seven components could plunge by up to 86%.\n\nMeta Platforms: Implied downside of 24%\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven constituent that at least one analyst believes could meaningfully decline in the not-too-distant future is social media colossus Meta Platforms.\n\nEarlier this month, BNP Paribas Exane analyst Stefan Slowinski, who often takes a contrarian view on some of Wall Street's leading businesses, set a price target of just $360 on shares of Meta. This suggests 24% downside to come, based on the $476.20-per-share closing price, as of May 10.\n\nAccording to Slowinski, Meta lacks new revenue streams, when compared to the other companies spending big on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. This lack of new revenue channels, coupled with the company's forecast of higher capital expenditures tied to AI, have Slowinski believing Meta could underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Meta is the undisputed leader among social media platforms. It owns the top social media \"real estate\" globally, including the most-visited social site (Facebook), and lured 3.24 billion users to its family of apps on a daily basis during the quarter ended in March. Businesses understand they're not going to reach a broader set of eyeballs on any other social media platform, which tends to afford Meta exceptionally strong ad pricing power.\n\nMeta Platforms also benefits from lengthy periods of economic expansion. Since it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising, the company would be vulnerable to a recession. At the moment, a few key indicators, including a historic drop in U.S. M2 money supply, do suggest an economic downturn is probable.\n\nHowever, recessions are short-lived. All 12 U.S. recessions since 1945 have endured between two and 18 months. Comparatively, most periods of growth last for multiple years, and occasionally even stick around for a decade. Ad-driven businesses thrive during these long-winded expansions.\n\nA final reason Slowinski may be forced to eat his words is Meta's balance sheet. The company closed out March with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated north of $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations through the first three months of 2024. In other words, it has the capital to take risks and aggressively invest in its future -- even if the payoff from those investments are a few years away from being truly material to its top and bottom line. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 31%\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that one Wall Street analyst views as anything but \"magnificent\" is semiconductor behemoth Nvidia.\n\nBased on a February note issued by analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, there's concern about demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerating graphics processing units (GPUs) peaking in the current year. With the prospect of slower growth on the horizon, Luria's low-water price target of $620 implies a decline of 31% for Nvidia's stock over the coming year.\n\nOn the bright side, Nvidia's GPUs have come to dominate AI-accelerated data centers. With demand handily outpacing supply, strong pricing power helped to more than triple Data Center segment sales in fiscal 2024 (ended January 28).\n\nBut Luria hit the nail on the head when it comes to competition. While most folks might be focused on external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are both rolling out AI-accelerators for enterprise data centers, it's internal competition from Nvidia's top customers that's the far bigger concern.\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet are Nvidia's four-largest customers and comprise in the neighborhood of 40% of its net sales. But these four giants are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if this is purely for complementary purposes, demand for Nvidia's high-powered chips would likely wane after the current fiscal year.\n\nWhat's more, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment or innovation over the last three decades that didn't navigate its way through a bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors overestimate the uptake or adoption of new technologies. Since no company has benefited more from the rise of AI, Nvidia would, in theory, be hit the hardest if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nLuria's price target on Nvidia is likely to be reached.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 86%\n\nBut the disaster du jour among Magnificent Seven stocks, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street pundit, is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. Gordon Johnson, the CEO and founder of GLJ Research and longtime Tesla bear, believes shares will reach $23.53.\n\nThis weirdly specific price target was arrived at by applying a multiple of 15 times Tesla's earnings per share (EPS) in 2025 and working backwards using a 9% discount rate. Keep in mind this price target was issued earlier this year, and Tesla's consensus EPS for 2025 has declined since then. If Johnson's price target were to prove accurate, shares of Tesla would implode by 86% from where they closed on May 10.\n\nTesla has made a habit of proving skeptics wrong. For instance, it's the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit. Tesla recently introduced its fifth mass-production model (Cybertruck) and has the capacity to roll out more than 2 million EVs annually.\n\nHowever, headwinds are most definitely mounting for North America's leading EV company.\n\nAs an example, increasing EV and hybrid competition has coerced Tesla to slash the sales price of its primary production models (3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. CEO Elon Musk has been clear that his company's price strategy is entirely based on demand. But even with these aggressive cuts, Tesla's inventory levels have soared and its operating margins are tumbling.\n\nTesla's efforts to transform into more than just a car company haven't gone swimmingly, either. Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has slowed dramatically, while Services segment gross margin is consistently in the low-to-mid single digits. Meanwhile, more than half of the company's pre-tax income during the March-ended quarter came from unsustainable sources (e.g., interest income and the sale of regulatory tax credits).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Musk has proved to be a tangible liability for the company. Many of Musk's promises, such as Level 5 autonomy and robotaxis, which are already baked into Tesla's valuation, have failed to come to fruition. The longer these claims go unfulfilled, the likelier it is that Tesla's massive valuation premium to other auto stocks will deflate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Josh Ye\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei is revamping its retail strategy and aggressively opening flagship stores in China, with some just a stone's throw away from Apple shops, as it seeks to retake the premium electronics throne in the world's biggest smartphone market.\n\nSituated directly across from Apple's Shanghai flagship store, Huawei's recently renovated shop spans three floors of a famous heritage architecture building in the financial hub's busy shopping district and includes a coffee shop and a gym.\n\nHuawei opened four such stores in major Chinese cities between December and February, an aggressive marketing blitz by a company that had largely relied on licensed distributors and is rebounding from U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 that had crippled its smartphone business for four years until it could source domestic replacement parts.\n\n\"The Huawei flagship store is very nice. It looks much brighter inside compared to the Apple Store across the street,\" said Amy Chen, a 27-year-old physiotherapist who visited the Shanghai store this week to switch to Huawei's top-end Pura 70 Ultra from the iPhone 15 Pro in hopes of better mobile reception.\n\nApple has 47 stores in mainland China. Huawei, which did not open a flagship store until 2019, now has 11 of them.\n\n\"I think they will open more than 20 of them. Then it will eventually catch up to Apple,\" said Ethan Qi, associate director at research firm Counterpoint.\n\nIt marks a stark contrast to 2021 when the company's licensed stores were shuttered across China due to product shortages caused by the U.S. sanctions.\n\nHuawei has since developed its own chips, introduced highly popular 5G-capable products and, according to sources, has started aggressively recruiting dealers in recent months.\n\n\"As Huawei now manages to ship in large quantities, given the good profit margin they could provide, (distributors) have become willing to purchase Huawei devices again,\" Qi said. \"Previously, many couldn't get stock and their 4G devices didn't sell well.\"\n\nHuawei has been actively bargaining with distributors, touting the above industry average profit margins of its phones and sometimes demanding exclusionary clauses to turn them into its exclusive partners, according to two industry sources.\n\nMore than 5,200 stores licensed to sell Huawei products sprang up through the first 10 months of 2023, with more than half of them in third and fourth-tier cities, according to market research firm GeoQ, helping Huawei expand its army of distribution partners nationwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts renewed marketing push poses a major challenge to Apple, which suffered a 6.6% plunge in iPhone sales in China to 10.8 million in the first quarter, according to IDC data. By contrast, Huawei boosted its smartphone shipments by 110% to 11.7 million in the first quarter and overtook Apple as the No.2 smartphone vendor in China.\n\nHuawei and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPREMIUM PUSH\n\nLucas Zhong, an analyst at research firm Canalys, said Huawei had plans to build out its flagship stores since 2020 but the progress was slowed by the U.S. sanctions, which led to a much slower iteration of its high-end products.\n\nThere are still supply chain issues leading to shortages of specific models, but they are under much better control and the new phones are garnering good reviews. That means Huawei is now putting its focus squarely on selling premium products that compete with Apple, according to analysts.\n\nIts latest Pura 70 Ultra smartphone, for example, starts at 9,999 yuan ($1,300), matching the price tag of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, while Samsung and Xiaomi are keeping prices for their premium models lower amid soft market demand.\n\nHuawei's luxurious flagship stores display premium products ranging from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, televisions and even electric vehicles made in partnership with Chinese automakers.\n\n\"Huawei now has a long product line,\" Qi said. \"They need big demo areas… They will have to do it themselves because their distributors don't have the capability to rent such a massive area.\"\n\nThe push to build more of its own stores also underscores Huawei's heavy reliance on offline sales. Between 70% and 80% of Huawei's sales come from physical stores, while Apple sees about 40% of its sales coming from online, according to Toby Zhu, another analyst at Canalys.\n\n\"Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are all being affected (by Huawei's comeback),\" Zhu said, referring to other Chinese smartphone makers. \"But for now, the biggest impact has been on Apple.\"\n\nAnd the impact is beginning to be felt beyond mainland China.\n\nSimon Lam, owner of a popular smartphone shop named Trinity Electronics in Hong Kong, said more independent smartphone shops had started selling Huawei devices in recent months.\n\n\"Everybody is stocking up on some Huawei right now. Some more, some less,\" he said. \"People are willing to pay a lot of money for high-end Huawei, something other brands really can't compare with.\"\n\n($1 = 7.2259 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

That means Huawei is now putting its focus squarely on selling premium products that compete with Apple, according to analysts.\n\nIts latest Pura 70 Ultra smartphone, for example, starts at 9,999 yuan ($1,300), matching the price tag of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, while Samsung and Xiaomi are keeping prices for their premium models lower amid soft market demand.\n\nHuawei's luxurious flagship stores display premium products ranging from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, televisions and even electric vehicles made in partnership with Chinese automakers.\n\n\"Huawei now has a long product line,\" Qi said. \"They need big demo areas… They will have to do it themselves because their distributors don't have the capability to rent such a massive area.\"\n\nThe push to build more of its own stores also underscores Huawei's heavy reliance on offline sales. Between 70% and 80% of Huawei's sales come from physical stores, while Apple sees about 40% of its sales coming from online, according to Toby Zhu, another analyst at Canalys.\n\n\"Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are all being affected (by Huawei's comeback),\" Zhu said, referring to other Chinese smartphone makers. \"But for now, the biggest impact has been on Apple.\"\n\nAnd the impact is beginning to be felt beyond mainland China.\n\nSimon Lam, owner of a popular smartphone shop named Trinity Electronics in Hong Kong, said more independent smartphone shops had started selling Huawei devices in recent months.\n\n\"Everybody is stocking up on some Huawei right now. Some more, some less,\" he said. \"People are willing to pay a lot of money for high-end Huawei, something other brands really can't compare with.\" ($1 = 7.2259 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warren Buffett might be the greatest investor of all time, but he’s not immune from making mistakes. This was on full display at the recent Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) annual meeting, where Buffett disclosed that he had sold the company’s entire stake in Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) at a substantial loss.\n\nAlthough the exact loss wasn’t disclosed, Buffett said: “I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision. It was 100% my decision, and we’ve sold it all and we lost quite a bit of money.” The Paramount blunder is the latest bad investment that Buffett has made in the course of a career that spans more than 50 years. What’s nice about Buffett is that he is quick to admit a mistake, correct it, and share what he has learned.\n\nDespite his overall track record of success, Buffett is human like the rest of us and prone to bad decisions when it comes to stocks. Here is Warren Buffet’s blunders: three investments even the Oracle regrets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nThroughout much of his career, Buffett has been criticized for not investing in high-growth technology stocks. He has admitted that his avoidance of the tech sector has cost Berkshire Hathaway and its shareholders some big gains. Buffett still chastises himself for not investing in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The Oracle of Omaha has made up some ground in this area by going all in on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nThough he recently trimmed his position in AAPL stock, it remains Berkshire’s biggest position, accounting for 40% of the equity portfolio. However, before he started buying Apple shares in earnest during 2018, Buffett made a costly bet on legacy tech firm IBM (NYSE:IBM). In November 2011, Buffett bought 64 million shares of IBM at an average price of $170, giving Berkshire a $10.7 billion stake in the tech giant.\n\nSeven years later, Buffett sold the entire IBM holding after enduring six years of mounting sales declines and watching as the stock’s price fell to $140 a share. This led to Berkshire incurring a nearly 20% loss on its IBM investment. Fortunately for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett quickly pivoted from IBM to Apple, and the rest is history.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Statue of Disney's (DIS) Mickey Mouse in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com\n\nParamount Global isn’t the first entertainment stock that Buffett counts as an investment blunder. Early in his career, Buffett made a huge mistake by selling his holding in Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS). Back in 1966, Buffett met with Walt Disney himself, who was then expanding the Disneyland theme park in California. At the time, Disney was known for its one theme park and a couple dozen animated movies. Sentiment towards DIS stock on Wall Street was indifferent.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett apparently liked Walt Disney and the company’s pristine balance sheet. He took a 5% stake in the company, buying $4 million of DIS stock. A year later, Buffett sold his entire stake in Disney for $6 million, netting a 50% ($2 million) profit. The Disney investment may have been profitable, but Buffett earned peanuts compared to what he would have made had he held on. Today, Buffett’s 5% stake in Disney would be worth $10 billion based on the current share price.\n\nBuffett also would have earned more than $1 billion worth of dividend payments over the years had he let DIS stock ride. Maybe this is why Buffett now says his “favorite holding period is forever.”\n\nConocoPhillips (COP) Oil Stocks ConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nThe price someone pays for a stock matters. Buying at the top of the market is never a good idea. Yet that is the mistake Buffett made in 2008 when he bought a big stake in oil and natural gas producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). Buffett bought 79.9 million shares of ConocoPhillips when crude oil prices were trading near $100 a barrel. It turned out to be the peak for energy prices.\n\nCrude oil fell amid the 2008/09 financial crisis and COP stock fell alongside it. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway ended up reporting a $1.5-billion loss for the first-quarter of 2009 as it wrote down its ConocoPhillips investment. At the time, it was the biggest quarterly loss in Berkshire’s history. Buffett called the investment a major mistake and swiftly sold 40% of the ConocoPhillips holding. By 2013, Buffett had completely exited COP stock.\n\nIn this case, Buffett appears to have gotten caught up in an energy rally that took place in 2007 and 2008. Buffett has had a love/hate relationship with oil stocks throughout his career, praising their valuations while complaining about the volatility in energy markets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GOOGL.

        "content": "Dividend stocks like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are gaining momentum following major technology companies announcing their first-ever dividends this year. Americans are also starting to prefer dividend equities during the current inflation storm and expectations of a higher-for-longer scenario. In this environment affordable stocks that pay high dividends are in the limelight.\n\nWe recently covered some of the best high-yield penny dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Uniti Group Inc (NASDAQ:UNIT), a notable name in the REIT industry, is our topic in this list.\n\nUniti Group Inc (NASDAQ:UNIT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nArkansas-based REIT Uniti Group Inc (NASDAQ:UNIT) provides communications infrastructure, fiber and wireless solutions, owning about 140,000 fiber route miles and 8.5 million fiber strand miles in the US. It is one of the highest yielding dividend stocks popular among hedge funds, with a 15% yield.\n\nInsider Monkey's proprietary database of 933 hedge funds shows that 17 funds had stakes in Uniti Group Inc (NASDAQ:UNIT) as of the end of 2023.\n\nPaul Singer's Elliott Management, Thomas Lenox Kempner's Davidson Kempner, Howard Marks' Oaktree Capital Management and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group are some of the top hedge fund shareholders of the company.\n\nHowever, unlike Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Uniti is a small company with low hedge fund sentiment.\n\nEarlier this month, the company talked about its dividend policy and future expectations during its earnings call:\n\n\"Including the dividend we declared yesterday, we will have distributed dividends totaling $0.45 per share for the 2024 tax year, which is more than our current estimated minimum required distribution. As a result, and given that the new business will have substantial value accretive internal uses for our capital, we’ll be suspending our common dividend going forward.\n\nHowever, we will consider reinstating a common dividend in the future as appropriate. Please turn to Slide 7. We believe that having an owned, scaled fiber network has material, competitive, and financial advantages. This is particularly true when you’re a first mover into Tier 2 and 3 markets by building and operating fiber with a true insurgent go-to-market approach. We’ve proven this consistently with our predictable mid-single-digit growth in our Uniti fiber and leasing businesses over the past few years. By combining our fully-owned 57,000 route mile Kinetic network with the Kinetic OpCo business targeting 4.3 million households, we’re now expanding the successful strategy into fiber-to-the-home. Importantly, we expect that the combined company’s current operating plan will be fully funded and that we will have the ability to expand the fiber-to-the-home build by up to 1 million additional households in our existing markets.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Uniti Group Inc (NASDAQ:UNIT) Really The Best High-Dividend Penny Stock?\n\nInsider Monkey's research shows that Uniti Group is not the best high-dividend penny stock right now according to Insider Monkey’s research.

        "content": "Some investors favor blue-chip stocks that often provide the safest, most stable investments. Companies deemed blue-chip stocks have a long history of consistently excellent performance, profits and great dividends.\n\nIf you want to find the best blue-chip stocks to buy and make excellent, sure profits in the long term, look no further. These three stocks are giants within their respective industries. They’ve shown resilience to economic fluctuation and boast some of the most profitable and stable growth histories within stocks.\n\nWe’ll detail the services and products that make these stocks so profitable and the reasons their business models allow them to withstand the test of time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlackstone (BX) A sign for Blackstone (BX) hangs on a white wall.\n\nSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackstone (NYSE:BX) is the most significant player in the competitive alternative asset management industry. It manages over $1 trillion in assets, including 12,500 real estate assets and private equity, in a diverse list of over 230 companies.\n\nBX charges a fee to the owners of the assets it manages. And that fee increases along with the total assets that Blackstone manages. Growth and acquisitions mean more money for Blackstone. It has made exponential strides over the last 10 years but faced some economic headwinds due to rising interest rates.\n\nAlso, the company has increased its assets by billions in the last few years alone. In the first quarter of this year, Blackstone reported net accrued performance revenues of $6.1 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be distributed to shareholders. Real estate was the only section of Blackstone’s asset performance that took a hit, while the rest continued to improve.\n\nTherefore, investors can feel confident about buying Blackstone at the reasonable valuation it holds right now. The stock is consistent and shows little to no sign of risk to impede the long-term profits that you can receive holding this stock.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nAs one of the most profitable companies, little needs to be said for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Mainstream consumers of almost all ages and backgrounds use Apple’s products and services, and the company continues to innovate and push the boundaries of technology.\n\nWhile Apple has seen more volatility than other blue-chip stocks, it has powered through and consistently set new heights. AAPL has some of the most popular electronics, such as iPhones, iPads and watches. iPhones alone reached revenue of $231.3 billion in 2023.\n\nIn addition to its explosively popular electronics, Apple has seen wild success from its services so far this year. Streaming services like Apple TV and Apple Music have been consistently growing in popularity. In fact, they set a new record in revenue in Q2 of this year, reaching $90.8 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple reported an EPS beat with a .66% increase in EPS, reaching quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53. The company’s global popularity and projected continued growth make it an excellent blue chip stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nMarsh & McLennan Companies (MMC) Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment concept\n\nSource: Tendo / Shutterstock\n\nMarsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE:MMC) is an international advisory company for companies worldwide. The company specializes in insurance and acts as an advisor and broker to help clients obtain the necessary policies. The most significant benefit of Marsh & McLennan is its inherent ability to thrive in economic pitfalls.\n\nBusinesses always seek ways to protect their assets and avoid harmful liabilities in regular and unpredictable environments. Insurance will always be necessary, meaning Marsh & McLennan will have a consistent roster of clients for the foreseeable future. In addition to steady income, insurance provides the additional benefit of increased profitability during times of high inflation.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Marsh & McLennan prospered during last year’s inflation hike. The company reported $14 billion in revenue in 2023 and will likely continue its double-digit growth this year.\n\nMarsh & McLennan is a model blue-chip stock with solid, consistent growth and profits that will surely create excellent long-term returns for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) unveiled a slew of generative AI products at its Google I/O developer conference on Tuesday, including its Gemini Live assistant, updates for its Android and Workspaces platforms, and an overhaul of its flagship Search product.\n\nThe announcements are part of Google’s broader effort to reestablish itself as Silicon Valley’s AI leader after it was caught off guard by Microsoft’s (MSFT) partnership with OpenAI in 2022.\n\nThe new products also come a day after OpenAI unveiled its GPT-4o AI model and days before rivals Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) debut their own major generative AI updates.\n\nThe biggest announcement is that Google is updating its Search platform to include generative AI results at the top of the screen. The feature, which was originally available as part of a preview in the company's Search Labs, is now coming to all U.S. users, and rolling out globally in the coming future.\n\nAnother one of the biggest announcements was a new, personalized AI assistant called Gemini Live. The feature, powered by the company’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, will allow you to speak directly to the assistant on your mobile device, providing you with responses in a number of natural-sounding voices.\n\nOn the Android front, Google says it's expanding Gemini the assistant to interact with apps like Google Messages and Gmail, allowing users, for example, to drag and drop generated images from Gemini into texts and emails. Users can also use the app to ask specific questions about YouTube videos, and it will scour the video's captions to find an answer.\n\nGoogle is also updating its on-device version of Gemini, called Gemini Nano, with new multimodal features. Multimodal means that a generative AI model can work across mediums including text, images, and video.

Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nGoogle’s VP of engineering for Gemini experiences, Amar Subramanya, told Yahoo Finance he’s been using Gemini Live for brainstorming ideas and bouncing ideas off of the assistant. Subramanya said early testers have also been using Gemini Live for scenarios including acting as a translator.\n\nIn the coming months, Google says Gemini Live will be able to access a user's cameras, allowing the assistant to interact with the real world and things it sees. OpenAI has also shown off these capabilities in demos of its GPT-4o.\n\nIn one example, Subramanya said he asked the assistant to find a recipe for a pineapple upside-down cake for 15 people and add the ingredients to his Keep shopping list. The assistant found a recipe for 8 people, changed the proportions from 8 to 15 people, and put the items Subramanya needed to put it together into his shopping list.\n\nStory continues\n\nGemini Nano, meanwhile, permeates different parts of Android.\n\nFor instance, Gemini will now provide audio descriptions of on-screen images in the TalkBack accessibility software, which Google says will help address the problem of unlabeled images people with vision problems run into online and in messages from friends and family.\n\nGemini Nano can also detect if you’re speaking to a potential scammer on the phone.\n\nThe company says it does this by picking up “conversation patterns commonly associated with scams.\" Google says all of the processing for scam detection happens on your phone, and conversations aren’t uploaded to the web.\n\nAs for Google’s Workspace, the company says it is bringing its more powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model to its side panel in Workspace apps.\n\nThe option allows you to continue working in an app like Docs or Gmail and use Gemini at the same time in a smaller side panel. Google says Gemini 1.5 Pro is capable of referencing larger data sets, so if you’re using it in Gmail it can summarize information from a greater number of emails.\n\nGemini for Workspace in the Gmail mobile app, meanwhile, can summarize email threads, making them easier to read on a smaller screen, provide contextual smart replies based on the contents of an email, and search for specific information in a long-buried email.\n\nGoogle now has just a few days before its biggest rivals launch their own AI products.\n\nMicrosoft is likely to announce updates to its AI-powered Copilot for Microsoft 365 productivity suite, at its Build conference, which kicks off May 20, while Apple will debut a new generative AI-powered version of its Siri voice assistant at its WWDC event on June 10, according to the New York Times.\n\nNow, we’ll wait to see if they’ll steal Google's thunder.

        "title": "3 Retail Stocks Most at Risk of the New Cautious Consumer Trend",
        "content": "With consumer spending trends tightening and the average U.S. wage stagnating, investors should watch out for retail stocks at risk of a plunge. According to Deloitte Insights, 73% of consumers are still relatively concerned about the rising costs of goods and services. There is a general uneasiness around inflation, the cost of rent and the expensive nature of groceries and necessities.\n\nUltimately, this has driven consumers to reconsider what they spend their money on, which will undoubtedly impact the retail companies that sell non-essential items to the average person. Furthermore, this trend could also impact retailers who rely on a premium shopping experience to attract customers. In these cases, the retailer may upcharge on necessities to improve aesthetics and overall offerings. Thus, investors should keep an eye on the companies that no longer provide competitive value to average consumers.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent buybacks helped Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock out of its most recent slump, but consumer reactions to its new iPad commercial could give clues about broader attitudes towards the company’s products. The ad shows a collection of instruments, machines, cameras and other things that creatives hold dear being crushed by a massive hydraulic press. Though the ad is undoubtedly creative, it’s genuinely uncomfortable to watch and received an unending wave of negative reactions on social media.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo what does this mean for Apple? Well, consumer backlash against an ad won’t do much. But it does show that people care less about the product and more about the message from a company. The message Apple used to deliver was one of unending innovation, with each product generation being so much better than the last that you just had to upgrade or miss out.\n\nToday, there’s little difference between Apple devices from year to year, which resulted in an 11% drop in Mac sales and a 15% drop in iPad sales last year. Time will tell if Apple will regain its sales momentum.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce renowned for its extensive selection of electronics and great customer service, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) has struggled with many of its underperforming store locations. In fiscal year 2024, which ended Jan. 31, 2024, the company closed 24 of its locations while still managing to keep revenue growing thanks to the holiday shopping season. Now in its fiscal year 2025, the company expects to close another 10-15 locations. The reason? A lack of a compelling shopping experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would consumers, who are already hunting for the best deals, choose to shop at Best Buy? After all, with how competitive the online retail market has become, a traditional warehouse model like the kind Best Buy offers simply isn’t convenient. There are still some advantages to being able to go and see a device in person before buying it, but even Best Buy knows it needs to adapt.\n\nNow the company is pivoting towards a more modern and streamlined shopping experience while planning to discontinue many of its less profitable offerings. Yet, Best Buy could still be one of the retail stocks at risk until it finds its edge again.\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nOften considered the more premium alternative to larger supermarkets, Target’s (NYSE:TGT) one-stop-shop model used to be incredibly competitive. Many shoppers swore by the company’s in-house brands while still having a vast array of brand-name products to choose from on its shelves. Furthermore, Target stores were known for being cleaner, safer and overall more attractive to shoppers of a higher socioeconomic standing.\n\nHowever, due to rising retail theft in major U.S. urban centers such as New York, San Franciso, Seattle and Portland, the company had to shutter nine of its locations last year in October. This concerning trend is a result of the district attorneys within those cities choosing not to prosecute theft, emboldening criminals to steal and resell Target’s merchandise online.\n\nEven worse for Target, consumers may choose to shop at its rivals like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) instead for more competitive prices in a time where the shopping experience matters less than saving money. This may ultimately place TGT among retail stocks at risk of a loss.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Wall Street was upbeat last week with the S&P 500 adding 1.9%, the Dow Jones advancing 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1%. Most importantly, the Dow Jones just had its best week of 2024. On Friday, the Dow secured its eighth consecutive session of gains.\n\nWhile most of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, the Dow rally was mainly driven by Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\n\nAs far as the company-specific news are concerned, Apple drew attention. The company unveiled a new lineup of iPads for the first time in two years. The tech giant launched two new versions of its top-end iPad Pro models and two new versions of its mid-tier iPad Air. It also debuted the Apple Pencil Pro stylus and an updated Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Pro line.\n\nAmong US economic data points, we received a downbeat consumer sentiment data. Sentiment dropped to a six-month low. The University of Michigan Survey of Consumers sentiment index for May posted an initial reading of 67.4 for the month, down from 77.2 in April and well below the Dow Jones consensus call for 76.\n\nFed officials reaffirmed the stance for higher rates for a longer period. Policymaker Neel Kashkari signaled that rates are likely to stay at historic highs for a while. Boston Fed President Susan Collins further supported this notion, saying it will take longer \"than previously thought\" to bring inflation down (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024).\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. companies are having their best earnings season in nearly two years. With 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 having already reported, the index is on track to record 5% growth in first-quarter earnings per share per FactSet, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis is the biggest year-over-year increase since the second quarter of 2022 and higher than 3.2% growth that analysts had expected prior to the start of the season (read: Time to Tap Wall Street ETFs on Earnings Strength?).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning ETFs of last week.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nMiners\n\niShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF SLVP – Up 8.7%\n\nVanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ – Up 6.7%\n\nU.S. treasury yields remained subdued for most of the week. This has boosted the strength of the gold and silver bullion. As the mining stocks act as leveraged plays of the underlying metal, leveraged miners topped the return scoreboard in the last week.\n\nShipping\n\nSonicShares Global Shipping ETF BOAT – Up 7.7%\n\nStory continues\n\nShipping companies have been the best performing stocks lately, as the re-routing of vessels following attacks in the Red Sea boosted freight rates.\n\nIndustrials\n\nFirst Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF AIRR – Up 5.8%\n\nLower interest rates prevailed last week helped sectors that depend on huge borrowings. The underlying Richard Bernstein Advisors American Industrial Renaissance Index measures the performance of small and mid-cap US companies in the industrial and community banking sectors.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nUnited States Natural Gas Fund LP UNG – Up 5.4%\n\nNatural gas prices are hovering around a 14-week high, driven by a combination of supply and demand factors that are beginning to trim the storage surplus.  The underlying Natural Gas Price Index is the futures contract on natural gas as traded on the NYMEX.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Metaverse Moguls: 3 Stocks Poised to Dominate the Virtual Realm",
        "content": "The Metaverse was once thought to be the next iteration of the internet. However, after billions of dollars of investments from tech companies, the Metaverse has yet to live to its full potential. Still, the largest tech companies in the world continue to invest in the Metaverse in hardware and software. It’s surprising how advanced the technology has become in just a few short years. As investors, the best investments are made in the early, undercover ideas that others may not fully understand. Here are three Metaverse stocks to buy for those interested in the opportunity and possibility of the Metaverse.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a no-brainer as one of the top Metaverse stocks to buy after changing its name from Facebook to Meta in 2021. As of May 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap and one of only seven companies worth more than $1 trillion. How does Wall Street feel about Meta? In April, 53 of 62 analyst recommendations were a Buy or Strong Buy rating. Additionally, its average price target of $516.13 is nearly $40 higher than its current price of $476.20.\n\nSince 2020, the Reality Labs department at Meta has lost over $45 billion. While CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that spending will decline on the Metaverse, Reality Labs will continue to operate. Products like the Oculus AR/VR goggles and brand new Rayban Meta Smart Glasses have demonstrated their commitment to the Metaverse. Meta also sees an opportunity to expand to enterprise solutions and collaboration tools.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter gaining 37.5% in 2024, Meta’s stock remains cheap on a price multiple basis. Shares trade at just 8.8x sales and 24.1x forward earnings while maintaining an impressive 32% revenue CAGR over the past ten years. Even beyond its Metaverse potential, Meta is a company that is firing on all cylinders and shareholders can count on being richly rewarded.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a name that needs no introduction. It is the second-largest company in the world, next to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Of the 38 analyst recommendations received in May, the stock has 32 Buy or Strong Buy ratings. The average analyst price target of $202.36 also represents a strong 10% upside from the current price.\n\nWith the launch of its VisionPro Headset earlier this year, Apple jumped headfirst into AR/VR. VisionPro only adds to Apple’s strong hardware base, with more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide as of February 2024. With the headset on, users can operate most applications from the Apple ecosystem in real-time virtual reality. From messaging to streaming videos to Facetiming friends worldwide, VisionPro gives a small taste of Apple’s long-term plans in the Metaverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple stock is trading at a relatively reasonable 7.4x sales and 27.9x forward earnings. After dipping its toe into the Metaverse and recently committing to building data center chips for AI, investors should look to Apple as a company that may be on the cusp of its next big growth story.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) Is Autodesk Stock Still A Buy At New Highs? 3 Pros, 3 Cons\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a tech company that builds software platforms for architecture and design. Analysts remain bullish on the stock despite ADSK returning a loss of about 7.0% this year. As a testament to this, the average analyst price target of $287 represents about 30% upside from its current price and the street-high price target of $320 is nearly 50% higher.\n\nThis company utilizes the Metaverse as a way for users to design and model buildings in virtual reality. Using the Metaverse, Autodesk allows for greater remote collaboration and a more precise simulation. In this way, Autodesk is one company that uses Metaverse to improve efficiencies and productivity for the users of its software platforms.\n\nDue to its underperformance this year, Autodesk is trading at more attractive and depressed multiples. With shares trading at just 8.5x sales, its P/S ratio is nearly the lowest it has ever been in the past five years. While Autodesk doesn’t get the coverage that Meta and Apple get, you can bet on it as a well-run software company that will only continue maintaining its 16% five-year revenue CAGR.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "OpenAI’s leap forward in human-like AI assistants underscores Apple’s growing peril",
        "content": "Sam Altman promised ahead of OpenAI’s big announcement yesterday that the company would be revealing something that “feels like magic to me.” While I can’t speak for Altman in terms of what he perceives as magical, the new GPT-4o model certainly is impressive.\n\nI’ll leave it to my AI-specialist colleagues to analyze what’s going on under the hood, but for the general public, GPT-4o seems set to be the first model that really comes across like a human in out-loud conversation. The persona OpenAI showed off in its demos was perhaps cloyingly over-familiar—creepy, even—but it’s a darn good simulacrum of a person, partly because it can handle text, vision, and audio all at once and at speed.\n\nThis is where virtual assistants get real—or at least realistic enough to start being justifiably lumped in with the likes of Samantha, the assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her. Altman himself made the comparison in an X post after the announcement. Sure, Samantha may have [SPOILER ALERT] abandoned the film’s lovelorn protagonist at the end of that story, but who cares? This is about the technical achievement, right?\n\nOnly it isn’t. We have now crossed into the territory of potential seduction, and I don’t mean that in a romantic sense. A realistic text conversation with an AI is impressive and in some cases useful, but a realistic voice, paired with the ability to perceive the user’s appearance and environment, is something else. This is technology that will be able to convincingly influence and cajole the user, and its arrival means we will have to pay very close attention to the compulsions of the entity behind the voice.\n\nAs I have previously written, I would very much like to see virtual assistants that really work for us—reliable and discreet agents that can do stuff on our behalf, acting only in our interests. They would ideally be open-source, so we could verify their security and privacy promises, but they would also need to be on-device assistants that do not need the cloud to function.\n\nLet’s see what Google announces later today at its I/O developer conference—an AI-powered mobile assistant called Pixie is rumored to be on the list—but, as things stand, the most likely company to realize the sort of assistant I’ve been dreaming of is Apple.\n\nAt next month’s WWDC developer event, Apple will be showing off its own AI advances, which according to the New York Times will include an “improved Siri [that Apple will pitch as being] more private than rival A.I. services because it will process requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThat sounds like a lot of what I’ve been waiting for, minus the open-source part. However, it remains to be seen to what degree, and in what way, Apple will meet the moment.\n\nApple is behind in the AI game, to the extent that its desire to catch up reportedly played a big role in its decision to abandon its self-driving car efforts. Making Siri smarter will, given Siri’s current dumb-as-a-rock-ness, not be overly difficult. But Apple’s new assistant won’t just have to excel within the paradigm of Apple’s existing offerings—it will need to provide an impressive alternative to the latest and greatest virtual assistants, and OpenAI just set the bar very high indeed.\n\nNow, Apple is reportedly in intense talks to have OpenAI’s technology power some of the iPhone’s incoming chatbot features. (Google’s Gemini is apparently still another option.) If these talks bear fruit, it’s as yet unclear whether we’ll be looking at Siri plus another chatbot, or a Siri that uses Apple’s on-device model to deal with certain private stuff, and an external model to handle other tasks—I’m really not sure how that would work.\n\nBut if Apple doesn’t have something truly special to show at WWDC, it runs the risk of other companies’ assistants becoming the stars of the show on iOS. And as those assistants gradually become iPhone users’ agents, interacting with online services on their behalf, the value of iOS and its ecosystem would be greatly diminished. Add to that the threat that antitrust regulators are posing to the lucrativeness of the App Store, and it’s easy to see how precarious Apple’s position has suddenly become.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Cheap Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is rapidly gaining traction, and investors are scrambling to get in on the action with cheap metaverse stocks. As technology continues to advance, the concept of a fully immersive, interconnected virtual world is becoming increasingly tangible. These cheap metaverse stocks should be on every investors’ radar.\n\nAlthough the technology so far has not met many investors’ expectations, I feel that we are just beginning to tap into the potential of the industry. We are using ‘metaverse-like’ technologies increasingly in our everyday lives: from cryptocurrencies to NFTs to VR/AR and much more. It could be a matter of time before these brands lift off to new heights, thus making them comparably undervalued.\n\nSo for this article, here are seven cheap metaverse stocks for investors to buy for May. I believe that these brands will be strong performers in the future, and therefore won’t stay cheap for much longer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) operates a platform where users can create and play games. It has a vast user base and continues to focus on monetization strategies and partnerships, such as those with high-profile brands for advertising.\n\nThis year, RBLX has set a financial guidance with expected bookings of approximately $4.03 billion, up from analysts’ expectations of $3.98 billion, and aims for an adjusted EBITDA of around $490 million. The company plans to cap its capital expenditures related to infrastructure at about $100 million and anticipates a share dilution between 3% and 4%.\n\nAdditionally, RBLX is targeting a yearly growth in bookings of over 20% from 2025 to 2027, with an improvement in margins of 100 to 300 basis points annually over the same period​.\n\nLooking back at 2023, RBLX reported significant financial metrics including a 38% year-over-year increase in revenue for the third quarter, reaching $713.2 million. Despite these gains, the company reported a net loss of $277.2 million for the quarter.\n\nTrading at just 6.7 times sales, RBLX could be one of those undervalued metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is a leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Unity basically provides some of the “picks and shovels” that allow the metaverse to come to life.\n\nThis year,  the company aims to support creators across the entire game development cycle with new AI features and a first look at Unity 6. They are also launching Unity Cloud, a platform aimed at broadening the usability of Unity’s tools in cloud environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also provided a financial outlook for 2024, projecting revenues between $1.76 billion to $1.80 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $425 million.\n\nUnity reported strong revenue growth, with a 38% increase year-over-year, and continued to invest in technology that advances its capabilities in real-time 3D content creation.\n\nStocks like U that provide the 3D engines for the metaverse to thrive may become in hot demand in later years, and of course it also benefits from the growth headwinds of the expanding gaming market as well.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for its advanced graphics processing units that are essential for gaming and professional markets, including applications in the metaverse.\n\nNVDA is still my best pick for one of those undervalued metaverse stocks despite its high multiples for both sales and earnings.\n\nFinancially, NVDA has shown robust performance and has projected even stronger outcomes for the upcoming fiscal year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, NVDA expects revenue to be around $24 billion. This guidance exceeds Wall Street expectations.\n\nNVDA trades at 75 times earnings and 36 times sales. However, the expected growth rates for these metrics make them lower on their forward measures, at 39 times earnings and 22 times sales, respectively. This means that although these metrics may be high today, analysts are confident that NVDA’s fundamentals will improve in the future.\n\nThere’s also some potential for NVDA to do a stock split in the coming years, with it trading for nearly $900 per share at the time of writing, which could incur some indirect benefits to investors.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) provides an e-commerce platform that is expanding into the metaverse by enabling new forms of digital commerce and integration of NFTs.\n\nShopify’s metaverse strategy includes enhancing digital fashion, which represents a significant market opportunity projected to reach $50 billion by 2030. Digital fashion on Shopify allows for the creation of 3D clothing and accessories that are more sustainable and cost-effective.\n\nFinally, Shopify’s President has expressed optimism about the future of retail in the metaverse, emphasizing the importance of integrating commerce features into online platforms.\n\nAs one of the most popular web store builders, SHOP is positioning itself well to take advantage of the rising tide of metaverse products for store owners to tap into, potentially selling them on sites such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nAnalysts are very optimistic about SHOP’s near-term financial performance for FY2024, anticipating that its EPS will rise 944.33% to 1.04 this year. This then makes SHOP one of those undervalued metaverse stocks to consider.\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) An image of a person wearing a VR headset looking up, a nebulous digital cloud in the upper corner\n\nSource: Vit-Mar/Shutterstock\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:VERS) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in companies heavily involved in the metaverse sector.\n\nThe financial data for VERS reveals an asset total of $5.74M, with a relatively low expense ratio of 0.58%, and a P/E ratio of 25.42. The fund distributes a dividend yield of 0.69% with an annual dividend of $0.28 per share and maintains a conservative payout ratio of 17.44%. It has shown strong performance with a 1-year return of 24.81%.\n\nKey stock holdings of the fund include leading tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) 4.97%, Nvidia 4.60%, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 4.55%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 4.55%, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 4.38%.\n\nI think that VERS could be one of those undervalued picks for investors to consider if they’d like to invest in a broad-basket of metaverse stocks. It may go well with people who are particularly bullish on the sector, and its intersectionality with AI and robotics could further the bull case.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastly (NYSE:FSLY) operates an edge cloud platform, which is crucial for delivering content with reduced latency. In addition to U, it’s one of those companies that provided the crucial infrastructure to make the metaverse a possibility.\n\nFSLY has issued guidance for 2024, forecasting total revenue to range between $555 million and $565 million. This represents a slight decrease from earlier projections of up to $585 million due to pricing pressures.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Fastly reported a positive operating cash flow of $11.1 million and continues to focus on optimizing operations despite a non-GAAP operating loss.\n\nI still believe that FSLY is an undervalued option for investors. For one, analysts have given the stock a 69.29% predicted upside from its current level. Its EPS also set to surge in the triple digits from FY2026 to FY2027, thus making it comparatively undervalued on an EPS basis.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) A concept image of the metaverse with two young adults wearing virtual reality headsets. undervalued metaverse stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it’s becoming increasingly involved in the metaverse through its NFT marketplace.\n\nThis platform supports NFTs on the Ethereum (ETH-USD) blockchain and aims to introduce more blockchains in the future.\n\nCoinbase has also introduced a mobile DApp browser and a DeFi wallet, enhancing user interaction with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading. This includes a co-custodial hot wallet setup.\n\nHowever, in its first quarter of 2024, Coinbase experienced some challenges, notably a consensus revenue estimate reduction of 14%.\n\nStill, I am firmly bullish on COIN’s long-term prospects, and I also think that this year will be the one where cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shine, especially since many FAANG stocks could be seen as too overvalued for most investors’ tastes.\n\nCOIN could then be one of those undervalued metaverse stocks for investors to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Another streaming bundle: Comcast's Peacock to partner with Netflix, Apple TV+",
        "content": "Consumers will soon have access to yet another streaming bundle. Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Brian Roberts said early Tuesday that later this month, the company will launch a new offering that combines its Peacock platform, Netflix (NFLX), and Apple TV+ (AAPL).\n\nThe new bundle, referred to as StreamSaver, will be available to customers of Comcast’s broadband internet service, the executive revealed at a MoffettNathanson conference.\n\n\"Those three products will come at a vastly reduced price to anything in the market today and be available to all our customers,\" Roberts said. Exact pricing details will be announced at a later date.\n\n\"We've been bundling video successfully and creatively for 60 years,\" he added. \"This is the latest iteration of that, and I think this will be a pretty compelling package.\"\n\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\nOn average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month on them, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. That means fewer opportunities for streamers to retain loyal subscribers over time.\n\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services for years. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.\n\nDisney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.\n\nThe move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, has gained traction recently.\n\nJust last week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Disney (DIS) announced a new streaming bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services, with a launch date set for this summer in the US.\n\nEarlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. And in December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ).\n\nStory continues The NBC and Comcast logo are displayed on top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly known as the GE building, in midtown Manhattan in New York on July 1, 2015.

        "title": "Alphabet AI Event Will Show Whether Blowout Results Were a Fluke",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s recent results raised hopes that the Google parent can still be a big player in artificial intelligence. Now it has a chance to prove it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Biden Accuses China of ‘Cheating’ on Trade, Imposes New Tariffs Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe How One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt\n\nInvestors are hotly anticipating the company’s Google I/O annual developers conference Tuesday, where it’s expected to unveil AI features for its search business and broader ecosystem. Bank of America wrote that the event “could help solidify the case for Google (and the Android ecosystem) as a net AI beneficiary.”\n\nThe event comes a day after a similar one from OpenAI, where it launched a faster and cheaper version of its ChatGPT model. Some high-profile disappointments have raised lingering questions about Alphabet’s ability to compete against Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI despite years of heavy investments.\n\n“Alphabet is in a unique position to show it is making progress, that it can re-right the AI ship, that things aren’t as dire as people thought,” said David Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments. “The results are more than enough to support the stock in the near term, but the event offers an opportunity for an upside surprise, and if it can show off, what better time?”\n\nShares dipped 0.1% on Tuesday.\n\nThe company’s AI position gained new urgency following a report that Apple Inc. has closed in on an agreement with OpenAI to use its technology on the iPhone. Apple has also held talks with Google, the default search engine on the phone, and those discussions are ongoing. Apple will unveil its own AI strategy at an event next month.\n\nLast month’s earnings report showed robust financials — not only did Alphabet beat expectations, but it implemented a dividend and authorized a $70 billion buyback program. Its shares are up 21% this year, and the rally has taken it above the elite $2 trillion market cap threshold. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 8%, while Microsoft has risen about 10%.\n\nAn underwhelming I/O event isn’t expected to reverse that rally, given the strength on display in the results and how Alphabet continues to screen as a bargain among the Magnificent Seven. However, reassuring investors about its position with AI could be a catalyst for additional gains.\n\nThere are some positive signs. Morgan Stanley, citing AlphaWise data, sees accelerating adoption of the company’s Gemini AI engine, and analyst Brian Nowak noted Alphabet’s “still-leading (and expanding) spot at the top of the e-commerce, travel, autos, financial, healthcare funnels.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: An AI-Rally for Software Makers Will Demand Investor Patience\n\nWhile shares are near record levels, Alphabet has been dogged by perceived AI missteps, including with its Gemini image generator earlier this year and a chatbot in 2023. The idea that information derived from AI may not be reliably accurate was seen as a risk, especially for Google, which has a dominant market share in internet search.\n\n“Alphabet will freely admit it has gotten AI wrong, but the important thing is to show it is committed to AI and that it has the resources to be a leader,” said Tim Pagliara, chairman and chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. “It has to show it is making progress while not creating unrealistic expectations for what it can do.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nCompanies are talking less about “artificial intelligence,” a buzzword central to meteoric gains in tech stocks, raising questions about how much of the technology’s benefits may have already been priced in. Mentions of the term on calls this past earnings season have dropped sharply compared to the previous four reporting periods, according to a Bloomberg analysis of S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Stoxx Europe 600 earnings transcripts.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s revenue rose 6.6% after it focused on gaining market share in the twin businesses of e-commerce and the cloud. OpenAI is launching a faster and cheaper version of the artificial intelligence model that underpins its chatbot, ChatGPT, as the startup works to hold on to its lead in an increasingly crowded market. Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s revenue and earnings beat estimates after its TikTok-style video platform gained traction against ByteDance Ltd. and drove growth despite a faltering Chinese economic recovery. Sony Group Corp. predicted sales in the year to March that missed analysts’ estimates, citing waning demand for PlayStation 5 hardware. Foxconn-backed Sharp Corp. is exiting TV panel production and plans to seek volunteers for early retirement, abandoning a business in which it lost out to Chinese rivals. Apple Inc. is preparing to start selling the Vision Pro in markets outside the US, testing whether the $3,499 mixed-reality headset has broader appeal.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nSea Ltd\n\n(Updates shares.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia’s Shifting Exports Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges ‘The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,’ and It’s Already Changing the WNBA\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Magnificent Seven: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Nvidia. ©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters (©Alamy/Getty/AP/Reuters)\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" accounted for around two-thirds of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gains last year, but can they repeat those extraordinary returns this time around?\n\nProfits for the \"Mag 7\" are forecast to rise 38% in the first quarter from a year ago, dwarfing the overall S&P 500’s 2.4% anticipated year-over-year earnings growth, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nThis group of mega-cap tech companies — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — are capitalising on tech growth trends such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2023, Magnificent Seven stocks surged between 48% and 239%, accounting for some 60% of last year's 24% total return for the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s how the mega caps performed this first quarter and what Nvidia is expected to deliver when it reports next week.\n\nTesla (TSLA) — reported 23 April\n\nTesla reported a 9% drop in first-quarter revenue, the biggest decline since 2012, and missed analysts’ estimates, as the electric vehicle company weathers the effect of ongoing price cuts.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) maker said it had made $1.13bn (£910m) over the first three months of the year, compared with $2.51bn a year earlier.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that the company plans to start production of new models in “early 2025, if not late this year,” after previously expecting to begin in the second half of 2025.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Anglo American, GameStop, Vodafone, Greggs and Novavax\n\n“We slightly raised our 2024 deliveries forecast, versus our prior forecast for no growth. Our improved outlook is due to Tesla’s recent price cuts, so we also slightly reduced our near-term automotive gross margin forecast. We think Tesla could cut prices further as management aims to pass along the majority of cost savings to customers to drive demand,” said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) — reported 24 April\n\nMeta beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines with its first quarter earning but a disappointing Q2 forecast gave investors the chills.\n\nTotal revenue rose 27% to $36.5bn and Meta forecast a slight improvement in the current March-June quarter. The Facebook owner reported earnings per share of $4.71 in the quarter.\n\nHowever, looking ahead, Meta says it will see second quarter revenue between $36.5bn and $39bn, falling short of midpoint estimates of $38.24bn.\n\nMeta said it had raised the high end of its full-year capital expenditure guidance from $37bn to $40bn in order to “continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap”. It added that it expected capital expenditures to “continue to increase next year”.\n\nRead more: Meta, Apple are investing in tech that can decode your thoughts\n\nMeta stock has had a strong performance, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than 39% year to date.\n\nHowever, it lost $132bn in market cap after its earnings, and several analysts lowered their target prices following the report. It is the only Mag 7 constituent that has failed to impress markets.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) — reported 25 April\n\nMicrosoft’s heavy bet on AI appears to be paying off as the world’s largest public company reported $61.86bn revenue for the last quarter.\n\nTotal revenue increased 17% to $61.86bn during the first three months of 2024, the third quarter of its financial year, surpassing analyst expectations of some $60.88bn. Earnings per share increased 20% to $2.94, ahead of the expected $2.83.\n\n\"Microsoft’s AI-powered earnings demonstrate that doubling down on innovation is paying off,\" Jeremy Goldman, senior director of briefings at Emarketer, told Reuters, pointing to the company's early moves in generative AI, such as its large investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nRead more: Microsoft to invest €4bn in French cloud and AI services\n\nSales in Microsoft’s cloud division, its biggest revenue driver that includes its Azure computing platform, climbed 21% during the quarter to $26.7bn, compared with analysts’ forecasts for $26.2bn and above company guidance.\n\n“Wide-moat Microsoft continues to deliver with strong third-quarter results, topping both our top- and bottom-line estimates. Results are impressive from most angles, but we highlight strength in AI, Azure, and gaming; a surge in bookings from large Azure deals; and robust margin performance despite downward pressure from the Activision acquisition are our key takeaways,” said Dan Romanoff, equity research analyst at Morningstar.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) — reported 25 April\n\nAlphabet’s first-quarter revenue jumped 15% as Google’s parent company announced its first-ever dividend of 20 cents a share alongside a $70bn (£56bn) stock buyback.\n\nGoogle posted $80.5bn in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and reported $1.89 in earnings per share, up from $1.17 – beating analysts’ expectations on both counts.\n\nThe company also announced its first dividend, of $0.20 per share, and said the payout would become quarterly.\n\n“Our leadership in AI [artificial intelligence] research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation,” CEO Sundar Pichai said in the earnings release.\n\nRead more: Google-backed Anthropic releases Claude chatbot across Europe\n\n“Alphabet is taking a tougher stance on costs than its AI rival, continuing to cut headcount and consolidating teams to blunt the impact of infrastructure investments on profitability. Meanwhile, search advertising increased 14%, YouTube advertising surged 21%, and the cloud business also delivered impressive growth, with revenue up 28%, the best result in more than a year,” according to Michael Hodel at Morningstar.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) — reported 30 April\n\nAmazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, driven by growth in advertising and cloud computing.\n\nThe earnings sent shares of the retail giant up as much as 5% in pre-market trading.\n\nAmazon posted profits of $10.4bn (£8.3bn) in the first three months of 2024, up from $3.2bn during the same period last year.\n\nFirst-quarter sales increased 13% to $143.3bn, driven by strong retail sales in North America and rapid growth across Amazon Web Services (AWS), its digital infrastructure division. Net income more than tripled to $10.4bn in the first quarter.\n\nSales at AWS accelerated 17% in the first quarter to $25bn, topping Wall Street’s forecast for sales growth of 12% to $24.5bn.\n\nThe company expects revenue of $144bn to $149bn for the current quarter ending June.\n\nRead more: Amazon to invest $1.3bn in France, create 3,000 jobs\n\nCEO Andy Jassy told analysts that for Amazon \"there is a big opportunity in front of us\" in servicing AI customers.\n\nAmazon has been expanding its physical footprint in Europe and has just made a commitment to invest €1.2bn in France, which will go toward creating more than 3,000 jobs and increasing the company’s footprint in the country.\n\nFrance has also secured investment from Microsoft, with the mega cap committing €4bn toward expanding its cloud and AI infrastructure in France, in addition to funding AI skilling and support for France’s technology industry. It is pursuing a similar strategy in the UK.\n\nMamta Valechha, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Amazon is a much-loved name with expectations increasing into results given strong performances from other cloud names such as Microsoft and Google. But nevertheless, we have a company producing record profits and using these profits to fund the next leg of growth.\"\n\nAmazon saw its stock surge 81% in 2023 and is betting that generative AI will produce tens of billions in revenue for Amazon Web Services in the next few years.\n\nAmazon aims to be a dominant player in the market despite being slow to invest in this technology.\n\nApple (AAPL) — reported on 2 May\n\nApple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped estimates and announced an expanded stock buyback programme.\n\nApple fell behind in the AI race and while rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Meta spend billions of dollars to support AI infrastructure the iPhone maker is only now making a push.\n\nThe company is reportedly nearing a deal with OpenAI for ChatGPT to power new AI features on the iPhone. Rival Microsoft is one of OpenAi's biggest sponsors.\n\nApple is also said to be in discussions with Google and Anthropic, maker of the Claude AI chatbot, to improve features such as Siri and search.\n\nApple is also reportedly building its own AI chip for data centres, the vast facilities that power chatbots using remote computer servers.\n\nRead more: Apple set to sell Vision Pro headset outside US\n\nThe iPhone maker reported revenue of $90.75bn ($72.22bn) in the first three months of 2024, down 4% from the year before but slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $90.3bn.\n\nSales of its flagship iPhone were down 10% from the year before to $46bn, compared with $51.3bn the previous year, and sales in China fell to $16.3bn for the quarter, against $17.8bn a year ago.<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOG</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL?p=GOOGL&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">GOOGL</a>), Meta (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META?p=META&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">META</a>), and Microsoft (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">MSFT</a>) have pulled ahead, while others, like Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL\\\">AAPL</a>), have faced mounting challenges.</p>\\n<p>Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives joins The Morning Brief<em> </em>to discuss what he calls \\\"the fourth industrial revolution\\\" in AI and Apple's advances on the front.</p>\\n<p>Ives states that Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be paramount for Apple: \\\"I think it's probably the most important event for Apple that we've seen potentially in a decade because this is going to be [CEO Tim] Cook laying out the AI strategy on the services side for developers, what I believe is really the start of an AI app store in terms of how that's going to morph and then its proprietary AI technology in iPhone 16, which will launch in September.\\\"</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:6;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dow-winning-streak-novavax-surges-112547962.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.</p>\\n<p><em>This post was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:7;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/nicholas-jacobino/\\\"><em>Nicholas Jacobino</em></a>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l49M3KSGAJH7T5fNatD2gA--~B/aD0yOTA4O3c9NTE3MzthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/20266780-0ed7-11ef-bff1-511fcaffd304\",\"duration\":\"PT3M52S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/2791272b-63eb-347b-b11f-b19395ba142e.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-catching-ai-revolution-dan-142925403.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"2791272b-63eb-347b-b11f-b19395ba142e\"}\n\nApple reported net income of $23.64bn, or $1.53 per share, down 2% from $24.16bn, or $1.52 per share, in the year-earlier period.\n\nCEO Tim Cook attempted to reassure investors about the state of the business in the world's second largest economy, noting that iPhone sales were actually up in mainland China.\n\n\"I maintain a great view of China in the long term,\" he said.\n\nThe company also announced another $110bn in share buybacks and raised its quarterly dividend by 4%.\n\n“We project 6% compound annual revenue growth for Apple through fiscal 2028. The iPhone will be the greatest contributor to revenue over our forecast, and we project 3% growth for iPhone revenue over the next five years. We expect this to be driven primarily by unit sales growth, with modest pricing increases,” said William Kerwin, analyst at Morningstar.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) — reporting on 22 May\n\nThe AI boom of these tech mega-caps would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia — the last of the Mag 7 to report — can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nNvidia is anticipated to report earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, marking an increase of 403.7% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe earnings are projected to be $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05bn for the entire fiscal year, according to TradingView.\n\nRead more: Nvidia rivals gold as shield against inflation, survey shows\n\nNvidia shares took a hit earlier this week when the investor Stanley Druckenmiller said that he'd slashed his big bet in the chipmaker earlier this year. He said the swift AI boom could be overdone in the short run.\n\nStill, Nvidia is leading the race in the AI \"gold rush\" and a survey revealed that the stock is rivalling gold (GC=F) as a possible hedge against inflation.\n\nGold is still seen as the best safeguard against the risk of rising prices, according to 46% of survey participants. But nearly a third said the tech mega caps are their first pick for the role.\n\nWatch: 'Magnificent 7' should remain strong in 2024 - CIO\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Over the past five years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has risen by 277%, adjusted for a 2020 stock split. But it's also important to note that Apple pays a modest dividend, so assuming reinvestment of all the dividends you received over the past five years, Apple's five-year total return through May 13 was 291%.\n\nSo, if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock five years ago, and had reinvested your dividends along the way, your investment would have grown to about $39,100.\n\nApple vs. the benchmarks\n\nTo put it mildly, this is extraordinary performance. A 291% total return over a five-year period translates to 31% annualized total returns. Meanwhile, the long-term average of the S&P 500 is about 10%.\n\nConsidering just the past five years, here's how Apple's performance compares with the major benchmarks.\n\nCompany/Index 5-Year Total Return Apple 291% Nasdaq 100 150% S&P 500 97% Dow Jones Industrial Average 69%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nWhy has Apple performed so well?\n\nObviously, a lot of factors have contributed to Apple's performance over the past five years -- including 20 quarterly earnings reports, five holiday shopping seasons, numerous new product releases, and much more. In short, there's far too much to cover in a relatively short article.\n\nHaving said that, comparing some of Apple's key metrics from its most recent earnings release with the same metrics from an earnings report five years prior tells us a lot about why Apple has delivered such stellar performance.\n\nMetric Fiscal Q2 2019 Fiscal Q2 2024 % Change Total revenue $58.02 billion $90.75 billion 56.4% Product revenue $46.57 billion $66.89 billion 43.6% Service revenue $11.45 billion $23.87 billion 108% Earnings per share $0.615 $1.53 149% Outstanding shares 18.8 billion 15.5 billion (17.5%)\n\nData source: Apple. Per-share metrics are split-adjusted. Parentheses indicate negative numbers.\n\nThe bottom line is that Apple has produced fantastic returns, but there are some good reasons why -- not hype or explosive growth, but excellent business performance sustained over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $550,688!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nBob Iger is just like you and me — he watches a lot of Netflix (NFLX). But now, the Disney CEO is talking about it.\n\n\"Netflix is, in many respects, the gold standard when it comes to streaming,\" Iger said during the company's quarterly earnings call on May 7.\n\nAnd he's not the only big-shot media exec praising rival platforms either.\n\n\"Disney itself is a fabulous company,\" Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav piped in on Thursday.\n\nAmazon received compliments too, as WBD streaming chief JB Perrette said: \"Obviously, Amazon and Netflix are both incredibly compelling.\"\n\nThose quotes, ripped from the call transcripts of competing media companies this earnings season, make one thing abundantly clear: The streaming giants have called a truce.\n\nIt's no accident that this \"kumbaya\" moment is arriving now. The rules of the game had already been changing. Once upon a time, all Wall Street rewarded was subscriber growth as numerous platforms flooded the market. Profitability? Who cared. Free cash flow? Never heard of her.\n\nThe goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nAt the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. \"Bridgerton\" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal.\n\nOthers soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for \"The Office\" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time. LOS ANGELES, CA - APRIL 18: Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos (L) and Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attend the LACMA 50th Anniversary Gala sponsored by Christie's at LACMA on April 18, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for LACMA) (Charley Gallay via Getty Images)\n\nThen Wall Street started to change its tune. Could streaming — an incredibly cheap way for consumers to access their favorite content at the touch of a button — become an actual business? Investors weren't so sure. The industry scrambled to prove them wrong.\n\nThere were price hikes and password-sharing crackdowns. Ad-supported tiers and mass layoffs. That helped with streaming profitability across the board, although the majority of companies (minus Netflix and WBD) still don't make money in those divisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, partnerships and bundled offerings among competing media companies have become more of a trend in an effort to combat not only profitability challenges but also a more fickle consumer.\n\nLast week, Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a new bundle that will bring together Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming services.\n\nEarlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox (FOXA), set to debut later this fall. In December, WBD partnered with Netflix on a $10 ad-supported bundle offered through Verizon (VZ).\n\nThe competitors' embrace signals a clear shift for the industry as consolidation lurks around the corner with Paramount currently seeking a buyout while WBD has also been at the center of M&A talks after its two-year post-merger lockup period officially ended.\n\nAs David Zaslav put it last week, \"There's more strength together.\" We'll find out soon if that's the case. morning brief image\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Shares of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Warren Buffett's giant conglomerate, have risen by a stunning 4,187,214% since he took the helm of the core business in 1965. If you want to build a portfolio that can grow similarly, you might start by following his lead.\n\nKeeping tabs on what billionaire investors are buying and selling is probably easier than you think. Every three months, Berkshire Hathaway -- and anyone else managing over $100 million -- must submit a 13F filing that discloses their trading activity in the prior quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nA look at Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter report revealed that it held $135.4 billion worth of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock and $39.2 billion worth of Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). These are the two largest positions in Berkshire's equity portfolio, and Wall Street analysts who follow the companies are more than a little bullish about them. Recently updated price targets from a pair of sell-side analysts who follow the businesses suggest their share prices can climb 34% and 17%, respectively, over the next 12 months.\n\nThe case for Apple\n\nIt didn't start out quite that big, but at the end of December, Berkshire's Apple position was worth a whopping $174.3 billion. Then, in the first quarter, Berkshire sold about 13% of its Apple shares.\n\nBuffett famously buys when the market is fearful and sells when it's over-exuberant. Berkshire's recent sale of some Apple shares implies the market's expectations are higher than they should be, but Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, disagrees. Ives recently reiterated his outperform rating and $250 price target on Apple shares.\n\nIves is bullish about Apple because it has been installing advanced chips of its own design in data centers that will handle the processing for AI-powered services. Building superior AI-related services for smartphones and other devices could give Apple's devices a long-term advantage over the competition.\n\nI'd argue that iMessage's lack of accommodation for Android users now is several times more important to Apple's business than any advantage a beefed-up version of Siri might give its devices down the road. Unfortunately for Apple shareholders, green bubble shaming is at the heart of a lawsuit filed in March by the U.S. Department of Justice and 15 states that accuses Apple of abusing its power as a monopoly.\n\nOver the past couple of years, Apple's earnings per share (EPS) have risen slightly, but only because of the company's extensive share repurchases. Trailing-12-month net income has fallen by 0.17% since the beginning of 2022.\n\nStory continues AAPL EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nApple is now trading at around 28.5 times its trailing-12-month earnings per share. This is an extremely high price to pay for an already enormous business that has been reporting stagnating profits.\n\nApple could reach Wedbush's lofty price target, but it isn't a bet I'd recommend to anybody who doesn't have a high risk tolerance. If a revamped Siri bolstered by generative AI features doesn't become a huge growth driver, and if earnings continue to stagnate, investors who buy at current prices could suffer significant losses.\n\nThe case for Bank of America\n\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its Apple holdings in the first quarter, its Bank of America position grew in value to $39.2 billion at the end of March from $34.8 billion as of the end of 2023.\n\nAnalysts at Oppenheimer most likely agree with Berkshire's decision to hold onto its Bank of America shares. Oppenheimer's sell-side division recently lowered its price target on the stock by $1 to $45 per share -- but it was trading between $38 and $39 on Monday.\n\nBank of America's excess liquidity and stable profits encouraged Oppenheimer to maintain its outperform rating. The well-capitalized bank finished March with $197 billion in common tier-one equity. That raised its CET1 ratio to 1.84 percentage points above the regulatory minimum.\n\nBank of America has been a big beneficiary of the higher interest rate environment, and it has been slower than its peers to raise the rates it pays depositors. In the first quarter, net interest income -- the difference between interest paid and interest received -- decreased by just 3% year over year.\n\nAt its recent share prices, investors can scoop up Bank of America stock for about 11.9 times forward earnings expectations. At this reasonable valuation, investors should come out way ahead over the long run, even if the bank's profits stagnate. Plus, its dividend yields 2.5% at the current share price. Put it together, and it looks like even risk-averse investors can confidently add some of this bank's shares to their portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. reported a weaker-than-expected profit as demand for iPhones remained sluggish in China, though it projected significant growth in the current quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows ‘Day One’ Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk’s Cuts Biden Adds Tariffs on Chinese Chips, Critical Minerals, EVs Five Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India\n\nThe Taiwanese company, a key partner to both Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., gave that forecast after reporting its strongest monthly sales since the start of 2023, buoyed by rising demand for servers during the AI boom. It reported net profit of NT$22 billion ($679 million) in the March quarter. While that was up more than 70%, it missed an average estimate for NT$29.1 billion.\n\nThe miss reflects in part the heightened expectations around AI that helped propel Hon Hai’s shares more than 60% higher this year. It’s getting a boost from big investments into AI infrastructure such as datacenters. Company executives maintained the 40% growth outlook for the AI server business this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Japanese subsidiary Sharp Corp. said it’s divesting its camera module and semiconductor business and turning a key display plant in Sakai into an AI datacenter.\n\nHon Hai’s AI business has proven a bright spot in an otherwise struggling operation that remains tied to the smartphone market. Investors hope booming AI demand could help the world’s largest iPhone assembler diversify its business away from Apple, which still accounts for more than half of Hon Hai’s sales.\n\nHon Hai, known also as Foxconn, indicated strong demand for cloud and networking products during the current quarter in presentation materials released before its earnings call. But revenue from consumer electronics should remain broadly flat.\n\nDemand for iPhones fell about 27% in the first three months of 2024 in China, according to official government data, even though Apple said its iPhone business in the Asian nation grew.

        "content": "*\n\nQ1 net profit T$22.01 bln vs T$29.31 bln analysts' forecast\n\n*\n\nFoxconn expects Q2 revenue to grow significantly\n\n*\n\nReaffirms commitment to Sharp, saying \"worst is behind\"\n\n(Recasts, updates comments throughout)\n\nBy Yimou Lee and Faith Hung\n\nTAIPEI, May 14 (Reuters) - Apple supplier Foxconn said on Tuesday it remained confident about strong AI server demand this year driving revenue, and pledged to stand by Japan's Sharp after taking a large, profit-impacting writedown last year.\n\nFoxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and Apple's top iPhone manufacturer, said on an earnings call it expected flat consumer electronics demand, but reiterated it saw significant growth in 2024 revenue given the artificial intelligence (AI) applications boom.\n\n\"The visibility for this year has improved compared to in March, mainly thanks to strong AI server demand,\" company spokesman James Wu told a post-earnings conference call, pointing to a better business outlook but without providing detailed numbers.\n\nFoxconn said it expects revenue for the second quarter to grow significantly from a year earlier, broadly in line with previous guidance, with revenue for smart computer electronics likely to be flattish.\n\nIt also forecast demand for consumer electronics to be flat this year. It does not provide numerical guidance.\n\nFor the first three months of 2024, Foxconn reported a 72% rise in profit coming off a low base from the same period a year earlier, but the growth was lower than expected.\n\nApple's quarterly results and forecast beat modest expectations this month, and CEO Tim Cook said revenue growth would return in the current quarter.\n\nIn a separate statement, Foxconn, whose earnings took a hit last year from a T$17.3 billion ($533.9 million) writedown related to its 34% stake in Sharp Corp, said it was committed to the Japanese electronics maker, describing it as an \"important asset\".\n\n\"The worst is behind Sharp. Its future only gets better from here,\" Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said, adding that the Japanese company's Sakai factory would be transformed into an AI data centre.\n\nLiu did not appear on the earnings call. Foxconn said he was in Europe on a business trip, but did not give details.\n\nThe Taiwanese company, the world's largest contract electronics maker, said net profit for the January-March quarter rose to T$22.01 billion from T$12.8 billion in the same period a year earlier, when earnings were hit by the Sharp writedown.\n\nWhile Foxconn's quarterly profit missed the T$29.31 billion forecast by analysts, it was the firm's third consecutive quarterly profit rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter, consumer electronics including smartphones accounted for 48% of its revenue while cloud and networking products, including servers, contributed 28%.\n\nThe company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in March that it expected a significant rise in revenue this year driven by booming AI server demand.\n\nFoxconn also wants to replicate the success it has had with iPhones with electric vehicles (EV), saying on the call it expected EV sales to be expanded to markets including Southeast Asia, the United States and Europe, though it did not provide a time frame.\n\nWu said recent price cuts for EVs have presented an opportunity for Foxconn, which he said was in talks with some 20 to 30 companies including traditional car makers and start-ups for possible collaboration.\n\n\"That creates opportunities for outsourcing, which is good for Foxconn,\" Wu said, referring to the price cuts.\n\nFoxconn's shares have risen 65% so far this year, driven by its rosy AI outlook, far outperforming a 17% gain for the broader market.

        "title": "PayPal Is Holding Its Ground Amid Clash Of Digital Payment Titans",
        "content": "PayPal Is Holding Its Ground Amid Clash Of Digital Payment Titans\n\nIn recent years, PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been struggling as Big Tech titans, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) expanded its footprint in digital payments. Even Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) is entering the credit card arena. The Robinhood Gold Card pitch is impressive, to say the least, and promises to give both Apple and PayPal a headache. But at the end of April, PayPal showed it is determined to reignite the growth story of its brand offferings while its unbranded businesses continue to grow, as it confidently lifted its full year adjusted profit guidance.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, total payment volumes grew 14% to $403.9 billion on increased global consumer spending that held up amid an uncertain economy. Net revenue climbed 10% to $7.7 billion. Aided by cost cuts, adjusted operating margin improved to 18.2%.\n\nA Lifted Outlook\n\nFor 2024, PayPal guided for adjusted profit growth in in mid-to-high single-digit percentages, while it previously forecasted it will remain flat.\n\nFocus on upgrades in attempt to win back investor support.\n\nPayPal is trying to woo investors by making efforts to become leaner as it focuses on achieving profitable growth. CEO Alex Chriss spoke of PayPal’s work to instill cost discipline, stating that management is “leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs”. While turning things around will likely take time and it is already taking longer than some expected, PayPal feels confident in its long-term opportunities as it already evolved from a checkout button to a platform of end-to-end solutions for both merchants and consumers. It’s no exaggeration to say that the digital wallet universe is a story of the clash of the titans, with PayPal going against Apple and against Google. Apple, Google and PayPal are competing for consumers’ wallets and the battle is as intense as it gets. Apply Pay is going from strength to strength, and it is also bringing the entire Apple ecosystem for the ride, seriously challenging PayPal whose days of dominating mobile payments are long gone. But PayPal is not giving its lunch to Apple nor anyone else by showing determination not to become obsolete. After all, it made a name for itself, and with a great name, it expanded into a supersized company, that on one hand is harder to steer, but on the other, it offers the broadest assortment of services to offer solutions that can supercharge a merchant's business. With its latest quarterly report, PayPal made it clear it will do whatever it takes to reignite growth of its branded offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "*\n\nGameStop rallies, sparks gains in other meme stocks\n\n*\n\nAlphabet OpenAI to launch search competitor\n\n*\n\nIndexes: S&P 500 off 0.04%, Nasdaq adds 0.27%, Dow off 0.15%\n\n(Updates with final prices, volume data)\n\nBy Sinéad Carew and Sruthi Shankar\n\nMay 13 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed very slightly lower on Monday as investors took a breather after three weekly gains while they awaited key inflation readings and earnings reports due this week while a survey showed consumers concerned about inflation.\n\nA Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey, released on Monday, found that Americans see inflation at 3.3% a year from now from March’s 3% while they expect inflation three years from now at 2.8%. This followed a University of Michigan report on Friday that showed U.S. consumer sentiment sagged to a six-month low in May as households worried about the cost of living.\n\nLast week the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both registered their third straight weeks of gains, boosted by strong earnings reports and signs of a cooling labor market that fueled bets of one or two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.\n\nBut on Monday investors appeared anxious to stay clear of making big bets ahead of April Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due out on Wednesday. They will also preparing to monitor producer price index data, retail sales data, weekly jobless claims and earnings reports from big retailers Home Depot and Walmart, all due out this week.\n\n\"Investors are like somebody looking out the window trying to see what the weather's like before deciding what to wear. Today and tomorrow are going to be all about Wednesday's consumer inflation report,\" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group in Dallas.\n\n\"In the last three months that's been the single biggest mover. Each of these times inflation's come in a little bit stickier than investors had expected. Each time that's happened investors have ratcheted back expectations for interest rate cuts.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 81.33 points, or 0.21%, to 39,431.51, the S&P 500 lost 1.26 points, or 0.02%, to 5,221.42 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 47.37 points, or 0.29%, to 16,388.24.\n\nAnthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, said the \"marked deterioration in consumer sentiment and rising expectations around inflation\" from the consumer sentiment surveys puts even more weight on the upcoming inflation data.\n\n\"Stocks are just kind of stuck in this really tight trading range until we get some more information on inflation trends,\" said Saglimbene.\n\nStory continues\n\nCore consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.3% on a month-over-month basis in April and 3.6% on an annual basis according to economist forecasts in a Reuters poll ahead of Wednesday's release.\n\nFed Vice Chair Phillip Jefferson said earlier on Monday that he supports keeping interest rates steady until it is clear that price pressures are moderating.\n\nAmong the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors only two gained ground on Monday.\n\nTechnology provided the biggest boost and\n\nApple was its biggest index point contributor.\n\nInvestors in the sector were focused on artificial intelligence technology with Apple shares closing up 1.8% after a report that it had closed in on an agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to use the startup's technology on the iPhone.\n\nOpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, said it would release a new AI model capable of realistic voice conversation and able to interact across text and image.\n\nAlphabet, expected to show off its own new AI-related features at its developers' conference on Tuesday, managed to close up 0.3% after falling as much as 2.7% during the session.\n\nShares of videogame retailer GameStop jumped soared 74% after \"Roaring Kitty\", a former marketer at an insurance firm credited with sparking the 2021 meme stock rally, returned to X.com after a three-year hiatus.\n\nOther highly shorted names involved in the 2021 meme rally also rose. AMC Entertainment jumped 78% and Koss Corp closed up 36.7%.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 10.09 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.79 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 311 new highs and 40 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.14-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 145 new highs and 91 new lows.

        "title": "Beyond the Road: Exploring the Impact of a Potential Rivian-Apple Collaboration",
        "content": "On May 6, reports hinted that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was exploring a potential partnership with a U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) company. With operations solely based in the U.S., Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) naturally rose to the top of the list as a potential candidate.\n\nThe details of the collaboration remain fuzzy and nothing more than rumors at this point, but if it ends up coming to fruition, it could result in significant benefits for each company. Here's why Apple needs Rivian, Rivian needs Apple, and what a future partnership might look like. Rivian EVs. Image source: Rivian.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nFor years, Apple has been flirting with the idea of building its own electric vehicle (EV). However, after investing $10 billion over the last decade and facing multiple failed attempts, it decided to scrap its plans in early 2024.\n\nYet with cars evolving into sophisticated computers on wheels, Apple sees an opportunity to diversify its ecosystem and tap into new revenue streams. By partnering with an upstart with a recognizable brand like Rivian, it could leverage expertise in EV technology and accelerate its entry into the automotive space.\n\nFor Rivian, a partnership with Apple couldn't come at a better time. The company finds itself in a precarious financial situation, bleeding cash as it strives to establish itself in the highly competitive EV market.\n\nWhile it's not unusual for EV start-ups to face profitability challenges in their early stages, Rivian's path to profitability appears daunting. Expenses continue to escalate, and its cash position has dwindled by 60% over the past three years. As of the first quarter, the company was losing over $38,000 per car.\n\nWith Apple, Rivian could get a boost in a variety of ways. Brand recognition would be an obvious one (Apple is one of the most widely recognized companies in the world), along with expertise in developing some of the most sophisticated and popular devices on the market. Putting that technology to work in a vehicle could open up unprecedented new opportunities.\n\nPotential partnership dynamics\n\nThere are obvious benefits if these two companies join forces. But what would it actually look like? A collaboration between Rivian and Apple could take various forms.\n\nThe most apparent possibility is a joint research and development effort in advancing autonomous driving technology. Rivian has made notable progress in this area with its Driver+ software, but it still requires a driver's attention.\n\nThis is where Apple could come in. With its deep pockets and technological prowess, the company could lead the way to groundbreaking innovations in self-driving and accelerate progress toward the coveted Level 4 or Level 5 autonomy, at which point drivers are no longer needed\n\nStory continues\n\nThe compatibility of the two companies is clear simply from the perspective that Rivian has the hardware: the infrastructure and supply chain already in place to mass-produce vehicles. Lacking the hardware, Apple would be the developer of the software.\n\nThis sort of arrangement has proved successful across several products. For example, Samsung's smartphones are integrated with the Android operating system of Alphabet.\n\nFor fun, let's speculate about the results if this partnership comes to fruition. An EV equipped with cutting-edge technology developed jointly by Rivian and Apple would have advanced autonomous driving capabilities, powered by Rivian's proprietary software stack that gets a boost from Apple's expertise in machine learning algorithms.\n\nWhat's more, drivers would enjoy a state-of-the-art infotainment system integrated into Apple's ecosystem, offering unparalleled connectivity and convenience.\n\nThings to keep in mind\n\nRumors of a partnership between Rivian and Apple are intriguing, and Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe didn't shy away from discussing its potential in the latest earnings call. But it's essential to remember that these are still just rumors. Such speculation alone doesn't necessarily warrant an investment in either company.\n\nInvestors should continue to evaluate Rivian and Apple as separate entities, considering their individual strengths, weaknesses, and market dynamics. However, keeping a close eye on developments related to this potential partnership is crucial, particularly for Rivian. A collaboration with Apple could represent the outlet Rivian needs to navigate its financial challenges and secure its position in the rapidly evolving EV market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Monopoly Definition and 12 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will go over the definition of a monopoly and take a look at the 12 near-monopoly stocks in the US. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US.\n\nA monopoly is characterized by a single seller holding sway over a market, offering a singular product. In its truest sense, a monopoly commands a 100% market share. Many sectors are governed by key players with substantial market dominance. These companies benefit from economies of scale and erect barriers to entry, thwarting potential newcomers from challenging their dominance. In our previous examination of near-monopoly stocks, we referenced Warren Buffett's 2011 testimony before the US Congress, in which he highlighted pricing power as a crucial factor in assessing a business. Buffett, one of the most renowned investors globally, has amassed billions through his publicly traded holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). With an impressive investment history and personal wealth, Buffett has sought out consumer monopolies whose products possess unique qualities such as patents, brand names, or other intangibles that effectively deter competition.\n\nIt's worth noting that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) holds the largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, valued at over $174.34 billion as of Q4 2023. The tech giant's dominance extends to several industries, either through outright monopoly or near-monopoly positions. Additionally, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks as the third-largest investment in Warren Buffett's portfolio. Headquartered in New York, the company offers credit and debit card services, alongside Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA).\n\nOverall, the financial media has been abuzz with discussions about the significant portion of the stock market surge in 2023 attributed to only seven companies, nicknamed the \"Magnificent 7.\" These select companies represent over 30% of the total value of the S&P 500, despite making up just 1.6% of the index, and contributed over 60% to the overall market gain in 2023. Excluding them, the stock market's increase last year would have been a modest 9% after adjusting for inflation. When examining profits, it's evident why. According to Deutsche Bank macro strategist Jim Reid, the Magnificent 7 generates approximately $361 billion annually. This amount is comparable to the combined profits of all companies in Japan and notably surpasses the total profits of all listed companies in the UK, which roughly amount to $217 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn theory, a monopoly might not seem problematic, but by definition, it could harm consumers if not closely regulated. Without competition, monopolies may charge excessive prices, offer subpar products, and limit choices to maximize their profits. While not outright banned by law, various regulations exist to ensure monopolies engage in fair practices. The Sherman Antitrust Act, for example, is a key legislation used to break up companies that stifle competition and prevent mergers that could create virtual monopolies. Another example comes in the form of lawsuits, whereby which governments aim to prevent anticompetitive practices in a market. The most recent one involved the US Department of Justice and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Earlier in March, the Justice Department, alongside over a dozen state attorneys general, lodged a lawsuit in the US District Court in New Jersey targeting the tech behemoth. Alleging anticompetitive behavior in the smartphone market, this move signifies another step in the Biden Administration's campaign to rein in the influence of Big Tech, and follows previous antitrust actions directed at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHowever, despite these regulations potentially limiting profits, investors often find monopolistic stocks attractive. The significant market share held by monopolies can contribute to long-term growth and value, offsetting some of the inherent risks associated with investing in any security. Market leaders like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) that have solidified their position by dominating a sector and securing a significant market share are often considered among the best near monopoly stocks in their respective industries. Monopoly Definition and 12 Near Monopoly Stocks in the US\n\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we've pinpointed 12 US stocks that demonstrate near-monopoly characteristics, largely driven by their significant market share. Many of these companies belong to the FAANG cohort, comprising major players in the technology sphere. These tech giants dominate various sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, mobile applications, operating systems, search engines, social media, and web browsers. Additionally, other stocks in our selection command near-monopoly positions in diverse sectors like alcoholic beverages, personal credit rating, and satellite radio.

(NYSE:MO) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our second example of a high-yielding security is the stock of Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO). Before we get into the details of why we started a position in Altria, a brief history is in order. The company was formerly known as Philip Morris before rebranding to Altria in 2003. Cynically, the rebranding was to minimize the negative attention from its tobacco business. However, the company also owned Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing, so it was logical to reflect its status as a conglomerate. Since rebranding, Altria has slowly “de-conglomerated”. It spun out Kraft in 2007. It spun out Philip Morris International in 2008. In 2021, it sold its Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business. Finally, last month Altria announced it is selling part of its 10% ownership in Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD)\n\nAndvari has followed Altria since we began our investment career. Profitability is extraordinary and the business requires minimal capital expenditures. Despite the volume of cigarettes having steadily declined—a great thing for our population health—Altria has still managed to grow revenues and profits with regular price increases…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n8.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple is gearing up to sell its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset outside the United States, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, in a bid to invigorate demand for its most expensive bet in years.\n\nThe iPhone-maker has flown hundreds of employees from its international stores to Cupertino, California and started training them on how to demonstrate the $3,499 headset to customers, the report added, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nApple plans to bring its Vision Pro to international markets after its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), scheduled to be held from June 10 to June 14, the report said.\n\nThe training of workers, which takes as many as four days, from Germany, France, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China, suggests these will be some of the first international markets for the device.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe Vision Pro headset was unveiled in June last year and hit the shelves in the U.S. from Feb. 2. The headset's launch in the international markets could help Apple attract customers at a time when sales of its most popular product iPhone are slowing.\n\nAfter initial enthusiasm for the Vision Pro, which has a hefty price tag, the demand has been slowing, according to analysts.\n\nIn March, Apple CEO Tim Cook was quoted in China's state-run CCTV Finance saying that Apple's Vision Pro will hit the mainland China market this year and that the company will continue to ramp up research and development investment in China.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Was Key to Success in My Stock-Picking Derby",
        "content": "You had to pick Nvidia.\n\nTo do well in my latest annual stock-picking contest, Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, it helped immensely if Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of your selections. Six people chose it as one of their three picks, and each of them finished among the top 10 contestants.\n\nHarriet Ruben, a retired real estate broker from Fairlawn, Ohio, won the latest contest with an 88.7% return. She scored a 144% gain in Nvidia, 96% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and 26% in Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). All figures are total returns including dividends.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nThese are popular, large-capitalization growth stocks, which are the type of stocks that Ruben favors in her actual investing. She says she has a large portfolio, which includes each of her three contest entries, plus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and quite a few other stocks.\n\nRuben says she listens to corporate chief executives who are interviewed on television, then follows up with statistical research on her broker's web site. I look for the next best thing,' she says.\n\nBeaten down\n\nUsing quite a different approach, Ted Dempsey of Virginia Beach, Virginia, grabbed second place in the Derby. He is 87 years old, a retired Navy officer and consultant. No longer an active investor, he liked to speculate on stocks that are beaten down in price.\n\nFor his contest entries last May, he chose Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) and PacWest Bancorp, which was acquired by Banc of California Inc. (NYSE:BANC). His average return on the three was 76%.\n\nDempsey says he was able to retire mostly because of a big gain on his investment in Labor Ready Inc., now known as TrueBlue Inc. (NYSE:TBI), an industrial staffing company. I happened to know the two founders of Labor Ready, he says. I was probably excessive in buying it but I got very lucky.\n\nBitcoin surge\n\nRobert B.K. Krout of Virginia Beach finished third with a 75.8% return. His return came on the strength of a 298% surge in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:EBTC); his other two picks declined.\n\nKrout is a retired mechanical engineer and a volunteer with the Sierra Club Offshore Wind Group. He believes bitcoin prices tend to follow a pattern: a low period for a year or so before demand and price rise again.\n\nIronically, crypto currencies play only a small role in Krout's real-life investing. He owns some bitcoin and some ethereum, but regards them as speculative and limits his crypto exposure to about 2% of his total portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nHis other two contest picks for 2023-24 were Albemarle corp. (NYSE:ALB) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). He continues to like them, and also likes a number of big technology names.\n\nWide spread\n\nThis year there was a huge dispersion of contestants' results. Of the 34 people who entered, nine had returns of 50% or better, while 11 had losses. The worst loss was 39%.\n\nThe median return for contestants was 20%. That was close to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index, which was 20.2%.\n\nYou can play\n\nYou are welcome to enter the next edition of Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, which will be the 17th such contest I have hosted. To enter, please email or mail me the following items:\n\nYour name Your Address Your Occupation Your Email address You home and work phone numbers. The names and stock symbols of the three stocks you choose. You don't have to give your reasoning, but I appreciate it if you do.\n\nEmail me your entry at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com. Or mail it to John Dorfman, Dorfman Value Investments, 101 Federal Street, Suite 1900, Boston MA 02110.\n\nEntries must be postmarked or time stamped by midnight May 31, 2024. The contest period will be from the market close on that date through the close on April 30, 2025.\n\nIf you finish in the top three, I will want to interview you on short notice and possibly on a weekend, so the phone numbers are vital.\n\nYou do not need to own the stocks you select, but it is fine if you do. Stocks must be traded in the U.S., but need not necessarily be U.S. companies. Short sales are permitted but not encouraged, since I have a separate short-selling contest. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are permitted.\n\nThere is no fee to enter. The winner will receive a $100 gift certificate to the restaurant of her or his choice.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts, and a syndicated columnist.

        "content": "iPhone Exports From India Double, Predicted To Hit Record $13B This Year As Apple's Pivot Away From China Pays Off\n\nThis story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has reported a remarkable surge in its iPhone exports from India, with the figures for April nearly doubling to $1.1 billion, up from $580 million in the previous year.\n\nAs reported by The Economic Times, this robust start has stimulated predictions that Apple's exports could surpass the $13 billion mark, solidifying India's place as its second-largest iPhone manufacturing hub after China. Presently, approximately 14%-15% of Apple’s total iPhone production occurs in India, with projections to reach 26% by 2026.\n\nIn FY2024, Apple's total production in India reached $14 billion, with exports making up over $10 billion. This represents the highest annual export value by any company in India.\n\nSee Also: Airtel, Google Cloud Join Forces To Accelerate Cloud Adoption And AI In India\n\nApple operates through its contract manufacturers Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron, all of which benefit from India's production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. Foxconn is leading the way in exports, managing more than 70% of the shipments. Wistron, now owned by Tata Group, and Pegatron, currently in discussions for a majority stake sale to Tata, also contribute significantly.\n\nApril's surge indicates that Apple might surpass the fourth-year targets of the PLI scheme. While Apple and a few other companies, such as Samsung and Dixon Technologies, consistently meet PLI targets, many beneficiaries grapple with achieving their set goals. Meanwhile, Apple’s market presence in India is steadily increasing, with a 38% YoY growth and aspirations to elevate its local market share into double digits from around 7% in FY24.\n\nIf you’d like to stay ahead of the curve on the Indian market, sign up for our Ring The Bell newsletter by clicking here.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article iPhone Exports From India Double, Predicted To Hit Record $13B This Year As Apple's Pivot Away From China Pays Off originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Software Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "U.S. equities, especially undervalued software stocks, appear to be in rally mode. As of the end of Wednesday’s trading session, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen 2.37 percentage points in the last month. Meanwhile, its counterpart the S&P500 has appreciated 3.18 percent. This comes after both indices suffered significant losses during the month of April, forcing equities investors and traders to question whether or not U.S. equities would be able to sustain a rally throughout 2024. The macroeconomic environment remains to be a key pain point for the market, and market participants should expect more volatility in the coming weeks.\n\nNevertheless, rising stock prices implies higher valuations. To help investors look for cheaper investments, below is a list of three of the most undervalued software stocks in the space these days.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re giving or receiving payments, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is already an established name for you. Founded in 1998, the payments platform boasts more than 400 million active accounts and offers a variety of payment services tailored for different kinds of merchants.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn early February, PayPal announced its fourth quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2023. The payments platform beat analyst estimates on revenue, earnings per share, and total payments volume. Revenue came in at $8 billion for the quarter and $29.8 billion for the full year. Both of which represent year-over-year growth in the high single digits. GAAP EPS figures for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year were $1.29 per share and $3.84 per share, respectively. PayPal was able to deliver strong earnings growth off the back of various organization costs cuts. Moreover, with PayPal’s Q1 2024 earnings print the company boosted its profit outlook for the year.\n\nThe payments platform trades at 15.5x forward earnings, and PayPal’s plans to revive its branded checkout business could create secular tailwinds for the business while also providing investors with multiple expansion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of internet giant Google, will be the only tech giant to make this list. The tech firm’s dominance in search is very well-known at this point. However, growth prospects in areas of both cloud computing and artificial intelligence coupled with its relatively low trading multiple make Alphabet one of the undervalued software stocks currently for sale.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite worries about Google Cloud and is competitive strengths with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Google’s cloud platform continues to be a robust engine of growth for the software giant. For Alphabet’s fourth quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2023, Google Cloud revenue increased 26% year-over-year. Additionally, in the company’s first quarter earnings print for fiscal year 2024, Google Cloud increased revenues by 18% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income for Google Cloud quadrupled from $191 million in Q1 2023 to $900 million in Q1 2024.\n\nThe announcement of the software firm’s first dividend also elated investors. As the company continues to grow in cloud and AI, while also keeping costs down, investors should find themselves quite pleased. Alphabet trades at 21.9x forward earnings, which is less than competitors like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nTrimble (TRMB) The Trimble (TRMB) headquarters in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) is a software platform working to bring digital transformation to the construction and infrastructure industries. The company’s software helps to with everything from project design and visualization to digital monitoring of equipment and real assets. The infrastructure and construction spaces are some of the most underserved sectors into terms of technology penetration, which makes the opportunity to help digitize these industries immense. Furthermore, the $1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill passed some years ago still has funded ready to be allocated, and this will help to provide secular growth tailwinds for Trimble for years to come.\n\nIn their recent quarterly earnings report for fiscal year 2024, Trimble was able to beat Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $953.3 million, while annualized recurring revenue ballooned to $2 billion, up 23% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nTrimble trades at 19.7x forward earnings, which is not very cheap, but given the opportunity in the space in which Trimble operates, the company’s growth prospects are solid.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Big Tech sees neurotechnology as its next AI frontier",
        "content": "Neurotechnology using artificial intelligence is opening up new possibilities in healthcare that previously didn’t exist.\n\nFor decades companies and researchers have been exploring implantable devices that interpret signals in the brain and translate them into words or physical commands. The technology is not new, but now, artificial intelligence is accelerating advances, allowing people affected by debilitating diseases to communicate in ways that were physically impossible before.\n\nThese devices have been game changers for people like Rodney, a patient living with ALS who had a Stentrode device implanted in his brain. The device, which was developed by Synchron, a neurotech company backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Microsoft’s Bill Gates, contains a tiny electrode that converts brain signals into physical actions, allowing Rodney to type on a keyboard using only his thoughts.\n\nWhile neurotechnology can be empowering for patients like Rodney, AI could make less invasive neurotech more accessible for everyday consumers and spur the next generation of consumer-facing tech products.\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, the market for neurotech devices was valued at around $15 billion in 2023, and it's projected to reach over $55 billion by 2032. That's a major reason why Big Tech companies like Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) are backing research into devices that can decode thoughts and perceptions without requiring invasive surgery.\n\nBut as Big Tech moves ahead to build off neurotech advancements in the medical world, experts have cautioned that it could put our most valuable data — the privacy of our thoughts — at risk.\n\n“This is our final fortress of privacy, and we've given up every other aspect of privacy that exists,” said Nita Farahany, a futurist, tech ethicist, and author of “The Battle for Your Brain.”\n\nBig Tech wants to read your mind\n\nElon Musk’s Neuralink made headlines early this year when the company implanted its first human patient with a brain-computer interface (BCI), though the company said on Thursday it encountered some issues with the implant.\n\nThe Neuralink implant, which has over 1,000 electrodes and 64 threads, experienced a malfunction after a number of threads retracted from the brain, which decreased the number of effective electrodes. In a blog post, the company said this would not negatively impact how the implant works.\n\nMusk is not the only CEO trying to make neurotechnology a reality. At least 30 companies are currently selling neurotechnology or developing the technology. Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla and Neuralink, speaks at the Milken Institute's Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on May 6, 2024, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Apu Gomes/Getty Images) (Apu Gomes via Getty Images)\n\nApple, for instance, has a patent for AirPods with EEG technology embedded to measure brain activity. Given concerns over Apple’s sluggish iPhone sales, some investors are hoping the company will turn out exciting new products that will drive additional revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nHealthcare has long been a goal for Apple. CEO Tim Cook laid out this strategy in 2019, saying, “If you zoom out into the future ... and you ask the question, what was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind, it will be about health.”\n\nMeta is another company funding a team of neuroscientists who are pushing this research further to understand how humans process language.\n\nIn one study conducted by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group, researchers flashed an image in front of participants for 1.5 seconds. Users seated in a neuroimaging machine thought of the image they saw, and AI was able to use that brain activity data to recreate the image.\n\n\"At the moment, this is not a mind-reading technology,\" Jean-Rémi King, the lead neuroscientist working on the project, told Yahoo Finance. \"What we can try to do is reconstruct the image that they see at the given moment, so we really decode perception.\"\n\nThe results weren’t perfect, as seen in the image below, but they were close enough that the research team initially thought the test was flawed. On the left is the photo Meta's Fundamental AI Research team showed participants. The image on the right shows the image that AI reconstructed by decoding participants' brain activity.\n\n“The first reaction was … let's try to find where we could have had some bugs that could explain the quality of these results,” King said.\n\nKing stressed that consumer-facing products are not the end goal of his research, and Meta says its aim is to “help people who have suffered traumatic brain injury to communicate.”\n\nBut at the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made the company's neurotechnology ambitions clear since 2021, when he began touting an armband that uses electromyography to detect neural signals, allowing users to type and click on a screen with the subtlest of hand movements.\n\n\"I think we’ll start getting some consumer neural interfaces soon,\" Zuckerberg said in April. \"I’m not talking about something that jacks into your brain. I’m talking about something that you wear on your wrist.\"\n\nThe privacy problem\n\nThere's a big question underlying all this research and product development: What does our world look like if Big Tech companies can literally read your mind?\n\nNoninvasive brain-monitoring devices can be revolutionary in medicine for patients, but not everyone is thrilled by the prospect of Big Tech having access to peoples' thoughts.\n\nNeurorights advocates believe our thoughts are the last piece of data we have left to ourselves. That’s why they are now fighting for legislation that would safeguard mental privacy while tech companies continue funding brain-scanning research.\n\n\"There's absolutely no regulation,\" said Dr. Rafael Yuste, a professor of biological sciences and neuroscience at Columbia University. \"It's like the Wild West.\" On July 6, 2024, electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the electrical activity of the brain, will celebrate its 100th anniversary. (Jacob Schröter/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nAfter years of research, Yuste discovered a way to control the thoughts of mice using lasers. The experiment scared him so much that he co-founded the Neurorights Foundation in an effort to safeguard thought privacy.\n\nAnd already, concerns about the privacy implications of neurotechnology are driving policy change. In April, Colorado passed a bill that expanded the state’s privacy act to include neural rights — the first of its kind in the US. Similar legislation is also on the table in states such as California and Minnesota.\n\n“The one space we have for mental reprieve is really our brains and mental states,\" Farahany said. \"It's the kind of final piece of the puzzle.”\n\nFarahany has a proposed framework for neurorights legislation that argues for more privacy overall, with “a right to self-determination over our brain and mental experiences.”\n\nAccording to Farahany, it would still allow patients who want — and even need — neurotech to have access to it.\n\nFor Rodney's part, when I asked him via WhatsApp what he hopes his Stentrode device will accomplish long term, he thought back: “Hopefully, it will get to more people.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Ultra-Popular Stocks Billionaire Investors Are Selling",
        "content": "Investors are never lacking for data on Wall Street. We're currently in the heart of earnings season, and economic data continues to be reported on a near-daily basis. But arguably the most important data release of the quarter is set to occur this Wednesday, May 15. This marks the deadline for institutional money managers to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds, with at least $100 million in assets under management, have been buying, selling, and holding in the most recent quarter -- in this instance, the March-ended quarter. It's not uncommon for professional and everyday investors to follow in the footsteps of Wall Street's most-successful asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut you don't have to wait until this coming Wednesday to get a sneak peak at what some of Wall Street's most-prominent asset managers have been up to. Thanks to interviews, annual meetings, and earnings releases, select billionaire investors have revealed selling activity in three ultra-popular stocks during the first quarter.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller sells shares of Nvidia\n\nThe first widely owned stock that was given at least a partial heave-ho during the March-ended quarter is semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In a recent interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, Druckenmiller admitted that his fund, Duquesne Family Office, cut its position in Nvidia in \"late March.\" For context, Duquesne Family Office held 617,494 shares of Nvidia, along with 489,500 Nvidia call options, as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nAlthough Druckenmiller believes the value of artificial intelligence (AI) for corporate America may be undervalued looking five years into the future, he admits that near-term hype may have gotten ahead of itself for AI stocks, including Nvidia.\n\nFor the moment, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed top choice by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. In particular, the H100 is powering generative AI solutions and helping to train large language models.\n\nHowever, the coming 12 months could prove especially challenging for the backbone of the AI revolution.\n\nFor starters, competition is coming at Nvidia from all angles. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have AI-accelerators designed to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia's H100 in enterprise data centers.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's top four customers (roughly 40% of net sales), which are members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are all developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are complementary to Nvidia's H100 GPUs, it seems highly likely that the Magnificent Seven will be far less reliant on Nvidia's AI infrastructure beyond 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, AI-GPU scarcity was the driving force behind Nvidia's 217% sales growth from its Data Center segment. But as AMD, Intel, and other Magnificent Seven companies deploy their own chips, Nvidia could struggle to maintain its otherworldly pricing power on its GPUs.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that every next-big-thing investment trend for three decades has endured a bubble in its early innings of expansion. It's incredibly likely that investors will, once again, overestimate the adoption of a new technology. If history repeats itself and the AI bubble bursts, no company will be hit harder than Nvidia. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWarren Buffett dumps Paramount Global\n\nAnother billionaire investor that let the cat out of the bag before releasing a required 13F is Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. During his company's annual shareholder meeting on May 4, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" confessed that all shares of media behemoth Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA) -- 63,322,491 shares, as of Dec. 31, 2023 -- were sold at a loss during the first quarter.\n\nBuffett typically approaches his investments outside of the financial sector with a focus on consumer habits. His thesis was likely that a rebound in advertising for Paramount's TV network segment, coupled with a lengthy history of consumers gobbling up traditional and streamed content, would allow Paramount to regain its luster. Unfortunately, this failed to come to fruition.\n\nLike most legacy media companies, Paramount has struggled to make its direct-to-consumer segment profitable. The costs associated with building its content library and marketing its streaming network have weighed on its bottom line.\n\nBut if there's a silver lining here, it's that global DTC subscriber count and average revenue per user are climbing, which suggests that Paramount has been successful in raising subscription prices without scaring away its members. The company noted that year-over-year operating losses before depreciation and amortization have shrunk in each of the last four quarters for its DTC segment.\n\nThe advertising environment has been challenging, as well. Last year, a couple of predictive indicators, such as the first sizable decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression, signaled a high probability of the U.S. falling into a recession. Advertisers often front-run economic weakness by reducing their spending. Weaker ad revenue has undeniably hurt Paramount's legacy TV network.\n\nThere's also been concern about Paramount's ability to service its $14.6 billion in long-term debt ($12.2 billion in net debt). Unless the company can substantially lessen its streaming losses, it's going to be difficult to silence critics.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" also pared back Berkshire's stake in Apple\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's selling didn't end with Paramount Global. Although we have to wait a few more days to get the complete story, Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter operating results show that a sizable chunk -- about 115 million shares -- of the company's stake in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was given the heave-ho.\n\nIn addition to Berkshire's operating results spilling the beans, Buffett freely admitted during his company's annual shareholder meeting that he and his investment team pared down this mammoth stake in the March-ended quarter. He justified this reduction by pointing to corporate tax rates. Buffett opined that investors would come to appreciate Berkshire locking in gains at a 21% peak corporate tax rate given the likelihood that corporate tax rates rise in the future.\n\nDespite jettisoning around 13% of his company's stake in Apple, Warren Buffett still views the company as Berkshire's best business.\n\nApple has an exceptionally loyal base of customers, and it's frequently led with innovation. CEO Tim Cook has successfully overseen the development of domestic market share-leading iPhones, as well as Apple's transformation to a platform's company.\n\nBut if you asked Warren Buffett what his favorite thing is about Apple, it might very well be the company's unsurpassed capital-return program. Apple is on track to dole out a little over $15.4 billion in dividends to its shareholders this year, and has repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Buffett loves buybacks because they can incrementally increase the ownership stakes of long-term investors.\n\nHowever, Apple isn't immune to headwinds. Following a modest sales decline in fiscal 2023 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September), the second-largest public company by market cap has seen its net sales slip by less than 1% through the first half of the current fiscal year. While subscription services revenue has been strong, physical product sales remain weak.\n\nFurthermore, while modest cost-cutting and an aggressive share repurchase program have kept earnings per share (EPS) moving in the right direction, a deeper dive into Apple's net income shows the company's growth engine has stalled.\n\nApple was a bargain when it was delivering sustained double-digit sales growth and trading at a multiple of 10 to 15 times forward-year EPS. But at 27 times forward-year EPS and with sales going nowhere, this Wall Street darling looks to be losing its sheen.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's $189 Billion Subtle Warning to Wall Street Shouldn't Be Ignored",
        "content": "Some 51 years ago, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett held his company's first annual shareholder meeting in the cafeteria of a subsidiary and drew a few dozen people. A little over week ago, Berkshire lured in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors to Omaha, Nebraska, for its latest annual gathering.\n\nPeople flock to this annual meeting to listen to the \"Oracle of Omaha\" speak about his investing philosophy, the U.S. economy, and select stocks held by Berkshire.\n\nWhile these annual meetings consistently offer a cheery tone and speak to Warren Buffett's and the late Charlie Munger's long-term investing ethos, Berkshire Hathaway's 2024 meeting was overshadowed by a very large number that offers a subtle warning Wall Street would be foolish (with a small \"f\") to ignore. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWarren Buffett continues to be a net-seller of stocks\n\nAlthough we won't get a precise look at Berkshire Hathaway's more than $360 billion investment portfolio until the company files its Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission this Wednesday, May 15, the company's operating results speak volumes about what Buffett and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been up to.\n\nDuring the March-ended quarter, the Oracle of Omaha and his team sold close to $20 billion in equity securities while purchasing less than $2.7 billion. This marked the sixth consecutive quarter that Berkshire Hathaway was a net-seller of stocks. All told, net-selling activity has reached $56 billion since Oct. 1, 2022.\n\nA significant percentage of the close to $20 billion in equity security sales during the first quarter relates to the disposal of around 115 million shares of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is still far-and-away the largest holding in Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nDuring his annual Q&A with investors, Warren Buffett suggested that tax reasons were behind the hefty reduction in its Apple stake. The Oracle noted that while the peak marginal corporate income tax rate is currently 21%, fiscal policy changes are liable to increase this figure in the future. Locking in gains at a lower tax rate is something that he believes Berkshire's shareholders will come to appreciate.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's cash pile is swelling, and that's historically worrisome\n\nHowever, the bigger story is that Berkshire's cash pile, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills, surged to $189 billion, as of the end of March, from $167.6 billion to close out 2023. In fact, Warren Buffett opined during the annual shareholder meeting that his company's war chest could hit the psychological $200 billion mark when the current quarter ends.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving a lot of capital on hand is normally viewed as a positive by Wall Street and investors. But that's not the case for an investing great like Warren Buffett, who for nearly six decades has run circles around Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index by putting his company's cash to work via investments and acquisitions -- Berkshire owns approximately five dozen businesses, including railroad BNSF and insurer GEICO.\n\nDuring Berkshire's annual meetings, as well as in Buffett's annual letter to shareholders, the Oracle almost always strikes a positive tone on the U.S. economy and long-term investing. However, Berkshire's ongoing cash build makes it plainly evident that Buffett and his team aren't seeing much in the way of value.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's greatest investment minds are focused on buying stakes in wonderful companies at a \"fair\" price. At the moment, the S&P 500 is exceptionally pricey. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nWhen the closing bell rang on May 7, the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio) clocked in at 33.95. The Shiller P/E ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years, which means it smooths out the impact of one-off events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, over time.\n\nNot only is the current reading nearly double the average multiple for this valuation tool when back-tested to 1871, but it marks the third-highest readout during a bull market. in plainer terms, stocks are really pricey right now.\n\nThe five previous instances where the Shiller P/E ratio surpassed 30 during a bull market eventually resulted in the S&P 500 and/or Dow Jones Industrial Average losing between 20% and 89% of their value. We may not know ahead of time when these downturns will take shape, but a Shiller P/E ratio surpassing 30 has historically been a clear warning sign that a correction awaits Wall Street.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, we also witnessed Berkshire's cash hoard substantially grow just prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the housing crisis in 2007, and the bear market of 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis isn't Warren Buffett's first rodeo -- trust the process\n\nIn addition to Warren Buffett subtly warning with his company's growing cash pile that the stock market may be trading at an irrational valuation, we've witnessed the first notable drop in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression. All signs would appear to point to downside in the U.S. economy and/or stock market in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWhile this may not be what you want to hear as an investor, keep in mind that this isn't Warren Buffett's first rodeo. He's successfully steered Berkshire Hathaway through a number of recessions, geopolitical concerns, and stock market corrections/bear markets during his nearly six decades at the helm. His company has emerged stronger following each and every one of these events.\n\nIt can be argued that Warren Buffett's greatest strength is putting his company's capital to work during periods of historic fear and uncertainty.\n\nFor instance, Buffett's company was instrumental in helping Bank of America rebuild confidence in its stock. Berkshire acquired $5 billion in BofA's preferred stock to shore up its capital reserves during the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis. This position, which also came with warrants to purchase up to 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock at $7.14, has made Berkshire a handsome profit.\n\nBuffett, Combs, and Weschler also fully understand the difference between short-term instability and long-term expansion. Only three out of 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II reached the 12-month mark, and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months in duration. Comparatively, most periods of economic expansion have stuck around for multiple years, with two periods of growth topping 10 years.\n\nIt's official. A new bull market is confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 is now up 20% from its 10/12/22 closing low. The prior bear market saw the index fall 25.4% over 282 days.\r\n\r\nRead more at https://t.co/H4p1RcpfIn. pic.twitter.com/tnRz1wdonp\n\n-- Bespoke (@bespokeinvest) June 8, 2023\n\nThis same disparity between optimism and skepticism can be seen in the stock market.\n\nLast June, the researchers at Bespoke Investment Group released a data set that exhaustively calculated the length of every bear and bull market in the S&P 500 since the Great Depression began in September 1929. Whereas the average S&P 500 bear market has lasted just 286 calendar days (around 9.5 months), the typical S&P 500 bull market has endured 1,011 calendar days (roughly two years, nine months) over a 94-year stretch.\n\nEven though Buffett's short-term actions sometimes fail to line up with his long-term vision, he still firmly believes in America and the U.S. stock market -- and you should, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple Just Announced a $110 Billion Stock Buyback. Here's Why I Still Wouldn't Buy the Stock.",
        "content": "Earnings season is in full swing, and all eyes are on the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) just hit the earnings tape with one major headline: a $110 billion stock buyback authorization. This is a notable announcement, as it marks the largest share buyback in U.S. corporate history.\n\nLet's break down why stock buybacks are important, and analyze some of the other themes of Apple's earnings. After a thorough review of the report, you may want to think twice before scooping up shares of the iPhone maker.\n\nStock buybacks are great\n\nThe chart below illustrates Apple's stock buyback history over the last 10 years. Clearly, the company has done a stellar job returning capital to investors through a series of consistent stock buybacks: AAPL Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) Chart\n\nOne of the biggest reasons a company may purchase its own shares is because management views the stock as undervalued.\n\nA more subtle reason why a company may repurchase stock is to increase earnings per share (EPS). This is where one of my suspicions and concerns comes into play. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut where is Apple's real growth coming from?\n\nBelow is a summary of Apple's annual revenue growth over the last several quarters:\n\nQuarter ended Dec. 31, 2022: negative 5% Quarter ended April 1, 2023: negative 3% Quarter ended July 1, 2023: negative 1% Quarter ended Sept. 30, 2023: negative 1% Quarter ended Dec. 30, 2023: 2% Quarter ended March 30, 2024: negative 4%\n\nFor more than a year, Apple has consistently experienced a year-over-year revenue drop -- with the lone exception being the holiday season at the end of last year.\n\nWhile a challenging macroeconomic picture with lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs is playing some role in Apple's struggles, there are deeper issues at hand. Specifically, Apple's business in China -- one of its biggest markets -- is decelerating.\n\nFor the period ended March 30, Apple's revenue in China dropped 8% year over year to $16.4 billion. Much of this was attributable to a stalling iPhone segment, which dropped 10% year over year to $45.9 billion in all countries.\n\nConsidering that the iPhone is Apple's biggest source of revenue, and China is one of the company's core markets, the combination of decelerating growth in both areas doesn't exactly spell confidence for investors.\n\nAs sales continue to fall and as Apple remains silent about its ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI), it will become harder for the company to generate strong earnings power.\n\nLook at the valuation\n\nRight now, Apple trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28 -- considerably higher than the S&P 500's forward P/E of 20.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany of Apple's megacap peers have made notable strides in AI and are already seeing new waves of growth. Apple's silence on this issue is perplexing, and adds to my suspicion that the company is at a crossroads and can't seem to decide on a direction. Therefore, the stock's valuation premium isn't really warranted, in my opinion.\n\nThe company has over $160 billion of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. So the latest buyback plan looks like an excuse to deploy some capital to distract investors from a consistently declining revenue base and an unclear AI vision.\n\nWhile Apple could surprise the market with a turnaround, I'm not overly confident that'll come anytime soon. I'd stay clear of Apple right now. The stock looks pricey, and there are better opportunities for growth investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 easiest degrees that pay well. We have also talked about the latest statistics related to college degree holders in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Easiest Degrees That Pay Well.\n\nIn 2022, the Lumina Foundation released a report in which it highlighted that the percentage of working-age adults in the United States holding college degrees or similar postsecondary credentials had risen to 54.3%. This was a major increase from 2009 to 2021, where the percentage of adults aged 25 to 64 with college degrees, certificates, or industry-recognized certifications increased by over 16 percentage points. This increase also represents the highest attainment rate recorded since tracking began in 2008.\n\nHowever, despite these promising developments, major disparities do persist across racial and ethnic lines. While attainment levels have risen across all demographics, major gaps remain as Black, Hispanic, Latinx and Native American adults still lag behind the national average of 46.5%.\n\nMoreover, in 2021, nearly 38% of Americans aged 25 and older possessed a bachelor's degree, with an additional 10.5% holding an associate degree. Over the past decade, this percentage has increased by 7.5 points. Interestingly, women now surpass men in college graduation rates, as 39% of women aged 25 and older have attained at least a bachelor's degree compared to 37% of men in the same age group. This trend is more pronounced among younger adults, with 46% of women aged 25 to 34 holding bachelor's degrees compared to 36% of men.\n\nRacial and ethnic disparities do persist in college completion rates. In 2021, 61% of Asian Americans aged 25 and older held a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 42% of White adults, 28% of Black adults, and 21% of Hispanic adults. However, the share of bachelor's degree holders has increased across all racial and ethnic groups since 2010.\n\nWhile college graduates generally enjoy higher earnings and lower unemployment rates, recent graduates are more likely to be underemployed, with 41% of those aged 22 to 27 working in jobs that typically do not require a college degree. To read more about unemployment, see the European Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rates.\n\nNow that we have established that college graduates have higher salaries in general, let’s look at some of the easiest careers that pay the most. While there are no easy majors that pay 6 figures, there are high-paying low-stress jobs without a degree like air traffic controller which only require an associate degree. In the US, younger individuals also pursue short degrees that pay well like webdesigning. To read more about such careers, see the Easiest Jobs That Pay $100K.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore getting into our list of easiest degrees that pay well, let’s look at some of the multinationals that have been actively contributing to students and graduates around the world for a brighter future.\n\nSince its inception, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been committed to supporting education especially with its advocacy for tax-deductible technology donations to schools and its donation of thousands of Apple II computers through programs like Kids Can't Wait. Today, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues this legacy by offering educational discounts on a range of products like MacBooks, iPads, and more, with discounts typically around 10% off retail prices. This discount extends to teachers and students in K-12 and higher education institutions, as well as homeschool teachers and parents purchasing on behalf of students. These discounts make Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s technology more accessible to educational institutions and individuals.\n\nFurthermore, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) provides a wealth of resources through its Apple Education Community, which is a free online platform designed to support teachers in utilizing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products effectively for their teaching practices. The Community includes forums for educators to connect, share experiences, and seek advice, as well as a Learning Center offering tutorials and lesson ideas in multiple languages.\n\nOn the other hand, in response to a nationwide shortage of truck drivers, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) has initiated a program to offer its employees the opportunity to become commercial truck drivers. With an enticing starting salary of up to $110,000 for first-year drivers and a 12-week training program, the retail giant aimed to fill the gap within its workforce of 1.6 million employees.  The program's success was proved as the first batch of graduates observed substantial increases in their income.\n\nMoreover, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) also committed itself to diversity and inclusion by including women as a significant portion of the program's participants. With women comprising 8.1% of the trucking industry's professional drivers, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s initiative contributed to breaking gender barriers in a historically male-dominated field. 15 Easiest Degrees That Pay Well\n\nA modern student in a classroom with a laptop, symbolizing the modern education environment.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the easiest degrees that pay well, we identified degrees with two main characteristics that are often associated with “easy” degrees. Firstly, we looked for degrees with limited math or science requirements as they are perceived to be easier for students who largely struggle in the areas. Secondly, we looked for degrees that had low coursework complexity which usually are programs that rely heavily on memorization rather than critical analysis or problem-solving. We used Reddit as our primary source to gauge the opinions of Americans regarding these two factors related to college degrees and hence, identified 25 such degrees.\n\nOf those 25, the 15 with the highest average salaries of graduates in the respective fields were eventually selected and have been presented in ascending order of average salaries below. We obtained the data on average salaries for these degrees from Payscale.com.\n\nPlease note that the data points covering median salaries, job growth percentages, and numbers of job openings for each role have also been primarily obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the year 2023.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Education\n\nAverage Salary: $54,000\n\nThis is one of the unique degrees that pay well. It is worth highlighting that preschool teachers require no prior work experience or on-the-job training. With a projected job outlook of 3% from 2022 to 2032, an estimated 17,200 new positions are expected to open within this period. With over half a million jobs in 2022, the profession plays a key role in laying the educational groundwork for children's future success.\n\n14. Bachelor of Science in Social Work\n\nAverage Salary: $58,000\n\nSocial workers have a median salary of $58,380 per year. Unlike some professions, entry-level social workers often don't need prior work experience, but on-the-job training is common. With a projected job growth of 7% from 2022 to 2032, the field is expected to add 53,800 new jobs.\n\nTo become a social worker, one can also obtain an associate degree of two years in social work, making it one of the quickest degrees to get.\n\n13. Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)\n\nAverage Salary: $65,000\n\nThe Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) is a 4-5 year undergraduate degree with a focus on creative and visual arts. Typical majors include art education, dance, film, music education, and theater. The typical cost for pursuing this degree averages $10,740 annually for in-state students at public institutions. BFA graduates can pursue careers as graphic designers, video producers, photographers, or teachers, with entry-level salaries of around $65,000.\n\n12. Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies\n\nAverage Salary: $66,000\n\nIn 2021, the field of Philosophy and Religion boasted 495,600 employed individuals, with a median annual wage of $60,000. Despite its often abstract nature, philosophy and religion offer viable career paths across different occupations.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Maryland and Massachusetts are the highest-paying states for religious teachers in the US with average salaries of $120,650 and $117,520.\n\n11. Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice\n\nAverage Salary: $67,000\n\nIn the US, pursuing a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice requires completing around 120 credits over four years. Three primary degree options are available for majors like Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences. The coursework covers different aspects of the criminal justice system like criminology, forensic science, criminal law, and ethics. Admission typically requires a high school diploma or GED, official transcripts, minimum GPA, and standardized test scores.\n\n10. Bachelor of Science in Marketing\n\nAverage Salary: $67,990\n\nBachelor of Science in Marketing is one of the easiest degrees to get a job with due to its high demand and potential. While the average salary of marketing majors in the US is around $67,990, salaries for managerial roles in the field are exceptionally high. For example, advertising, promotions, and marketing managers earned a median salary of $156,580 annually in 2023. With 389,000 jobs in 2022, this field is expected to grow 6% from 2022 to 2032 which will result in 24,300 new positions.\n\n9. Bachelor of Arts in English\n\nAverage Salary: $68,000\n\nThe English language teaching market in the United States saw significant activity in 2022. With 750 active providers nationwide, California was the hub with 16% of the total, followed closely by Florida and New York. These institutions enrolled a combined total of 70,579 students.\n\nMoreover, With so many online options available to pursue a degree in English Language, it is one of the easy online degrees that pay well. To read about companies offering English teaching opportunities, see 13 Best Companies for Teaching English Online.\n\n8. Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology\n\nAverage Salary: $68,300\n\nWhile Anthropology is often considered one of the easiest college majors, there are only 6290 accredited anthropologists across the US. Moreover, a bachelor's in anthropology typically spans 120 credits, though some programs like Oregon State University's online course require 180. From anthropologists with a median salary of $63,940 to historians earning $64,540 annually, the field offers a plethora of different occupational options.\n\n7. Bachelor of Arts in Psychology\n\nAverage Salary: $69,000\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why psychology is one of the highest-paying careers in the US is the pressing need for the profession in the country. With over 50 million American adults facing mental health issues and a major portion not receiving essential care as of 2022, the demand for psychologists is undeniably high. Despite the prevalence of conditions like depression and anxiety, many individuals remain untreated.\n\n6. Bachelor of Arts in Communications\n\nAverage Salary: $70,000\n\nA communications college degree holds paramount importance in today's media landscape. According to a recent survey by Boston University's College of Communication, 72% of Americans acknowledge the need of media literacy skills to combat misinformation. However, only 42% know how to access quality media literacy training online. This explains why it is becoming one of the most popular degree choices as it is also one of the easiest degrees to make money.\n\nClick here to see the 5 Easiest Degrees That Pay Well.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n12 Best Countries to Teach English Without a Degree 20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees 15 College Degrees With the Best Starting Salaries\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Easiest Degrees That Pay Well is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has delivered impressive gains to investors over the past five years, with shares of the tech giant rising close to 250% during this period and outpacing the S&P 500 index's gains of 77% by a big margin. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's robust rally can be attributed to the growing prominence of its high-margin services business, as well as a tremendous smartphone upgrade cycle triggered by the arrival of 5G smartphones.\n\nHowever, Apple stock has lost its luster in 2024. It is down nearly 5%, and has underperformed the S&P 500 so far.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, led by celebrated investor Warren Buffett, has reduced its Apple stake by 13%. Moreover, analysts and investors are concerned that Apple has been late to capitalize on hot tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI). Rivals such as Samsung are using AI to boost smartphone sales, while Apple's latest results indicate that the demand for iPhones is waning.\n\nHowever, a closer look at Apple's potential catalysts indicates that the tech giant could turn out to be a solid investment over the next five years as well.\n\nMultiple growth drivers could get Apple out of its rut\n\nApple released fiscal 2024 second-quarter results (for the three months ended March 30, 2024) on May 2, and shares of the company popped nearly 6%. The jump in Apple's stock price was driven by the company's better-than-expected numbers. It earned $1.53 per share on revenue of $90.8 billion, while analysts were expecting $1.51 per share on earnings on $90.5 billion in revenue.\n\nAnd this was not the only reason why investors cheered Apple's report. The company increased its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share. Additionally, Apple announced a share repurchase authorization worth a whopping $110 billion, the largest in U.S. history. Moreover, positive management commentary about the company's prospects and CEO Tim Cook's comments that Apple is investing in generative AI seem to have bolstered investor sentiment further.\n\nMore specifically, Cook pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the company is \"making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\" These developments are probably the reason why investors overlooked the year-over-year decline in Apple's revenue and earnings last quarter.\n\nThe company's top line was down 4% year over year, while the bottom line fell by a penny. Apple's revenue from its largest product line, the iPhone, fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion in the year-ago period. If Apple is indeed investing significantly in generative AI, it wouldn't be surprising to see the company equip its next-generation iPhones with AI-focused features.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's much needed right now considering that Apple's rival Samsung is already reaping the benefits of offering AI-specific features on its latest Galaxy flagship phones. The South Korean giant points out that half of the customers purchasing the Galaxy S24 smartphone family were doing so because of the integrated AI functions. More importantly, 60% of the people buying the S24 devices have been regularly using the AI functions on offer.\n\nNot surprisingly, AI is expected to become the next big growth driver for the smartphone industry. According to Counterpoint Research, shipments of generative AI-capable smartphones could grow four times over between 2024 and 2027, with cumulative shipments crossing one billion units by 2027. More importantly, Counterpoint is expecting Apple to enter the generative AI smartphone market in 2024 and become the leading smartphone OEM (original equipment manufacturer) in this space from 2025.\n\nApple's track record indicates that it could indeed become the leading player in AI smartphones despite being late. Samsung, for instance, launched 5G smartphones in 2019. Apple was a year late -- the iPhone 12, launched in 2020, was its first 5G device. Even then, Apple quickly climbed the charts and started dominating the 5G smartphone market in a short time.\n\nAppleInsider points out that Apple reportedly has a large language model (LLM) that will allow it to deploy multiple AI-focused features into its next iPhone, ranging from text summarization in apps such as Siri, Safari, and Messages to generating responses to users' queries akin to a chatbot. These features should help encourage Apple's user base to upgrade to its upcoming iPhones and also allow the company to make a dent in the fast-growing AI smartphone space.\n\nAs such, don't be surprised to see the iPhone return to growth thanks to the AI revolution, which probably explains why analysts are expecting an uptick in its bottom-line growth.\n\nStronger earnings growth could lead to impressive stock price gains\n\nApple's earnings remained nearly flat in fiscal 2023 (which ended in September 2023) at $6.13 per share. As the following chart indicates, the tech giant's earnings growth is expected to gain momentum in the current fiscal year and get stronger over the next couple of years. AAPL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAnalysts are expecting Apple to sustain double-digit earnings growth of 11% for the next five years. Based on its fiscal 2023 earnings of $6.13 per share, its bottom line could jump to $10.33 per share in five years. Apple has a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 28, which is a small discount to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 29.5.\n\nAssuming it continues to trade at 28 times earnings in five years and achieves $10.33 in earnings at the end of the forecast period, its stock price could jump to $289. That would be a 57% increase from current levels.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Sold Apple and Paramount. Here's What He's Buying Instead.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett hasn't found a lot to like in the stock market recently.\n\nIn each of the last six quarters, Buffett has sold more stocks for Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) than he bought. Last quarter, he sold off a big chunk of his Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) position and the entirety of his Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA) investment. All told, he sold nearly $20 billion worth of stocks from Berkshire's portfolio, and he bought less than $3 billion.\n\nBuffett lamented investment opportunities for Berkshire are few and far between as the company grows bigger. With a market cap of about $877 billion, there are only so many investments that can move the needle for the conglomerate. So, when Buffett does add to an existing position or initiate a new one, investors should pay attention, as it could be a big opportunity for anyone following his lead. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhy is Buffett selling Apple and Paramount?\n\nBuffett trimmed about 13% of his Apple position in the first quarter, leaving Berkshire with just under 800 million shares.\n\nApple remains Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity position by far, representing around 40% of the portfolio. And Buffett said it's \"extremely likely\" Apple will remain the largest holding in the portfolio at the end of the year. That's despite selling off shares in each of the last two quarters.\n\nSo, why did Buffett sell? In a word: taxes.\n\nBuffett thinks paying taxes now on the massive capital gain for Berkshire's Apple shares is a smart move.\n\n\"We are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking on Apple. And that rate was 35% not that long ago, and it's been 52% in the past,\" he told the audience in Omaha at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. \"I would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give, and I think that higher taxes are quite likely.\"\n\nSo, Buffett is taking the tax hit now because he thinks there's a good chance the taxes will be higher in the future. \"If I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it at a higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he added.\n\nBuffett also sold shares of Apple in 2019 and 2020 for tax purposes. In 2021, he admitted that was probably a mistake. Still, with the massive run in Apple shares since then, Buffett thought it would be worth it to take the tax bill on the gains now. He could always add shares back to the position if the opportunity presents itself.\n\nWith regard to Paramount, Buffett admitted that he's learned a lot about how people value their leisure time and what a successful entertainment business looks like. Based on his sale of Paramount stock over the last two quarters, taking his stake from over 93 million shares to zero, it's safe to say he no longer thinks Paramount has the assets that make a great entertainment company. \"I think I'm smarter now than I was a couple of years ago,\" he noted. \"But I also think I'm poorer because I acquired the knowledge in the manner that I did.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's Buffett buying?\n\nAs mentioned, there are only a handful of opportunities Buffett sees in the stock market, and his stock purchases reflect that sentiment.\n\nDuring the quarter, he bought just $2.7 billion worth of stocks.\n\nAbout $1 billion of that went to purchase shares of the Liberty SiriusXM(NASDAQ: LSXMA)(NASDAQ: LSXMK) tracking stocks. The tracking stocks are designed to reflect Liberty Media's stake in Sirius XM(NASDAQ: SIRI), of which it owns 83%. Buffett and his team have preferred the tracking stock as it offers a discount relative to buying Sirius XM shares directly, and may better reflect the intrinsic value of Sirius XM's business. The two stocks are set to merge in the third quarter of this year.\n\nBuffett also added a small amount to his stake in Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). He praised Occidental's assets and CEO Vicki Hollub at the shareholder meeting and said it's an investment he plans to maintain indefinitely in his 2023 letter to shareholders. After a relatively small purchase in February, Berkshire owns a 28% stake in the business.\n\nThere were a few other stock purchases as well, but we'll have to wait for Berkshire Hathaway to file its quarterly form 13-F disclosing every position with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe only other stock purchase that's been made known is Buffett's $2.2 billion share repurchase of Berkshire Hathaway. He's bought back shares every quarter since the board approved a new policy enabling him to repurchase Berkshire stock whenever he determines the stock is trading below its intrinsic value. He continues to prefer discretionary share repurchases as a means of returning capital to shareholders instead of dividends.\n\nBuffett's biggest purchase, by far, was not a stock. It was U.S. Treasuries. Berkshire Hathaway uses short-term Treasury bills as a place to store cash. Buffett has long preferred short-duration bonds over long-duration bonds, as they provide more flexibility and less interest rate risk. And with high short-term rates in the current environment, he's getting a great return to just sit on cash. He added over $21 billion in cash and short-term Treasuries to Berkshire's balance sheet last quarter.\n\n\"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position,\" he told shareholders. \"When I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets ... we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nUntil there is a decline in stock prices or interest rates (or both), it shouldn't surprise anyone if Buffett continues to buy Treasuries. He told the audience the total cash and equivalents position could exceed $200 billion this quarter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWhen you don't even realize your money decisions are keeping you from unlocking greater wealth, you in effect have the \"oh sh*t\" moment that Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and yours truly had at the Milken Institute conference this week after chatting with Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik.\n\nMailik calls the investment shots for the money-managing giant, which boasts $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Suffice to say, she wasn't on board with my 5% CD or Akiko's high-yield savings account.\n\nIn effect, we are part of the crowd making one of the biggest investing mistakes Mailik continues to see as she travels the world to communicate with investors.\n\n\"Cash on the sidelines [is one of the biggest mistakes], Malik said. \"Studies have shown that when you market time, you lose money relative to if you just stayed invested. This started last year as everyone expected a recession to come. They are holding their cash and 5% returns.\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong with 5% returns, but when the market is up, multiples of that and even fixed-income markets have yields that are higher than that today, [so] you're losing relative money. So I really recommend staying invested.\"\n\nMalik does make a valid point.\n\nThe S&P 500 returned 23% in 2023, including dividends, according to Bernstein data. Municipal bonds generated more than a 5% return. A 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds delivered over 17%.\n\nMoney market funds only yielded 3%, per Bernstein. Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik says put that money to work! Malik (right) talks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi and anchor Akiko Fujita at the Milken Institute Conference. (Yahoo Finance) (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThis year alone, the S&P 500 is up roughly 10% — getting the pep back in its step following a jobs report letdown.\n\nGrocery prices are up nearly 30% since 2019, and here I am crowing about a 5% seven-month CD.\n\n\"5% was good in 2014,\" Malik ribbed me.\n\nSilly Sozzi.\n\nSo with some $6 trillion currently parked in money market funds (aka \"cash on the sidelines\"), it's reasonable to think some of that gets put to work in 2024 amid more clarity on interest rates and the economy.\n\nMalik unsurprisingly suggests investing in stocks.\n\nShe likes defensive stocks that peddle infrastructure. Apple and Amazon could also be viewed as defensive plays, given their strong fundamentals, Malik says.\n\nOne other investing mistake to avoid while I have you: going all in on the Mag Seven such as Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Top names in finance, like Apollo's (APO) Marc Rowan (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management) and Avenue Capital Management's Marc Lasry, struck a cautious note on the Mag Seven trade in interviews with us at Milken.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow off to Bank of America I go!\n\nCurious on how to put cash to work in tech stocks beyond the Mag Seven?

        "title": "The Surprising Reason the S&amp;P 500 Is Starting to Look Cheap",
        "content": "One of the easiest ways to get a reading on whether the market is overvalued is to look at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500. With a P/E of 27, the index looks expensive compared to historic levels.\n\nBut the market is forward looking and cares more about where companies are going than where they have been. Let's dive into some encouraging market data that indicates the S&P 500 might not be as expensive as it looks at first glance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe data\n\nNew findings from business data firm FactSet Research Systems show that 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings. For the quarter, the growth rate for the S&P 500 is 5%, the highest level since Q2 2022. Earnings growth has been incredibly strong -- so strong, in fact, that the forward P/E of the S&P 500 is now 19.9.\n\nAccording to FactSet, that level is still above the five-year average of 19.1 and the 10-year average of 17.8, but it is lower than levels seen at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year on March 31.\n\nAccording to Luxembourg-based ISABELNET, a firm that has been doing private research on the U.S. stock market since 1998, consensus analyst estimates for the S&P 500 are $242 for 2024 earnings and $278 for 2025. At a level around 5,200, that would give the S&P 500 a P/E of 21.5 based on the 2024 forecast and 18.7 based on 2025 estimates.\n\nHere's a look at how the forward P/E has performed over the last five years and how it is expected to fall to around 20 by Q2 2025. S&P 500 P/E Ratio Forward Estimate Chart\n\nIn sum, growth is strong, earnings are delivering, and the S&P 500 is at a reasonable valuation.\n\nFaster growth justifies a higher multiple\n\nThe composition of the S&P 500 is currently more growth oriented than in the past.\n\nThe technology sector makes up 29.3% of the index. Consumer discretionary, dominated by Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), makes up 10.4%. Communications services -- heavily weighted in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- makes up 9.2%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, which mirrors the performance of the S&P 500, has 30% of its weighting in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a term for seven top tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Nvidia alone now makes up more than 5% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe shift toward growth and tech has led to dramatic changes in the S&P 500 and fueled strong gains in the index led by megacap growth stocks. Growth stocks tend to fetch a premium valuation relative to their trailing earnings because investors are willing to pay up for the prospect of future earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith more and more of the S&P 500 allocated to growth stocks, it stands to reason its valuation should be higher than historic levels. By the same token, if the most valuable companies were instead safe, stodgy dividend-paying behemoths, we would expect the S&P 500's multiple to be lower than prior levels.\n\nTo see how growth can make an expensive stock look more affordable, let's look at the forward earnings estimates of the Magnificent Seven. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nNotice that Alphabet and Meta Platforms have roughly the same forward P/E as the S&P 500 despite being high-quality cash cows with above-average growth prospects and impeccable balance sheets.\n\nEven Nvidia, which embodies artificial intelligence-fueled market euphoria, has a 35.9 forward P/E -- which is less than half of its current 75.9 P/E ratio -- because consensus analyst estimates expect Nvidia's earnings to double over the next year.\n\nFocus on fundamentals\n\nThe stock market can do just about anything in the short term. But over the long term, it's all about how much money companies are making and how much they are expected to make in the future.\n\nIf you were to look solely at big tech stock prices or the levels of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, you might conclude that this market rally looks overextended. But earnings have delivered and are backing up the rally.\n\nThe lesson here is that price doesn't dictate value. Growth stocks were way oversold at the end of 2022, so there was some initial catching up to do in 2023. But the rally has persisted since then because of earnings growth.\n\nOverall, the stock market looks healthy and is going up for generally the right reasons. But there will always be pockets of speculation and greed.\n\nTo filter out the noise, focus on the underlying investment theses of the companies you like: their performance, what's driving or hindering results, and whether the valuation makes sense. This approach will help ensure you invest in a company for the right reasons and will allow you to stay on an even keel no matter how choppy the market becomes.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,115!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $34,588!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $329,437!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of May 6, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "GOOG Stock Analysis: Unlocking the Future Potential of Alphabet in 2024",
        "content": "Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, advocates owning a small group of stocks. He’s willing to ride these best ideas for years. One of those best ideas is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.38 million Class C and 4.35 million Class A shares. Together, Pershing has nearly $2 billion in Alphabet stock.\n\nAckman’s stake in Google’s parent company accounts for more than 18.5% of his firm’s $10.4 billion in assets reported in its Q4 2023 13-F. With the two share classes combined, Alphabet is Pershing’s second-highest holding by percentage, surpassed only by Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) at just less than 19%.\n\nExcept for Lowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW), each of Pershing’s seven holdings has a weighting of at least 11%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou could argue that Alphabet stock should be the hedge fund’s largest position. Here’s why.\n\nFree Cash Flow and Alphabet Stock\n\nThrough Q1 2024, Alphabet’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $69.11 billion, 21.7% of its $318.15 billion in revenue. Adding up the trailing 12-month free cash flow of Pershing’s other six holdings, it comes to $11.88 billion, or about one-sixth Alphabet’s.\n\nBased on the other six’s combined revenue of $129.08 billion, the average margin is 9.2%, less than half of Alphabet’s.\n\nFree Cash Flow Margins — Pershing Square Capital Management Holdings\n\nCompany Free Cash Flow (TTM) Revenue (TTM) Margin Alphabet $69.11 billion $318.15 billion 21.7% QSR International $1.25 billion $7.17 billion 17.4% Lowe’s Companies $6.18 billion $86.38 billion 7.2% Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) $1.32 billion $10.20 billion 12.9% Hilton Hotels (NYSE:HLT) $1.74 billion $10.52 billion 16.5% Howard Hughes Holdings (NYSE:HHH) -$266 million $999 million N/A Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) $1.65 billion $13.81 billion 11.9%\n\nAll the other holdings possess healthy free cash flow, except for Howard Hughes, a real estate developer who doesn’t focus on this financial metric. You can’t go out of business if you bring in more cash than you send out.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Pershing cut its Lowe’s holdings by 82%. Ackman likely left some money on the table as LOW stock hit a 52-week high of $262.49 in March. I would not be surprised if Pershing sold out of its Lowe’s position in the first quarter, given it paid an average of $100.43 a share.\n\nIf you take out Lowe’s numbers, the free cash flow margin for the other five stocks jumps to 13.3% [free cash flow of $5.70 billion divided by $42.70 billion], 840 basis points less than Alphabet.\n\nThere is no question that Alphabet is the best free cash flow generator.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Does It Compare to the Other Magnificent 7 Stocks?\n\nThere are 64 analysts covering GOOG/GOOGL stock, with 50 rating it a Buy with a $195 target price, 14% higher than where it currently trades. So, that’s 78% of analysts rating it a Buy.\n\nHere’s how it compares to the other Mag 7 stocks.\n\nAnalyst Buy Rating Percentages — Magnificent 7 Stocks\n\nCompany # of Analysts  Buy Rating % Alphabet 64 78% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 46 65% Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 59 95% Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) 65 97% Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 59 88% Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) 51 41% Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) 67 85%\n\nAt least from the perspective of analysts, Alphabet is not the favorite Mag 7 stock.\n\nI won’t review all the free cash flow margins for the other six Mag 7 stocks. However, Amazon, which has the highest Buy percentage at 97%, has a free cash flow margin of 7.7% based on $45.70 billion in TTM free cash flow and $590.74 billion in revenue.\n\nIn fairness to Amazon, if you exclude its e-commerce revenue, the free cash flow generation is much stronger. With all it has going with its ad business and AI, its free cash in about five years will be considerably more impressive. It’s not hard to see why so many analysts rate it a buy.\n\nNext up is Microsoft, which has a 95% Buy percentage. It’s more of an apples-to-apples comparison. Its free cash flow margin is 29.8% based on $70.58 billion in TTM free cash flow and $236.58 billion in revenue.\n\nSatya Nadella is one of the best CEOs in America. Since taking the helm on Feb. 4, 2014, MSFT stock is up 1020%, 544 percentage points higher than Alphabet over the same period.\n\nMSFT is the class of the Mag 7.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nLast December, I wrote about how Alphabet was spending money in all the wrong places. Notably, it had repurchased more than $100 billion of its stock over the previous two years. And while its underperforming shares made some buybacks worthwhile, it should have invested at least 50% of these funds in its business.\n\nThe company’s employees are fed up with shareholders getting all the benefits of its strong free cash flow.\n\n“Despite the company’s stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases,” Fortune reportedCNBC comments made by an employee after the company’s blowout quarter. “When will employee compensation fairly reflect the company’s success and is there a conscious decision to keep wages lower due to a cooling employment market?”\n\nIf you can only buy one Mag 7 stock, Microsoft is the call. However, Alphabet’s free cash flow always keeps it in the mix.\n\nAlphabet is a Moderate Buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock. The Reason Why Is Eye-Opening.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) have been nearly synonymous with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) since taking a position in the stock in 2014. The investment (and all the stock they bought along the way) turned out to be smart and made Berkshire a substantial profit.\n\nHowever, Berkshire has started to sell Apple stock despite voicing its belief in the business. At one point, Apple made up more than half of Berkshire's investment portfolio; now, it has retreated to less than 40%.\n\nSo why is Berkshire reducing its stake in one of Buffett's favorite companies? The answer may surprise you.\n\nBerkshire's unrealized gains in Apple are a big reason for its sales\n\nBuffett is a value investor, but he's also one to hold on to a stock if it's winning. This is an excellent strategy, and it's one that many should emulate. However, there is one drawback: taxes.\n\nIf an investor has held a stock for more than a year, any profit they make is taxed at the long-term capital gains rate. For individual investors, this maxes out at 20%, depending on your income. For corporations, it's a flat 21%. This means that for every dollar in profit that Berkshire makes from Apple stock, $0.21 goes to the U.S. government.\n\nIn Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2024, Buffett mentioned that they don't mind paying taxes, but it sees the writing on the wall. Buffett mentioned that the rate was 35% not long ago and as high as 52% earlier in his career. After looking at the current political environment, he doesn't see those taxes decreasing, and most likely they will increase.\n\nIn the most recent State of the Union Address, President Joe Biden called for raising the corporate income tax rate to 28%, so Buffett's assessment seems valid.\n\nAs a result, Berkshire is taking action and capturing some of those gains before it's forced to pay higher taxes.\n\nDuring the meeting, Buffett reiterated a few times that Apple would remain its largest holding even if it continued to sell stock. However, I don't think selling Apple stock is a bad idea, especially after the quarter it just posted.\n\nBuffett may be selling for taxes, but you may want to sell for a different reason\n\nApple's business is not what it once was. Consumers aren't upgrading their products as often, and Apple has struggled to launch a new hit product. The Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset, for example, isn't flying off the Apple Store shelves. iPhone sales are sliding, too. As a result, Apple's revenue fell from $94.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 to $90.8 billion (ending March 30) in FY 2024. This decline is just a continuation of a pattern that has been present since the start of 2023.\n\nStory continues AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite that, Apple has managed to improve its gross profit, which trickled down to the bottom line, and has kept earnings per share (EPS) flat compared to last year.\n\nIt's clear that Apple's core business (besides its services division) is struggling, but Apple's management is a world-class team, so the business' profits don't reflect these struggles.\n\nDespite that, Apple's stock still trades for a premium valuation: 28 times forward earnings.\n\nWith the S&P 500 index trading at a much less pricey 21 times forward earnings, it's clear the market still holds Apple in high esteem.\n\nI'm less convinced, and until Apple's core business starts improving, I don't want to be anywhere near the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "What happened to 3D printing stocks?",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the performance and developments surrounding 3D printing stocks.\n\nA big reasons Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is widely credited to be one of the most advanced personal computing companies in the world is the firm's ability to blend in a device's design with high end specifications. A key aspect of product design is manufacturing, which has slowly grown to become one of the most advanced industries in the world. Advances in manufacturing have also nearly completely re shaped the landscape of today's technologies, with one high end manufacturing category, i.e. 3D printing or additive manufacturing, reshaping the way designers, businesses, and consumers produce and order gadgets.\n\n3D printing's utility allows high end jet engine manufacturers, such as General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) subsidiary Pratt & Whitney to fabricate complex components with high degrees of precision. At the same time, it also enables firms like the Ireland based medical device manufacturer Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to create life like models of human organs such as the heart for testing, training, and other uses. For a detailed look at how GE and others are using 3D printing, you should read 10 Best 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhile the allure of 3D printing to transform industries and generate revenue has always been strong, these stocks, like others that require significant capital investment, fluctuate in response to economic conditions. As proof, consider the performance of the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF). It is one of the earliest collections of 3D printing stocks which predates Ark Investment's well known The 3D Printing ETF (BATS:PRNT). Year to date, the Solactive index is down by 2.4%. However, the 3D printing stock index closed 3.9% higher on April 11th, which has proven as one of the most important stock market dates this year. The following day, markets and investor sentiment reworked their expectations for interest rate cuts later this year after evaluating fresh inflation data and earnings from big banks and saw them struggle with high costs which disappointed Wall Street estimates for net interest income. You can read more about this turmoil by clicking on 20 Most Profitable Banks in the US in 2024.\n\nShifting gears, while 3D printing stocks have responded negatively to investors shifting their rate cut expectations forward, individual stocks might be doing better. Some of the oldest 3D printing stocks you're likely to find are Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD). These two have been trading on the stock market since the 1990s, and among them, Startsys's shares have been the better performers. They are up by 466% in all time price gains, for a nice chunk of returns which peaked in 2014 when the shares touched $140. And just as is the case for the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF) these 3D printing stocks also jumped in 2021 after investors and media hyped up the potential offered by printers to create alternatives to traditional supply chain and manufacturing resources that were harmed by the post pandemic lockdowns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese fluctuations are a classic representation of 3D printing stocks, which soar in popularity, see a growth in adoption, and then slowly fade away to bide their time. 2021's 3D printing stock peak also led to this industry joining the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) fever amongst firms eager to try their hand at a public listing. Some 3D printing stocks that went public during this time are Markforged Holding Corporation (NYSE:MKFG), Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE:VLD), and Shapeways Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHPW). Neither of these are stellar performers, and we can't blame them given how high interest rates have gotten since their listing.\n\nOne 3D printing stock that has bucked the trend of being red in 2024 is the Boston based software firm PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC). PTC is an example of the software arm of the 3D printing industry, which benefits from selling manufacturing software firms that rely on 3D printing. This enables it to directly benefit from any growth in the adoption of additive manufacturing technologies. Additionally, in case of a slowdown in 3D printing, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) also benefits from product management and industrial software which allow it to generate recurring revenue. The shares have gained 6.7% year to date, outpacing the gains of all 3D printing stocks in this introduction and the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF).\n\nThe latest bit about this top performing 3D printing stock is for its first quarter earnings. The results saw PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) post $603 million in revenue and $0.95 in earnings per share. These beat analyst estimates of $576 million for revenue and $0.74 for the EPS. At its earnings call, management shared that PTC's Creo software, used primarily in 3D printing applications, had led to an 11% annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth for its CAD business division.\n\nSo, as 3D printing stocks continue to prove to be an interesting bunch, we decided to see which stocks are finding favor with analysts. Analysts spend countless hours pouring over financial statements and business models to decide whether a firm can enhance its cash flow and shareholder value in the future. For 3D printing stocks, their take can provide important insight due to the hurdles that the industry faces with wide scale adoption and the stable potential offered by the software side. Some top 3D printing stocks in this list are Materialise NV (NASDAQ:MTLS), Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS), and FARO Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:FARO). What happened to 3D printing stocks?\n\nminkus-aCniNTiIFd8-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top 3D printing stocks according to analysts, we ranked the constituents of the Solactive 3D Printing Index (CHF) and those selected in our coverage of 13 Best 3D Printing Stocks To Invest In by the average analyst share price target upside and picked out the top stocks.

        "title": "40.2% of Warren Buffett's $362 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett was born in 1930, and he bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his own investment company called Berkshire Hathaway, which he still leads today.\n\nBuffett has steered Berkshire to a total return of 4,384,748% over the last 58 years, which would have been enough to turn a $1,000 investment into more than $43.8 million. The same investment in the S&P 500 index over the same period would be worth just $312,230.\n\nBerkshire's incredible run of success stems from a simple strategy. Buffett likes to own companies with steady growth, sound profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes companies returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. One thing he has never done is chase the latest stock market trend, whether it be the internet, cloud computing, or now, artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith that said, many of the stocks owned by Berkshire have turned their attention to the AI revolution. Two of them account for a combined 40.2% of the conglomerate's $362 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities today. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nE-commerce was Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) primary business when it was founded in 1994, but the company has since expanded into cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and AI. Berkshire didn't buy Amazon stock until 2019, and Buffett has often expressed regret for not recognizing the opportunity sooner. Today, Amazon's $1.9 trillion valuation makes it the world's fifth-largest company.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud services by revenue globally. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses thrive in the digital age, and it has also become a distribution platform for many of Amazon's AI initiatives. CEO Andy Jassy wants to dominate the three core layers of AI: infrastructure (chips and data centers), large language models (LLMs), and customer-facing AI applications.\n\nLike most cloud providers, AWS offers customers infrastructure powered by Nvidia's industry-leading graphics chips (GPUs), which were designed for processing AI workloads. However, it has also designed its own chips, and Jassy says there is strong demand for its latest Trainium 2 hardware because of its attractive pricing and performance.\n\nAWS also continues to expand its Bedrock platform, which is home to a growing number of ready-made LLMs. Building an LLM requires substantial amounts of data and financial resources, so using an existing model can accelerate the development of AI applications. Amazon built its own family of models called Titan, but AWS customers can also access models from leading start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon recently invested $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo cover the third and final layer, Amazon recently launched an AI virtual assistant called Q. It's capable of analyzing the internal data of any business to provide useful insights, and it can also write, test, and debug computer code to speed up the release of new software. It's the ultimate productivity tool for AWS customers.\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in total revenue last year, which was more than any of its tech peers in the trillion-dollar club. However, while the company has been profitable over the last three quarters, it has historically generated consistent losses because it favored investing heavily in growth. Combined with the absence of a dividend or buyback program, it doesn't tick many of Buffett's usual boxes.\n\nThat could explain why Amazon stock represents just 0.5% of Berkshire's portfolio. However, the conglomerate might wish it owned a larger stake in the coming years as the AI opportunity unfolds.\n\n2. Apple: 39.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBuffett certainly hasn't shown much hesitation when buying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. Berkshire first invested in the iPhone maker in 2016, and it has spent around $38 billion accumulating shares since then. Thanks to a significant increase in stock price, Berkshire's stake in Apple is currently worth a whopping $143.5 billion, even after discounting the recent sale of 13% of the conglomerate's position.\n\nThe iPhone is Apple's flagship product, but it has an entire portfolio of hardware successes, including the iPad, Watch, Mac computers, and iPhone accessories like the AirPods. Apple also has a growing number of services, which include Apple Music, Apple News, Apple TV, and iCloud, to name just a few. These services are typically subscription-based and carry much higher profit margins than Apple's hardware products, so they are frequently a point of focus for investors.\n\nApple didn't become a $2.8 trillion company by standing still, and while it has been less vocal about its AI aspirations than other tech giants, it could make a significant dent on the emerging industry. There was an early clue inside the latest iPhone 15 Pro. It's fitted with a new Apple-designed A17 Pro chip, which enhances the smartphone's ability to process AI workloads, like those underpinning the Siri voice assistant and autocorrect keyboard function.\n\nIn March, rumors began to fly that Apple was in partnership talks with leading developers of AI chatbots like Alphabet (Google) and OpenAI. These applications could help Apple's customers rapidly craft content, from emails to images, on their devices. They could also become virtual assistants capable of everything from answering complex questions to offering gift suggestions.\n\nIf history is any guide, Apple could charge those companies billions of dollars to have their AI chatbots installed on its 2.2 billion active devices worldwide. After all, Apple already charges Alphabet around $18 billion per year to set Google as the default search engine on its Safari browser -- a similar fee for Alphabet's Gemini chatbot would not be surprising. More will likely be revealed about Apple's AI plans at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\n\nNotably, Apple meets most of Buffett's criteria. It delivers steady revenue growth in most years, it's highly profitable, and its CEO Tim Cook regularly receives Buffett's praise. Plus, Apple pays a regular dividend, and it just announced a new stock buyback program worth $110 billion, which is the largest in corporate history.\n\nSo why did Berkshire recently sell 13% of its position in Apple? Buffett says it was for tax reasons (he speculates that corporate taxes could rise in the future), but he assured investors Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest position at the end of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "67.3% of Warren Buffett's $361 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 4 Stocks",
        "content": "Personal finance experts preach the importance of diversifying your portfolio. Having too much money invested in a single stock opens the door for wild swings in your wealth. One unexpected change in the company, the industry, or government regulations could wipe out a good chunk of your portfolio's value.\n\nWarren Buffett doesn't think diversification is always necessary when it comes to constructing a portfolio. He's gone so far as to say, \"Diversification is a protection against ignorance.\" In Buffett's opinion, if you know how to analyze a business, its industry, and its stock, there's no need to own more than a few wonderful companies.\n\nTrue to form, Buffett puts his money where his mouth is. A whopping 67.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) $361 billion portfolio is invested in just four stocks. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple (40.1%)\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is, by far, the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. Buffett accumulated shares almost every quarter from the start of 2016 through the third quarter of 2018, resulting in a position equivalent to over 1 billion shares of the stock today. He's trimmed the position a few times since then, including each of the last two quarters, but Berkshire still holds nearly 800 million shares.\n\nImportantly, despite Buffett's sales, Berkshire's stake in Apple hasn't declined nearly as much thanks to the tech company's share repurchase program. That's one of the big reasons Buffett loves the stock so much. Apple has reduced its share count by over 18% since the start of 2019. As a result, despite selling over 20% of its shares, Berkshire's stake in Apple has only fallen from about 5.4% to about 5.1%. Apple just announced it's adding $110 billion to its share repurchase authorization.\n\nOf course, there's a lot to like about Apple besides its massive capital return program supported by steady cash flows. Buffett has praised CEO Tim Cook, and he called Apple \"a better business than any we own,\" at Berkshire's 2023 shareholder meeting.\n\nThe iPhone may be the most successful consumer product in history. Cook's ability to leverage the popularity of the device into a growing services business has been a key driver of growing profit margin in the company. It also reinforces the Apple ecosystem, building a bigger moat around the business and ensuring more predictability to Apple's revenue. Despite Berkshire's recent sales, Buffett told investors it's \"extremely likely\" Apple will remain Berkshire's largest holding.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Bank of America (10.6%)\n\nBuffett bought the bulk of Berkshire's stake in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) in 2011. At the time he committed $5 billion to the bank in exchange for preferred shares paying a 6% dividend. But the deal also came with a warrant to purchase 700 million shares for $7.14 each. Buffett made the decision to exercise that warrant in 2017, giving it a 6.8% stake in the company. He subsequently added shares in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2023, resulting in a 13.1% stake in the business.\n\nBank of America has struggled recently amid the high interest rate environment. A larger portion of its balance sheet contains long-duration bonds compared to the rest of the industry. As a result, it's been earning lower interest rates on its holdings while being forced to pay higher interest rates due to the Fed's interest rate hikes over the past 18 months. That's seen in its net interest income, which decreased 3% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nBank of America's fortunes should turn around, however, as interest rates eventually come down. The near-term reaction of the Fed's higher-for-longer rhetoric could present an opportunity for investors.\n\nBank of America has proven to have considerable staying power and is capable of managing through hardships. Despite major setbacks from the 2008-09 financial crisis, the bank has recovered to become one of the biggest retail bankers in the country. Buffett saw this early enough to make a substantial investment. But his continued purchases, especially noteworthy in 2023 amid rising interest rates, indicate he still sees opportunity in Bank of America.\n\n3. American Express (9.7%)\n\nBuffett started buying shares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) in the early 1990s. And similar to Apple, American Express has repurchased a hefty number of shares almost every year. Today, Berkshire's stake in the credit card issuer is 21.1%. Buffett said he plans to maintain Berkshire's position in Amex indefinitely in his most recent letter to shareholders.\n\nAmerican Express is a unique business. Unlike other credit card issuers, American Express owns the payment network its payment cards use. So, where banks are heavily reliant on the interest their credit card users pay on their balance, American Express relies on the amount its customers spend on their cards. The company collects a small percentage from merchants for each purchase on its network.\n\nSeventy-six percent of total revenue came from payment processing and annual fees charged to cardholders in the first quarter. That said, a growing portion of Amex's revenue comes from interest charged on balances. That's due mostly to shifting target demographics among cardholders.\n\nStill, most of Amex's cardholders spend more than average and pay their credit card bills in full every month, thanks to its longtime focus on higher-income individuals and small businesses.  But with the vast majority of spending coming from consumer cards, it gives it strong protection against an economic slowdown and rising inflation rates, as individuals with higher incomes are less likely to change their spending habits than lower-income households in those situations. Because of its business model, American Express is more susceptible to big changes in consumer spending than other credit card issuers. But the types of card users it attracts make it more protected against loan defaults.\n\nAs a perma-bull on the U.S. economy, it's no wonder Buffett likes American Express' business model.\n\n4. Coca-Cola (6.9%)\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is one of Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held equity positions. Buffett's first purchases date back to 1988 and 1989. Today, Berkshire's share of the business stands at 9.3%.\n\nCoca-Cola is a classic Buffett investment. Its strong brand and major cost advantages afforded to it by its scale give it a wide economic moat, as Buffett would call it. That is, it has a sustainable competitive advantage that affords it a much wider gross margin than other companies in the industry.\n\nCoca-Cola's brand strength has been instrumental to its success in recent years amid high inflation. The company's price/mix increased 13% year over year in the first quarter, helping beat foreign exchange headwinds due to hyperinflation in some markets. As a result, net revenue grew 3% year over year in the quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is taking advantage of its global scale to improve operating efficiency and make the most of its supply chain. It showed meaningful progress in improving operating margin in the first quarter, but there's still room to improve. Coca-Cola's global presence and existing relationships with retailers also make it easier for it to introduce new products and enter new verticals, giving it a significant advantage over smaller companies.\n\nBuffett said he wished he'd advised his grandfather to buy Coca-Cola stock back in 1936. Nearly 90 years later, he still thinks it's a great stock to own.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "On May 4, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) released its first-quarter report and hosted its annual meeting of shareholders. While plenty of news came out of the report and the event, the part that stood out was undoubtedly the noticeable decrease in Berkshire's Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) position.\n\nApple stock remains Berkshire's largest holding. But the sell-off might make some investors wonder if Berkshire is getting bearish on the tech stock. Here's some context on its Apple holdings, some justification for the sale, and how to approach the iPhone maker now.

Based on a closing price of $171.48 on March 31 and $192.28 on Dec. 31, we can estimate that Berkshire held around 789,596,454 shares of Apple stock on March 31 compared to 906,490,534 shares on Dec. 31 -- implying a 12.9% decrease in the position between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWhat stands out the most about this particular sale is its size. The largest previous reduction was when Berkshire sold about 93.5 million Apple shares in 2020. This sale is noticeably larger than the 10 million or so shares trimmed between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, which was about a 1% cut.\n\nDuring the annual meeting, Buffett continued to praise Apple and even called it a better business than Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) -- which have been Berkshire holdings for over 30 years.\n\nBut he also indicated that he preferred raising cash in this environment: \"Unless something dramatic happens that really changes capital allocation and strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment. But I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternatives of what's available in equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nBuffett said he would hold a lot of cash even if interest rates were lower. Another reason for the sale was to take advantage of lower federal tax rates on corporate capital gains, which Buffett fears might increase if the government's fiscal policy changes.\n\nHe seems to be battening down the hatches and taking a defensive approach to his current market outlook. Berkshire's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills ballooned to $182.3 billion, up from $163.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe decision to hold cash and a lack of noticeable buys this quarter -- besides the usual repurchase of Berkshire stock -- indicates that the company might view a lot of opportunities as unattractive on a risk/reward basis, especially when compared to holding cash or just repurchasing its own shares.\n\nInterestingly enough, Apple has a sizable cash position of its own. Its trove of $162.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and market securities is nearly as much as Berkshire's cash position.\n\nBuffett has a unique buying style\n\nBuffett has a reputation as a high-conviction investor who is perfectly content with doing nothing for an extended period and then pouncing on a juicy opportunity. In fact, the creation of almost every major Berkshire holding wasn't the result of gradual purchases but rather large blocks in a relatively short time.\n\nBerkshire purchased most of its Coca-Cola stock in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The American Express investment was completed in 1995. According to Stockcircle, which tracks stock purchases of major firms, Berkshire bought 1.01 billion shares of Apple between 2016 and 2018 at a split-adjusted price ranging from just $22.58 a share to $57.09 per share. Apple is worth more than three times the high end of that range today, which makes for a massive gain for Berkshire.\n\nHerein lies the most important point of Berkshire's Apple holding: The only reason the position is so large is because the stock is up so much from when Berkshire began buying it, and its cost basis is so low. If Apple hadn't had that kind of performance over the last few years, it would be closer to the weight of other top holdings like American Express -- which makes up just shy of 10% of the public equity portfolio.\n\nDespite Apple drastically underperforming the S&P 500 and the rest of the tech sector over the last year, the stock is still up big for Berkshire, so it was an easy choice to sell to raise cash.\n\nApple isn't as cheap as it used to be, but it's still a buy\n\nBuffett's commentary in the last few shareholder meetings and annual shareholder letters suggests he still has immense faith in Apple. Berkshire's big bet on the company has the largest payoff -- probably more than Buffett and his team expected in a relatively short period of time.\n\nTrimming Apple makes sense, given this context and Buffett's cautious outlook on the market, and I could see Berkshire continuing to trim the position from here. After all, it still owns a boatload of Apple -- over 5% of the company, in fact.\n\nEven at a 28.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Apple stock isn't expensive, especially for such a high-quality business and when compared to the S&P 500's 27.8 P/E.\n\nBut Apple had just an 11.2 P/E on Jan. 1, 2016, which is hard to believe. Back then, the stock was out of favor, and the high-margin services segment hadn't yet made a material impact on the company. In this vein, it truly was a value play, which is probably why it attracted the attention of Berkshire, which isn't known for taking such large positions in tech stocks.\n\nBerkshire remains heavily invested in various industries that power the U.S. economy, but it is also taking action to build cash. Investors who want to take advantage of a high risk-free rate could follow Berkshire's lead and keep some money in cash.\n\nWhen looking at investors you admire, it's important to understand the context and motives of their decisions. Berkshire's sale of Apple is sizable and, frankly, a bit surprising. It suggests that the easy money has already been made in Apple -- which is probably true for any company valued at close to $3 trillion.\n\nBut it doesn't mean the stock is terribly overvalued or worth avoiding completely. It's highly unlikely Apple will increase in value by the same multiple it has over the last few years, but it still has the fundamentals to outperform the market over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

The workers were dismissed for missing work, showing up late and failing to properly mark their attendance, Apple said. But the Communications Workers of America, CWA, alleged in charges filed with the NLRB last year that the workers were actually fired for their unionization efforts.\n\nNLRB prosecutors originally dismissed the charges last October, but the union filed an appeal in November. On Thursday, the NLRB rejected the appeal, telling the CWA “that the evidence was insufficient to show that the employer discharged the employees because of their protected activities rather than the legitimate business reasons relied on by the employer.”\n\nAn NLRB spokesperson confirmed that the appeal was denied but said that it was still investigating other allegations. The union group alleged that Apple illegally interrogated employees. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nApple has clashed with union groups and the US labor board over the last two years as retail stores in the US push to unionize. So far, only two locations — Oklahoma City and Towson, Maryland — have successfully unionized. A store in Short Hills, New Jersey, is voting this weekend to determine if it should take that step.\n\nAlso this weekend, the Towson location will vote on whether to authorize a strike ahead of new bargaining talks with Apple. The two sides have reached a series of agreements, but none of the terms represent a big change from Apple’s existing policies. The union told employees that there are ongoing negotiations regarding pay, overtime, unpaid leave of absences, time-away benefits and scheduling.\n\nEarlier this month, the US National Labor Relations Board ruled that Apple illegally interrogated staff at its World Trade Center store in New York City.\n\n--With assistance from Josh Eidelson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "title": "Tech Giants Start to Treat Southeast Asia Like Next Big Thing",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Long considered a tech hinterland, Southeast Asia is fast emerging as a center of gravity for the industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Musk Pledges to Grow Supercharger Business He Just Decimated Apple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone Biden Set to Hit China EVs, Strategic Sectors With Tariffs Ice Cube’s Big3 Basketball League Sells Its First Team in $10 Million Deal Jim Simons, Code Breaker Who Mastered Investing, Dies at 86\n\nThe CEOs of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. are among the industry chieftains who’ve swung through the region in past months, committing billions of dollars in investment and holding forth with heads of state from Indonesia to Malaysia. Amazon.com Inc. just this week took over a giant conference hall in downtown Singapore to unfurl a $9 billion investment plan before a thousands-strong audience cheering and waving glow sticks.\n\nAfter decades of playing second fiddle to China and Japan, the region of about 675 million people is drawing more tech investment than ever. For data centers alone, the world’s biggest companies are set to splurge up to $60 billion over the next few years as Southeast Asia’s young populations embrace video streaming, online shopping and generative AI.\n\nTraditionally welcoming to Western investment, the region’s moment has arrived as China turns more hostile to US firms and India remains tougher to navigate politically. Silicon Valley is setting its sights on business-friendly regimes, fast-growing talent pool and rising incomes. The advent of AI is spurring tech leaders to pursue new sources of growth, laying the digital infrastructure of the region’s future.\n\n“Countries like Singapore and Malaysia are largely neutral to the geopolitical tensions happening with China, US, Ukraine and Russia,” said Sean Lim, a managing partner at Singapore-based NWD Holdings, which invests in AI-based projects and other areas. “Especially with the ongoing wars, this region has become more attractive.”\n\nTake Tim Cook and Satya Nadella, who last month embarked on their biggest tours across Southeast Asia in years. The investments they pledged are set to help turn the region into a major battleground between the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google in future frontiers such as artificial intelligence and the cloud.\n\nThe region’s growing workforce is making it a viable alternative to China as a center of talent to support companies’ global operations. As its governments pushed for improvements in education and infrastructure, it’s become an attractive base for everything from manufacturing and data centers to research and design.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The governments are pro cross-border investments and there’s a deep talent pool,” said NWD’s Lim.\n\nSoutheast Asia has also become a sizeable market for gadgets and online services. About 65% of Southeast Asia will be middle class by 2030, with rising purchasing power, according to Singapore government estimates. That’ll help more than double the region’s market for internet-based services to $600 billion, according to estimates by Google, Temasek Holdings Pte and Bain & Co.\n\nApple, whose pricey gadgets for long remained out of reach for the vast majority in the region, is now adding stores. Chief Executive Officer Cook toured Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore in late April, meeting prime ministers and announcing fresh investments as the company seeks new growth regions beyond China, where sales have sputtered.\n\nIn Jakarta, besides pow-wows with the country’s leadership, Cook met a local influencer with almost 800,000 Instagram followers over chicken satay, and learned enough of the local language to say “How are you” in a video circulated on social media. On his X account, local customers asked Cook for an Apple Store and better servicing of Apple products in the country. Following the trip, Apple reported its revenue in Indonesia had reached a record, even as total global sales declined.\n\n“These are markets where our market share is low,” Cook said on a conference call last week. “The populations are large and growing. And our products are really making a lot of progress.”\n\nMicrosoft CEO Nadella also received an enthusiastic welcome after meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand last week. In Bangkok, under a ballroom’s shimmering chandeliers, he was seen shaking hands and conversing with high-ranking government officials and the country’s top business elites.\n\nSoutheast Asia’s draw becomes apparent once you consider slowing toplines in Silicon Valley, which is struggling now to lay the foundations of AI — anticipated to become an industry-defining technology. Within the next few weeks, two major AI-themed events in Singapore are set to feature top leaders from OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft and others to further tout the technology’s promise for Southeast Asia.\n\nA specific catalyst for the tech companies is generative AI, with services like ChatGPT rapidly gaining users. Southeast Asia’s accelerating AI adoption has the potential to add about $1 trillion to the region’s economy by 2030, according to a report by consulting firm Kearney.\n\nThat means more data centers are needed to store and process the massive amounts of information traversing between content creators, companies and customers. Data center demand in Southeast Asia and North Asia is expected to expand about 25% a year through 2028, according to Cushman & Wakefield data. That compares with 14% a year in the US. By 2028, Southeast Asia will become the second largest non-US source of data center revenue in the world.\n\nHotspots include Malaysia’s southern Johor Bahru region, where Nvidia last year teamed up with a local utility for a plan to build a $4.3 billion AI data center park. Nvidia is also targeting Vietnam, which CEO Jensen Huang sees as a potential second home for the company, local media reported during his visit in December. Huang was spotted enjoying street food and egg coffee, a Vietnam specialty, as he hung out with local tech contacts in a black T-shirt and jeans.\n\nThe company has since reviewed Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang as potential locations for investments, with Keith Strier, its vice president of worldwide AI initiatives, touring the cities last month.\n\nA region consisting of about a dozen politically, culturally and geographically disparate countries, Southeast Asia isn’t the easiest market for global companies to operate in. Risks include difficulties navigating local working cultures, as well as the volatility of the various currencies, said NWD’s Lim.\n\nBut for now, the tech majors are embracing the region’s advantages such as its relatively low-cost yet highly skilled workforce — helpful for building expensive technologies such as large language models that require not just a lot of cash but also skilled engineers. Most of the US firms announced training programs with local governments, with Microsoft promising to train a total 2.5 million people in AI skills in Southeast Asia by 2025.\n\n“This shift is influenced by both external and internal drivers,” said Nicholas Lee, associate director in political consultancy firm Global Counsel’s Singapore office. “Besides the intensifying US-China rivalry and policy divergence across major jurisdictions, subdued revenue growth and rising costs also underline the need for companies to manage expenses prudently.”\n\n--With assistance from Chandra Asmara, Norman Harsono, Nguyen Xuan Quynh and Patpicha Tanakasempipat.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- No major app developers have signed up to use outside payment options that Apple Inc. introduced earlier this year for its App Store because the fees they pay would be at least as high as they were before, according to testimony presented to a federal judge.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Musk Pledges to Grow Supercharger Business He Just Decimated Biden Set to Hit China EVs, Strategic Sectors With Tariffs Jim Simons, Code Breaker Who Mastered Investing, Dies at 86 Apple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone Ice Cube’s Big3 Basketball League Sells Its First Team in $10 Million Deal\n\nThe apparent lack of interest in the changes Apple offered as a remedy for anti-competitive practices drew harsh criticism Friday from US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who has been overseeing the technology giant’s court fight with Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. for almost four years.\n\n“It sounds to me as if the goal was to then maintain the business model and revenue you had in the past,” Rogers said to an Apple executive during a multi-day hearing to address Epic’s complaint that the iPhone maker isn’t abiding by the terms of a corrective order the judge issued in 2021.\n\nApple said in January that it would would let all third-party apps sold in the US include an outside link to a developer website to process payments for in-app purchases. Since then, Apple has received just 38 applications for outside links out of an estimated 65,000 app developers that offer in-app purchases, company executives testified.\n\nThe reason: Apple will charge a 27% fee to developers who want to use the link entitlement program — and when combined with payment processing fees, the total is even more than the 30% the App Store has taken for itself for years, the judge was told at the hearing in Oakland, California.\n\nWhy App Store Fees Are Drawing Fire Worldwide: QuickTake\n\nYears of complaints from app developers and scrutiny from governments globally have already forced Apple to rewrite some of the rules protecting its dominance in the app distribution marketplace that generates revenue of more than $200 billion a year.\n\nEpic has argued that Apple’s January revisions to the App Store’s rules don’t amount to meaningful changes, while Apple contends it has delivered the remedy Rogers ordered three years ago following a trial between the two companies.\n\nRogers indicated that Apple hasn’t convinced her it has done enough. Testimony revealed that the 27% fee was approved by a committee that included Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and other top executives.\n\nStory continues\n\n“You’re telling me a thousand people were involved and not one of them said maybe we should consider the cost” to the developers? the judge said. “Not a single person raised that issue of the thousand that were involved?”\n\nNone of the 38 applications for the new outside payments program came from developers of major apps, said Apple’s vice president of finance, Alex Roman.\n\nRead More: Google’s Defeat Threatens $200 Billion App Store Industry\n\nAt one point, an attorney for Epic, Yonatan Even, questioned Roman about whether there is evidence supporting Apple’s claim that the changes it made to the App Store would lower prices for app users.\n\nEven said in addition to Apple’s fees, app developers face costs related to alternative payment solutions. But Apple did no analysis into the latter bucket of costs and still said that its App Store changes would translate to lower prices for users, the lawyer argued.\n\nThe judge seemed to agree.\n\n“I’m looking for data and it sounds like you all made lots of decisions without data,” she said.\n\nThe hearing will continue next week.\n\nThe case is Epic Games Inc. v. Apple Inc., 20-cv-05640, US District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says\n\nThe recent earnings season has made it abundantly clear that the AI revolution is not just knocking on the door but has forcefully entered the tech world.\n\nThe impressive results from tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), AlphabetInc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) underscored this transition, according to Daniel Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush.\n\nThese companies have reported “eye-popping capital expenditure numbers,” initiating an “AI tidal wave” in software and cloud development driven by generative AI.\n\n“The next phase of AI spending is now on the doorstep for the likes of Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and many others,” Ives wrote.\n\nThe expert said companies were “laser-focused on deploying generative AI” across various sectors. Additionally, major players such as Meta and Apple were diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promised significant spending in the coming years.\n\nOther major players like Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are diving deep into AI, heralding a consumer AI cycle that promises significant spending in the coming years.\n\nIves projected AI and related purchases will account for 8%-10% of IT budgets in 2024, a stark increase from less than 1% in 2023. This surge represented a “massive growth catalyst” in what he referred to as the “initial wave of AI software growth.”\n\nIndustry-Wide Impact and Consumer Trends\n\nIves highlighted Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft as leaders in this burgeoning field, with their influence paving the way for a trillion-dollar spending spree over the next decade.\n\nRecent consumer surveys conducted by Wedbush show “broadly positive” trends for Internet-related groups, with expectations of strong digital advertising growth in 2024.\n\n“Our findings strongly support our expectations for accelerating e-commerce and digital advertising growth in 2024,” Ives said, pointing to bullish indicators for Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft’s ‘iPhone Moment’\n\nDescribing the current phase as Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” Ives believed AI would significantly alter the cloud growth trajectory for the company in the coming years. “We see an acceleration of adoption for generative AI and Copilot activity,” he explained.\n\nThis trend is boosting Azure cloud deal flow for Microsoft, with AI use cases “exploding across the enterprise landscape.” Ives estimated that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services, there was an additional $35-$40 of AI spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s Foray into AI\n\nLooking ahead, Ives was particularly excited about Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where he anticipates the unveiling of a comprehensive AI strategy.\n\n“We believe Apple is set to unveil its long-awaited AI strategy to its golden installed base and developer community at WWDC,” he said.\n\nThis includes a new iPad lineup and the iPhone 16, which are expected to set new standards in AI technology.\n\n“The AI strategy at Apple will consist of an AI App Store that will be the foundational starting point for developers and AI apps,” Ives said.\n\nRead Now: Utilities Notch 7th Straight Session Of Gains: ‘Potential Derivative Play To The AI Boom’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Revolution 'On the Doorstep:' The 'Tidal Wave' Is Well Underway, Analyst Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Stocks Surge On Healthy Earnings Season, Rising Jobless Claims: This Week In The Markets\n\nIt's been a quiet week in the markets, marked by a dearth of major economic news and a consistent flow of positive indicators from the first-quarter earnings season.\n\nAs of May 7, 424 companies in the S&P 500 have disclosed their earnings, with 78% surpassing earnings expectations and 61% exceeding revenue forecasts.\n\nThe S&P 500 continued its upward trend, marking its third consecutive week of gains and nearly recouping losses from April, while the Dow Jones boasted eight consecutive sessions in the green.\n\nNotably, the utilities sector, as tracked by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), has emerged as the star performer of 2024, outstripping energy and doubling the tech sector’s performance, with some analysts attributing the outperformance to heightened power demand from data centers.\n\nConcerns surfaced regarding a potential job market slowdown following unexpectedly high weekly jobless claims. The figure reached its highest level in eight months.\n\nThe University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment report revealed a sharper-than-expected dip in May, along with a worrying rise in inflation expectations.\n\nInvestors are now fully factoring in two interest rate cuts by year-end, beginning in September.\n\nAttention now turns to the forthcoming April Consumer Price Index inflation report on Wednesday and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks in Amsterdam on Tuesday.\n\nBuffett Sells Apple Shares\n\nWarren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) has cut its stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by 18%, signaling waning confidence as the tech giant faces challenges in its Chinese market.\n\nApple’s M4 iPads\n\nMeanwhile, Apple unveiled an iPad Pro with a M4 chip and OLED display, and an iPad Air with a M2 chip, enhancing the iPad lineup for the first time since 2022. The iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model — higher price points than older releases.\n\nTesla Cuts Jobs\n\nTeslaInc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has initiated another round of job cuts in China due to intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market, which is increasingly dominated by local rivals.\n\nPfizer Settles Lawsuits\n\nPfizerInc. (NYSE:PFE) has agreed to settle over 10,000 lawsuits related to cancer risks associated with its discontinued heartburn medication Zantac.\n\nNvidia Leads AI\n\nNvidiaCorp.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Used A $20 Flip Phone Until Upgrading To An iPhone Only Four Years Ago — Despite Having Over $100 Billion Invested In Apple",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, the esteemed CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and a symbol of prudent investing, is known for his simple lifestyle and frugal choices, despite his billionaire status.\n\nBuffett used a $20 flip phone for years, even after investing billions in Apple, a company synonymous with cutting-edge technology. This continued use of a basic phone highlighted his preference for simplicity and practicality.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today? 82% of Americans aren’t using this government secured 5% passive income stream, are you one of them?\n\nBuffett’s investment in Apple began in 2016, reflecting a significant engagement with the tech sector. Initially, Berkshire’s investment in Apple was about $35 billion between 2016 and 2018. By the start of 2020, this investment had grown to about $72 billion and further increased to approximately $109 billion by the end of September 2020, reflecting a substantial gain. Throughout 2020, despite some sales of shares, the value of Berkshire’s Apple investment likely ended at around $125 billion, marking a notable 78% growth over the year, according to reports.\n\nDespite his cautious approach to technology, by 2023, Apple had become Berkshire Hathaway’s largest holding. At its peak, Apple shares constituted about half of Berkshire’s U.S. stock portfolio. Although the stake had reduced to the lower-to-mid 40% range with 790 million shares, down from 905 million at the end of the previous year, Buffett’s admiration for Apple and its leadership under CEO Tim Cook remained undiminished.\n\nIn a poignant transition reflective of his trust in Apple, Buffett upgraded to an iPhone in 2020 at the age of 89. During a CNBC interview, he humorously recounted the upgrade from his flip phone, stating, \"I am now using, not very often, the latest model.\" He even joked about a scenario where he might be seen \"crushing with my foot my old flip phone.\"\n\nTrending: If the United States had access to today’s high-yield savings accounts rates in 2015, it wouldn’t need to save another penny.\n\nFurther illustrating his journey into the digital age, Buffett shared that Tim Cook personally helped him navigate the complexities of the iPhone. \"I went out to California, and Tim Cook very patiently spent hours trying to move me up to the level of the average two-year-old,\" Buffett said, humorously noting, \"Didn’t quite make it.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite finally adopting smartphone technology, Buffett admitted he primarily uses his iPhone just to make calls, sticking to his preference for simplicity. His transition from a flip phone to an iPhone in 2020 marked a personal milestone and underscored his commitment to his largest equity investment.\n\nBuffett’s ability to adapt, albeit slowly, to technological advancements, while maintaining his investment philosophy and simple living, demonstrates a balanced approach to embracing modern innovations without letting go of foundational values.\n\nHis experiences and insights, particularly his comments on Apple’s unique consumer loyalty — \"If you're an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000 to give up your iPhone forever, you're not going to take it\" — reflect his deep understanding of the value beyond technology, especially as a user himself.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis platform is offering an industry-leading 5.1% APY on their high-yield savings account. Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Warren Buffett Used A $20 Flip Phone Until Upgrading To An iPhone Only Four Years Ago — Despite Having Over $100 Billion Invested In Apple originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The 3 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Blue-chip stocks all have common denominators that set them apart from other, lesser stocks. They tend to be big, successful businesses that consumers and investors hold in high regard. Their financial statements are typically exemplary, indicating a level of consistency and stability that can allow shareholders to sleep soundly.\n\nLook over the higher-end market caps of S&P 500 stocks and you’ll get a sense of the companies referred to as “blue-chip.” And what you’ll see that they are doing pretty well.\n\nSo far in 2024, blue chip stocks are outperforming both the broad-based index and the small-cap Russell 2000 index. For example, the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (NYSEMKT:FBCG) is up over 16% year-to-date versus 9% for the S&P 500 and less than 2% for the small-cap index.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinding the best blue-chip stocks to buy could be as easy as buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF). You get instant diversification at a relatively low cost. The Fidelity ETF has an expense ratio of just 0.48% and gives you access to over 300 blue-chip stocks.\n\nBut as stock pickers, I like to think we can do better. Below are three blue-chip stocks that are currently undervalued and should provide your portfolio with a fine balance of growth and income.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are down 5% in 2024 and until last week were sitting down more than 13%. Slowing sales in China, iPhone sales not lighting any fires and lagging development in artificial intelligence (AI) all conspired to depress the tech stock’s shares.\n\nYet it just held an iPad event that promises to reignite tablet sales. It has also been deemphasizing China while moving forcefully into India. Weaning itself away from China into more emergent markets could light that fire investors are looking for. An upcoming developers conference bodes well for AI becoming a force for the tech stock as well as the newest iteration of the iPhone. It promises to be feature-rich in AI.\n\nAnd the reason Apple stock bounded higher last week was its announcement of a massive $110 billion share buyback plan. The tech company has so much cash sitting on its balance sheet it doesn’t know what to do with it. While stock repurchases artificially juice earnings per share, it can also signal management’s belief its own stock is undervalued.\n\nApple stock still trades at a premium of 28 times trailing earnings and 7x sales, but as the industry leader, it deserves its premium. With the catalysts outlined above, this blue-chip stock should soon be running higher again.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) Corporate building with Anheuser Busch (BUD) logo on it\n\nSource: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough U.S. beer sales continue to slow, Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) remains an industry behemoth with a vast, global reach. Its recent earnings report indicates just how resilient it can be because of its far-flung operations.\n\nEven as volumes continue falling in the U.S., due in part to A-B’s ill-advised decision to wade into the cultural wars, it showed its strength elsewhere. Volumes jumped by mid-single digits in Latin America core brands including Modelo and Pacifico, driving higher sales in Mexico. Corona did likewise in Brazil.\n\nConstellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) reaps all the benefits of the Modelo and Corona momentum in the U.S., as BUD sold the domestic rights to the brands to gain passage of its acquisition of the brewer. However, A-B retains them elsewhere in the world.\n\nAnheuser-Busch reported a 5% increase in EBITDA to $4.9 billion, which was well above Wall Street’s estimates, while profit margins expanded 90 basis points.\n\nAs happened with Apple, shares of A-B jumped on the good news, easing some of the losses experienced in 2024. BUD stock is down less than 3% this year and at less than 2x sales, it is a historically low valuation. These are levels not seen in over a decade, except for during the pandemic. It marks an excellent time to buy this brewer’s blue-chip stock.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motor (NYSE:TM) is redefining the global auto industry with its big bet on hybrid vehicles. When the rest of the world was going all-in on all-electric cars, Toyota hedged its bets with hybrids. It believed consumers would want the reliability of a gas-powered engine to support an electric option. Its choice proved right.\n\nWhile battery-electric vehicle (BEV) growth is dramatically slowing, hybrid sales are exploding. Toyota saw a dramatic 20% surge in first-quarter sales volume. It says EVs now account for 36.6% of its total sales.\n\nOverall, though, the Japanese automaker’s vehicles are proving popular. That’s led to it having to use fewer incentives to get buyers to purchase, which improves Toyota’s bottom line. It is also building more factories in more countries, which will help it offset currency exchange rate effects now that the Japanese yen is so strong. Foreign exchange impacts were in part the reason Toyota guided toward a 20% decline in operating profits for the full year.\n\nToyota’s compact, fuel-efficient and forward-thinking vehicles have struck a chord with car buyers. Until battery technology catches up with buyer demand, Toyota is investing in new solid-state battery technology. This gives them the ability to purchase fossil-fuel-powered options is a smart strategy.\n\nToyota stock is up 24% year-to-date and 61% higher over the past year. Yet shares still trade at less than 10 times earnings and estimates and at a fraction of sales. While that’s in line with its U.S. counterparts, Toyota Motor sales exhibit robust strength. That makes it the blue-chip stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Earnings-Proof Tech Plays: 3 Stocks Set to Stay Hot Beyond Reporting Season",
        "content": "Depending on where you look, there has been quite a tough crowd of investors to please this earnings season. Indeed, some companies still managed to blow away the numbers. But many firms ran into a road bump, with softer guidance causing investors to sell, even as the quarterly numbers came in just fine (or even ahead of expectations).\n\nIndeed, there are unique applaud-worthy cases, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which sweetened its quarterly showing with a record-breaking share buyback on top of a better-than-expected quarter. Still, not every firm has pockets deep enough to buy back $110 billion worth of shares to top off an already sweet quarter.\n\nExpecting higher guidance alongside big earnings and sales beats every quarter is unrealistic. Even the best companies can’t pull it off every earnings season. As expectations get too high, so do the potential downside risks of falling short going into earnings season.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThree earnings-resilient tech stocks will stay hot after their recent quarterly showings. Though no firm is immune from post-earnings plunges, I see each firm as having plenty of gas in the tank to keep going strong in the second half.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere was a lot to look at in the latest quarterly results for Apple. The big headline was, of course, the historic buyback. Beyond that, iPhone sales were looking rather sluggish, and China remained a notable weak spot (not as weak as expected, though) as economic headwinds and competition weighed.\n\nThat said, Apple CEO Tim Cook sounded optimistic about the Chinese market. Along with a Greater Chinese result (8% year-over-year fall in revenue) that was better than feared, things may just be looking up for Apple after many months’ worth of ominous headlines that shed light on the fact the iPhone is no longer the number-one smartphone seller in China.\n\nUndoubtedly, the iPhone has been facing a great deal of competitive pressures in China of late. But just because the iPhone slipped from the top spot in the region does not mean it can’t be regained in the future. Perhaps Apple will succeed more with its iPhone 16 in China if it’s packed with innovations that set it apart.\n\nEither way, I find expectations for the iPhone in China to still be quite muted and wouldn’t be surprised if the latest, surprisingly decent quarter helps AAPL stock sustain a return to its all-time highs again. Apple may not be “earnings-proof,” but it is worth holding through even the most jittery of earnings seasons. The latest numbers show us why it’s a bad idea to “play” the stock ahead of earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is another blue chip that really surprised to the upside when it reported this earnings season. Unlike Apple, AXP stock was going into its quarterly reveal after a pretty sizeable run that started when shares bottomed in October 2023. The rally is still on, and the latest results are well ahead of expectations. And I think it could have legs until the next round of American Express earnings.\n\nFor the latest (first) quarter, the credit card giant showed great discipline in controlling costs. Additionally, net revenue surged 11% to $15.8 billion, a very impressive showing for the $172 billion behemoth.\n\nOnce again, younger consumers helped drive the results. As the company enhances its focus on bringing on younger people aboard American Express, I’d not be surprised if the firm had a few more upside surprises up its sleeves.\n\nAmerican Express CEO Steve Squeri is a great boss. He’s serious about attracting younger clients, which is key to sustaining its growth. Younger people are spending a lot of money, and many will be enticed to swipe their American Express cards for great perks and points.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nLike American Express, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock had quite a bit of multi-month momentum riding behind it ahead of earnings. Expectations were undoubtedly high, yet Eli Lilly still delivered an impressive showing.\n\nFor the first quarter, Lilly beat the bottom line while raising its full-year guidance for sales and adjusted earnings. The classic beat and raise helped LLY stock rise initially, though not by enough to break out of the $730-790 consolidation channel it had been stuck in since February 2024. Indeed, weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, were the show’s stars, helping Lilly move the needle higher (forgive the pun) on sales.\n\nWith a hefty valuation (59.2 times forward price-to-earnings) and lots of weight-loss drug hype still baked in, it’s unclear what it’ll take to help LLY stock break out past $800 per share. Perhaps more promising results from its phase-three diabetes drug could help investors rally behind the name.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and American Express.

        "title": "5 Stocks Driving Dow's Market-Beating Performance",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average emerged stronger than the other two major indices in the latest market rally, driven by renewed hopes of rate cuts, solid corporate earnings and increased stock buybacks. The blue-chip index gained for seven consecutive days, marking its longest winning streak this year.\r\n\r\nWhile 27 of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Index have performed well over the last seven days, we have highlighted five of them that have been leading the way higher. These are Amgen AMGN, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Boeing BA and The Goldman Sachs Group GS.\r\n\r\nThe outperformance came as the market’s rally broadened out. If this trend lasts, the Dow could continue its upward trajectory this summer.\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of the blue-chip index is finally paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.\r\n\r\nThe blue-chip index also benefited from Apple’s robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The iPhone manufacturer spread strong optimism after lifting its dividend payments and announcing a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\r\n\r\nAnother big mover in the index is Amgen, which surged more than 14% last week on a solid earnings report and encouraging test results of its injectable weight-loss drug MariTide. Bank stocks and small-cap stocks also showed an upward trend in recent sessions, powering the blue-chip index.\r\n\r\nFurther, the index appears unaffected compared with the other two major indices, which cooled down somewhat in the recent sessions following the latest Fed official comments that higher rates will likely stay for some time.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nAmgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation, bone health, nephrology and neuroscience markets. The stock has risen 14.5% so far this month.\r\n\r\nAmgen saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.3%. It has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.\r\n\r\nAmazon is one of the largest e-commerce providers. It jumped nearly 9% over the past seven days and saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nAMZN is expected to see earnings growth of 56.5% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nApple designs, manufactures and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories worldwide. The company offers iPhone, a line of smartphones, Mac, a line of personal computers, iPad, a line of multi-purpose tablets, and wearables, home, and accessories comprising AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products and HomePod. Shares of AAPL are up 8% so far this month.\r\n\r\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending September 2024) with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3.\r\n\r\nBoeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades. The company’s premier jet aircraft along with varied defense products position it as one of the largest defense contractors in the United States. It has a solid estimated earnings growth of 95.9% for this year.\r\n\r\nBoeing has risen 8% so far this month. It has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nGoldman is a leading global financial holding company providing IB, securities, investment management and consumer banking services to a diversified client base. It has risen 6.8% so far this month.\r\n\r\nGoldman saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 71 cents over the past seven days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 60.8%.

        "title": "With Apple entering the fight, the AI chip wars have gone nuclear",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) chip wars have officially kicked into high gear. On Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its latest iPad Pro lineup, complete with the company’s all-new M4 chip. The processor, Apple says, features a 50% faster CPU than the prior generation Pro’s M2 chip, as well as a GPU with four times the performance of its predecessor.\n\nBut Apple focused most on the M4’s neural engine, the portion of the chip dedicated to running AI applications. According to the company, the neural engine in the M4 is the company’s fastest yet, and it's more powerful than any neural processing unit available on today’s AI PCs.\n\nThat might all seem like Apple puffing out its chest at the competition, and it is to a degree. But it also shows we’re entering a new era of PC marketing focused on the promise of generative AI applications running directly on our machines, rather than in the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) is already pushing the category of AI PCs along with Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Nvidia (NVDA), and with Apple entering the fray, the battle over which company is the new AI champ has officially begun.\n\nThe AI wars\n\nThe AI PC, or in the case of Apple AI iPad or AI Mac, is meant to be able to run smaller versions of the kinds of large language models that power apps like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Google’s Gemini. In fact, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already runs a version of its Gemini model called Gemini Nano on its Pixel smartphones. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nAI PCs are, generally, PCs that include neural processing units (NPUs), or in Apple’s case, a neural engine. These are essentially portions of a chip dedicated to powering AI applications. Intel’s Core Ultra chips, which it debuted in December, feature their own NPUs, while AMD has been showing off chips with its XDNA AI engine since May 2023. Qualcomm, for its part, has also joined the fight with its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips.\n\nAll of these chips should end up in Windows PCs on store shelves by the end of the year. Microsoft is already banking on AI PCs being a runaway success, going so far as to introduce a Windows keyboard button dedicated to its AI-powered Copilot software. It’s the first new keyboard button in nearly 30 years.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has been building its neural engine into its chips since it launched its A11 processor in the iPhone X in 2017. The company has regularly touted its neural engine’s capabilities throughout the years, but the debut of the M4 chip marked the first time Apple started throwing out key performance metrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring its press event unveiling the M4, Apple was sure to point out that it not only has been outfitting its chips with neural processing engines for years but that the M4 is capable of running 38 trillion operations per second (TOPS). TOPS is more or less a measurement of how well a chip can handle AI tasks.\n\nQualcomm, for its part, says that its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips offer 45 TOPS of performance. And according to CNET, Intel and AMD’s chips top out at 34 and 38 TOPS, respectively. Qualcomm on Wednesday announced its latest chips designed to run on Windows laptops, taking aim at Intel and Nvidia. (Image: Qualcomm) (Qualcomm)\n\nYou can’t mention AI performance without talking about Nvidia, but it’s almost unfair to compare its chips to the competition. That’s because Nvidia’s graphics chips are dedicated to graphics processing and can be programmed to run AI apps. But because they’re not multipurpose chips like those from Apple, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm, they’re far more capable. In fact, Nvidia claims its laptop chips offer 20x to 60x the performance of competing neural processing units.\n\nThe point is, there’s a new stat for these tech companies to battle over, and you can be sure they’ll do just that. The fact that Apple had already come out swinging with its own measurement is proof enough of that.\n\nTOPS and you\n\nWhat does that mean for the average consumer? Not all that much just yet. Generative AI apps running on PCs and Macs and iPads are still few and far between. So far, there are programs that help you manipulate photos and videos or track your eye movement in video chat apps.\n\nBut there’s still no killer app that would get me to go running out the door to pick up an AI PC. That could all change in the coming weeks, though. That’s because Microsoft and Apple are set to kick off their annual developers conferences, where they’re expected to debut a slew of AI apps and services, and at least some of those should run on their respective devices.\n\nHow much they manage to entice consumers to pony up for AI PCs and the like, however, will depend on whether they’re truly useful or not.

It shows a hydraulic press crushing instruments like a piano and a guitar, as well as media devices like a television and cameras.\n\nThe short ad shows the press completely destroying the objects and lifts to show a single device: the new, slim iPad Pro.\n\n\"Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world,\" Apple's Marketing Communications VP Tor Myhren said in a statement to Ad Age. \"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.\"\n\nAPPLE ANNOUNCES NEW IPAD PRO, AIR TABLETS Apple has apologized after a new iPad Pro ad caused a stir on social media.\n\nThe ad faced overwhelmingly negative attention, with many people responding that it was offensive or disrespectful.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nFOX Business reached out to Apple but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nAPPLE SALES FALL LESS THAN EXPECTED, BEATING WALL STREET ESTIMATES\n\nIt was first shared on Tuesday by Apple CEO Tim Cook in a post on X, calling it \"the most advanced display we’ve ever produced.\"\n\n\"Meet the new iPad Pro: the thinnest product we’ve ever created, the most advanced display we’ve ever produced, with the incredible power of the M4 chip. Just imagine all the things it’ll be used to create,\" Cook wrote.\n\nSeveral people commented critically — and the ad has since been widely shared and has faced similar knocks.\n\n\"I’m not sure ‘wanton destruction of all the good and beautiful things is this world’ was really the vibe you were trying for,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"I can't relate to this video at all. It lacks any respect for creative equipment and mocks the creators,\" another added. Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke out about the viral ad.\n\n\"Crushing symbols of human creativity and cultural achievements to appeal to pro creators, nice,\" yet another user wrote.\n\nOne user wrote: \"I felt sad when I saw creative tools such as musical instruments and cameras being destroyed. I don't think the creators will like this video.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAnd, \"The symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools is an interesting choice,\" another said. A different response read: \"You destroyed all the creative tools and effort of humans.  Worst.  Commercial.  Ever.\" The new iPad Pro is the first Apple device with the M4 chip. The larger version with a 13-inch display is the thinnest Apple device to date, with a thickness of 5.1 millimeters.\n\nAnother echoed: \"It is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement. When I see this result, I'm ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ad remains posted on Cook’s account and Apple’s YouTube account. Other ads for the new device showcase its processor and graphic capabilities.\n\nThe iPad Pro starts at $999. It will be available on May 15.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple forced to apologize after new iPad Pro ad sparks controversy online: 'We missed the mark. We’re sorry'\n\nView comments",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Biggest Publicly Traded AI Companies in the World.\n\n\"NVIDIA Has to Keep Working\"\n\nOn May 8, Stuart Kaiser, Citi's Head of Equity Trading Strategy, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the role of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in shaping the market for artificial intelligence. Kaiser suggests that the company's earnings report may be the biggest event to look forward to right now, especially for equity holders, according to the S&P 500 index. He also highlighted that if the 10-year rate was pinned at 4.75%, equities would not be largely impacted if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) misses earnings on May 22nd. The interviewer then directs the conversation to discuss the volatility of the stock. The stock went down to $735 and $740 a couple of weeks ago, to which Kaiser emphasized how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) poses a macro risk to the market, keeping in mind that it is priced for a significant swing of 10%. Companies like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) went down double digitals, and big tech stocks, now stabilized, also have been down in correlation. To put NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) position into perspective, the company's earnings report and the way big and small tech companies react to it are extremely crucial to the AI space at the moment.\n\nThe interviewer then questions how megacap tech stocks upheld their leadership position in the market. The interviewer highlights that the NASDAQ 100 hit a high in July last year and mid-January this year, and has been sideways since, relative to the S&P 500 index.

        "title": "Apple forced into rare apology for ‘tone-deaf’ iPad advert: ‘We missed the mark with this video’",
        "content": "Apple has been behind some of the most iconic adverts to hit screens over the past couple of decades—but its latest offering was blasted as \"distasteful\" by fans, leaving the company's VP of marketing picking up the pieces.\n\nApple’s Tor Myhren said the Big Tech giant had \"missed the mark\" with the video released this week, and apologized to customers who called out the brand for its \"tone-deaf\" marketing.\n\nSpeaking to Ad Age this week, Myhren said: “Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it’s incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world.\n\n\"Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”\n\nIt came after Apple CEO Tim Cook posted a tease for the new iPad Pro on X.\n\nThe advert shows various creative tools standing on a platform: musical instruments like a guitar, piano and trumpet, as well as artistic products like paint, a bust and an artist mannequin.\n\nElsewhere other creative outlets are shown: a pile of books, pairs of binoculars, a globe, a turntable.\n\nAll of which are promptly crushed by a hydraulic press. The advert then shows the press pad lifting up, revealing an iPad in the place of the aforementioned products.\n\n\"Just imagine all the thing it'll be used to create,\" Cook—who was compensated $49 million for his work in 2023—wrote on the post.\n\nCustomers on X—some of whom were the very creatives Cook may have been trying to catch the eye of—were infuriated by the advert.\n\n\"The symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools is an interesting choice,\" wrote one user.\n\n\"You destroyed all the creative tools and effort of humans,\" wrote another. \"Worst. Commercial. Ever.\"\n\nAnd Apple—perhaps more accustomed to hearing excitement and hype about its new products—was forced to listen.\n\nPlans to run the advert on TV have now been scrapped, though the video titled 'Crush!' is still on Cook's profile and on Apple's YouTube account.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc&ab_channel=Apple\n\nAd blunders\n\nApple isn't the first organization to fumble its advertising for creatives.\n\nIn 2020, a government-backed advert in the UK was labeled \"crass\" even by politicians in Whitechapel, as it suggested that a ballet dancer should retrain as an IT worker.\n\nThe advert, emblazoned with the symbols HM Government and the CyberFirst program, shows a photograph of a young woman in a tutu tying a pair of pointe shoes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe caption reads: \"Fatima's next job could be in cyber (she just doesn't know it yet.)\"\n\nAt the time culture secretary Oliver Dowden distanced himself from the campaign, writing on X: \"To those tweeting re #Fatima. This is not something from @DCMS [The Department for Culture, Media and Sport] & I agree it was crass.\"\n\nFor Apple to make a similar misstep is unusual for the brand, beloved for its sleek aesthetics, eye-catching adverts and original retail offering.\n\nAnd the departure had many watchers reflecting on where Apple began and where it is now.\n\nAmong the responses to Cook's X post was a reply from Paul Graham, who founded Silicon Valley VC Y-Combinator.\n\nAlthough the entrepreneur and computer scientist previously said he's never met Apple founder Steve Jobs, he wrote to Cook: \"Steve wouldn't have shipped that ad. It would have pained him too much to watch.\"\n\nSteve wouldn't have shipped that ad. It would have pained him too much to watch.\n\n— Paul Graham (@paulg) May 8, 2024\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Best Auto Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "The auto sector is entering an exciting and more lucrative era. That’s because automakers are starting to charge subscription fees for high-tech services. I believe that these companies will soon also start offering to track the well-being of various components within vehicles in exchange for fees. Which may transform them into the one of the best auto stocks investors want to buy. Of course, for the owners of electric vehicles, keeping informed about the welfare and needs of their EV’s batteries is extremely important. As a result, I’m sure that many owners will be willing to pay to stay on top of those matters.\n\nImportantly, most consumers seem willing to pay monthly fees for services within their vehicles. But they often like to try out these services first. In July 2023, S&P polled roughly 4,500 consumers who had a free trial or a subscription for services within their vehicles. More than 80% of the respondents said they would consider purchasing subscription-based services in the future. For investors who want to profit from this trend, here are the three best auto stocks to buy.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nModern electric vehicles are much more computerized than their gas-powered counterparts. Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) CEO Peter Rawlinson explained in 2021 that computing has become central to vehicles, especially EVs. As a result, it’s much easier to offer software-based services through EVs than gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, automakers that sell many EVs will be much better positioned to offer software subscriptions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmong the veteran automakers, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the best positioned firms to become a top seller of EVs. Sales of the Cadillac Lyriq luxury SUV jumped 500% last quarter year-over-year to 5,800. The Chevrolet Bolt was a top-selling EV in the U.S before it was taken off the market. However, GM is slated to release a retooled version of the Bolt next year. Moreover, the automaker has begun selling electric versions of many of its most popular trucks and SUVs. I believe that these will become best sellers in the longer term. Boding well for the future, GM expects its North American EV business to enter the black in the second half of this year.\n\nFinally, GM reported very strong first-quarter results, has a very low valuation, and is returning a great deal of cash to its shareholders.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHow can anyone not love a company that’s an integral partner of both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt appears that EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) could be on the verge of achieving that huge milestone. As of last October, the start-up had provided Amazon with 10,000 of the delivery vans that the e-commerce giant has ordered. And tech website DigiTimes recently reported that Apple is considering forming a partnership with Rivian.\n\nSuch an alliance would certainly make sense for Apple. Obviously, the software behemoth is interested in selling products via EVs. And Rivian is one of the top American EV-oriented firms.\n\nMeanwhile, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe did not deny that the automaker could partner with Apple. He even noted that his company has a history of partnerships. Given these points, I think there’s a very high chance of the two firms forming an alliance. Such a deal should prove to be very lucrative for Rivian.\n\nVinFast (VFS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of Vietnamese car manufacturer VinFast (VFS) on screen in front of business web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nVinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) is a Vietnam-based EV startup that’s growing very rapidly and has a semi-secret weapon. Last quarter the company’s sales soared 270% YOY to $302.65 million. Meanwhile, its EV deliveries jumped 444% YOY to 9,689.\n\nThe automaker’s semi-secret weapon is its alliance with Israeli EV battery maker StoreDot. The company’s batteries will be utilized by VinFast’s commercially available vehicles starting next year.\n\nAnother EV maker, Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY), recently reported that a test they conducted showed that StorDot’s battery can add 200 miles worth of charge in just 10 minutes.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN and AMZN.The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The Smartest Dividend Stocks to Buy With Under $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Big technology companies have always been known for generating price appreciation for investors, but the tide is slowly changing. Personal electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has paid dividends since 2012. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) recently joined the dividend ranks.\n\nMany dividend investors look for cash flow first and foremost. Did you know these three companies have combined for an astounding $220 billion in cash flow over the past year alone? No group of businesses has generated as much cash flow in humanity's history as these technology giants.\n\nNow, they've turned on the spigot, funneling some of those profits to shareholder profits.\n\nHere's the pitch for why each company is among the smartest dividend stocks you can buy for under $1,000.\n\n1. Apple is still among the world's best businesses\n\nThings haven't been perfect for Apple in recent years. The company's growth has stagnated, a sign that Apple has gotten so big that its flagship iPhone product can no longer move the needle. But don't get it mixed up; Apple is still a behemoth that earns more in cash flow than all but a few companies worldwide do in sales. It's still Warren Buffett's top holding, even if the Oracle of Omaha sold some of his stock via Berkshire Hathaway. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nLong-term investors should focus on some very important facts. First, Apple can return more cash to shareholders than any company. It recently unveiled the largest share repurchase program in U.S. history, a $110 billion buyback that will dent the company's share count (and boost earnings per share). Additionally, the dividend has a multidecade runway for growth. The dividend payout ratio is just 15% of cash flow. Apple has all the makings of a future Dividend King, especially as those massive buybacks show how quickly the payout ratio rises as the dividend grows.\n\nMost importantly, Apple is one big product away from newfound growth. More than two billion people have active iOS devices worldwide, and there are growing middle classes worldwide, including in India, where the company is shifting parts of its production. That's a massive distribution network for new products. Plus, Apple still hasn't swung hard at artificial intelligence (AI), so watch out. Apple's best growth is probably behind it, but earnings per share could still have plenty of juice to squeeze.\n\n2. Alphabet is the newest member of the big-tech dividend club\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, recently unveiled its first dividend during its first-quarter earnings. The quarterly payout will add up to $0.80 annually for a starting 0.5% yield. That's obviously not much, but Alphabet is one of the largest cash cows on Earth. Rest assured, that dividend will grow over the decades to come. Think of buying shares today as getting in on the dividend \"ground floor.\" It's only going up from here. If that wasn't enough, Alphabet casually tacked another $70 billion to its ongoing share repurchase program.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet makes most of its money by advertising on Google and YouTube, and while advertising can be sensitive to the economy, Alphabet hasn't suffered a dramatic downturn in its business: GOOGL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nGoogle and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide by a wide margin. Alphabet's advertising revenue is still growing at a double-digit rate, which signals significant cash flow growth still ahead. That should be music to long-term investors' ears. The dividend starts from a minuscule size, just 15% of annual cash flow, so look for a ton of growth over the coming years. Now is a great time to buy and watch your passive income grow.\n\n3. Meta has the makings of a dividend powerhouse\n\nWall Street can be short-sighted. Perhaps that's why Meta's stock has retreated from its highs after CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear in Q1 earnings that the company will continue investing heavily in artificial intelligence. But this is an opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up this future dividend superstar at a lower price. Meta's lucrative advertising business involves selling ads on its social media apps: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and (eventually) Threads.\n\nRemarkably, Meta is converting 35% of its revenue to free cash flow despite spending tens of billions of dollars in capital expenditures. Cut those in half, and Meta would convert a staggering 44% of sales to cash. Keep that in mind for the future when capital expenditures eventually recede. META Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nMeta is also growing swiftly; revenue grew 27% year over year in Q1. The company potentially has years of double-digit growth ahead and decades of double-digit dividend increases. Don't let the stock's meager 0.1% yield turn you away. The payout ratio is only about 10% of free cash flow and even less of operating cash flow. Meta is a true compounder -- a business that is growing earnings and the cash it returns to shareholders at a double-digit rate, a gem long-term investors should buy and hold indefinitely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "TSMC saw its April revenue jump nearly 60% percent on-year. (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nTSMC (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s April revenue jumped nearly 60% percent on-year, as the firm rides a wave of sustained demand for the advanced semiconductors used in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware.\n\nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker said consolidated revenues for April were approximately TWD236.02bn (£5.7bn/$7.2bn), an increase of 59.6% from April 2023. This compares with a 34.3% on-year jump in March 2024.\n\nThe company is Nvidia’s (NVDA) sole manufacturer for the most advanced training chips. TSMC also fabricates semiconductors for Apple (AAPL).\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks climb as UK economy escapes recession\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast month, TSMC announced its newest semiconductor process, advanced packaging, and other technologies for powering the next generation of AI innovations.\n\n\"We are entering an AI-empowered world, where artificial intelligence not only runs in data centres, but PCs, mobile devices, automobiles and even the internet of things,\" said CEO C.C. Wei.\n\nNovavax (NVAX)\n\nShares in Novavax were higher in pre-market trading as the pharmaceutical said it has signed a $1.2bn (£957m) deal with French drugmaker Sanofi (SAN.PA) to co-commercialise the company’s COVID vaccine starting next year.\n\nNovavax will receive $500m in upfront payments as well as $700m in development, regulatory and launch milestones, according to a statement.\n\nThat total is roughly double Novavax’s current market cap of $627m.\n\nSanofi is also taking a minority equity stake of about 5% in Novavax. Novavax will benefit from a double-digit percentage of royalties from the sales of its Covid jab as well as any combined shot using its technology.\n\nNovavax has had some turbulent times. Its market value boomed to more than $40bn at the height of the pandemic, propelled by investor excitement over its COVID shot. But it has since fallen by almost 99%.\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nShares in the miner were higher amid reports that rival Rio Tinto (RIO.L) had considered an offer for British miner Anglo American, which is now BHP’s (BHP.L) £31bn takeover target.\n\nStory continues\n\nRio “management had not ruled out making a play for part or all of the mining group and continued to study the day-to-day situation\", the Australian Financial Review reported.\n\nAnglo has turned down BHP’s proposal, saying it was opportunistic and significantly undervalued the British company. Under the UK’s takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer.\n\nRead more: Bank of England holds interest rates but hints at summer cut\n\n“Shares in Anglo American are up on a report that Rio Tinto also considered a bid following BHP’s rejected offer. M&A speculation is helping to keep Anglo shares supported at the moment,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.\n\nBHP and Rio have a close working relationship at Escondida and Resolution Copper. One option for Rio is to informally assist BHP’s bid for Anglo by acquiring the assets that BHP does not want, such as Anglo’s diamond business, AFR wrote.\n\nGlencore is also studying options for a possible approach for Anglo, Reuters reported earlier in the month, a move that could spark a bidding war.\n\nIAG (IAG.L)\n\nThe owner of airlines British Airways and Aer Lingus has said its earnings have soared in recent months thanks to higher sales and lower fuel costs.\n\nInternational Airlines Group (IAG) reported an operating profit for the first three months of the year of €68m (£58.5m), up from the €9m (£7.7m) reported this time last year.\n\nTotal revenues also jumped to €6.4bn (£5.5bn), up from €5.9bn (£5.1bn) last year, while fuel costs were about 5% lower than the previous year, due to lower average prices and more efficient aircraft deliveries.\n\nIAG said the improved profits and sales had been driven by stronger demand across its airlines, which also include Iberia and Vueling.\n\nIt also highlighted that it was continuing to see a rebound in leisure travel.\n\nWatch: Market strategist sees dollar dip lifting non-US stocks\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s administration is poised to unveil a sweeping decision on China tariffs as soon as next week, one that’s expected to target key strategic sectors with new levies while rejecting the kind of across-the-board hikes sought by Donald Trump, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings ‘Seriously Underwater’ Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Marjorie Taylor Greene Finally Got What She Deserved: Defeat\n\nThe decision is the culmination of a review of so-called Section 301 tariffs first imposed under Trump. The administration is set to impose new, targeted tariffs on some key sectors including electric vehicles, batteries and solar equipment. The full announcement is expected to also largely maintain existing levies. An announcement is scheduled for Tuesday, two of the people said.\n\nThe full details aren’t clear, and the White House declined comment.\n\nWhile a decision could be delayed, it nonetheless presents one of Biden’s biggest moves in the economic race with China. It builds on a call last month to hike tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, and the formal launch of a fresh probe into Chinese shipbuilding.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "More Money, More Streams: Netflix, Disney+, AppleTV+ And Hulu See Higher Usage Among Wealthier Americans\n\nDespite feeling overwhelmed by the growing number of streaming platforms, Americans continue to subscribe, and a new survey reveals the most popular choices among middle-income levels compared to others.\n\nWhat Happened: Even as consumer face financial pressure to reduce spending on streaming subscriptions or switch to more affordable, ad-supported plans, leading streaming companies like Netflix and Disney continue to experience subscriber growth.\n\nThe leading streaming companies are thriving, with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) gaining 9.33 million paid net new subscribers in the first quarter to bring the company to a total of 269.60 million. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) added 6.3 million Disney+ Core subscribers in the second quarter to bring the company to a total of 117.6 million.\n\nOther streaming companies are also seeing growth of their subscribers and operating income for their direct-to-consumer segments.\n\nA survey from Morning Consult shows that Netflix was the streaming company most likely to be used across three income levels of <$50,000, $50,000 to $99,999, and >$100,000.\n\nNetflix was selected by 71% of the respondents in the $50,000 to $99,999 income level as a platform that they use, compared to 77% of the higher income earners and 62% of the low-income earners.\n\nHulu ranked second for middle income Americans at 53%. The platform is majority owned by Disney, which also had the third ranked streaming platform with Disney+ used by 47% of middle-income earners.\n\nPeacock ranked fourth at 45% usage by middle-income earners. The streaming platform from Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) almost saw more middle-income American usage than high-income earners (46%).\n\nRoku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) was selected by 43% of middle-income earners, which was higher than the 40% of high-income earners who said they use the platform. Low-income earners had the highest percentage for the streaming platform at 47%.\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) was selected by 42% of middle-income earners, beating out rival music streaming platform Pandora (35%), which is owned by Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI).\n\nAppleTV+ from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranked lower at 26% for middle-income earners and had wide gaps between low-income earners (18%) and high-income earners (37%).\n\nRelated Link: Disney Direct-To-Consumer Segment Profits In Q2, ‘Operating Income Modestly Ahead’ Of Analyst Expectations\n\nWhy It's Important: The survey shows that people are more likely to have more streaming platforms if they earn more, which shouldn't be a surprise.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway from the survey is the gaps for several platforms across income levels. For instance, Netflix shows a 15 percentage point difference in usage between low and high-income earners.\n\nHulu’s gap is narrower, at seven percentage points. Peacock displays the smallest discrepancy, with only a four percentage point gap and consistent usage across all income groups.\n\nRoku was also a surprise in the survey, as the platform is more likely to be used with lower income earners than with higher income earners.\n\nAppleTV+ had one of the widest gaps, with a 19-point gap from low-income to high-income earners. This could suggest that when it comes to picking a streaming platform, lower-income consumers would rather spend their money on other platforms. This could be perhaps due to Apple having a smaller content library and being one of the newer streaming platforms.\n\nTo help offset concerns of too many platforms and prices, several media companies are teaming up to offer bundles of streaming platforms. Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is teaming up with Disney to offer a bundle of Max, Hulu and Disney+.\n\nRead Next: EXCLUSIVE: Streaming Platform Winner Picked By Benzinga Readers: Did Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video Or Max Take Top Honors?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article More Money, More Streams: Netflix, Disney+, AppleTV+ And Hulu See Higher Usage Among Wealthier Americans originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Apple\n\nHugh Grant has accused Apple of “the destruction of the human experience” amid a backlash after the tech giant crushed musical instruments and art in an iPad advert.\n\nThe minute-long advert for the tech giant’s new iPad Pro shows pianos, guitars and sculptures being squashed by an industrial press, in a reference to the thinness of the new models and the array of tasks artists can supposedly accomplish with the device.\n\nHowever, when Apple chief Tim Cook posted the ad on the social network X, it was besieged by thousands of negative responses. Mr Grant wrote: “The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple apologised for the advert late on Thursday, saying it had “missed the mark”. Hugh Grant added that \"I could go on\" in his criticism of the iPad Pro advert - REUTERS/Maja Smiejkowska\n\nAuthors, designers, artists and musicians were among those who criticised the Silicon Valley company.\n\nCritics contrasted the new advert to Apple’s celebrated 1984 advert based on the George Orwell book of the same name, in which the company presented itself as a rebellious antidote to a status quo represented by its then-rival IBM.\n\nOne user, James Clark, said that the advert from 40 years ago represented a “monochrome, conformist, industrial world exploded by colourful, vibrant human”, while the new advert represented humanity being crushed.\n\nChristopher Slevin, the creative director of marketing agency Inkling Culture, wrote on LinkedIn: “Apple’s new iPad spot is essentially them turning into the thing they said they were out to destroy in the 1984 ad.”\n\nPaul Graham, the founder of the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, said that Mr Cook’s predecessor, Steve Jobs, “wouldn’t have shipped that ad. It would have pained him too much to watch.”\n\nSeveral users reversed the video so it played backwards, showing instruments, books, video games consoles and artwork rebounding to life, generating positive responses.\n\nThe video comes at a sensitive time for creative professionals’ relationship with the tech industry. Record labels and authors have sued tech companies for using their output to train artificial intelligence systems, which they say is a copyright violation.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has not released an AI chatbot like ChatGPT, but is expected to feature so-called generative AI features in the next version of its iPhone software.\n\nThe new advert was intended to promote the latest iPad Pro the company unveiled on Monday, at a time when the company is seeking to boost flagging sales. iPad revenues fell by 17pc in the most recent quarter.\n\nApple told AdAge: “Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves ... We missed the mark with this video, and we’re sorry.”",

        "title": "Google Stares Down Largest Tech Antitrust Ruling In 2 Decades — Is AT&amp;T-Style Breakup Next?",
        "content": "Closing arguments for the largest antitrust trial to date against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also known as Google, wrapped up last week.\n\nNow, it's up to Judge Amit Mehta to decide on a ruling that could change the fate of the company and others in the big tech space.\n\nMehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is expected to come up with a decision before the end of the year.\n\nThe case was put forth by the Justice Department in 2020, together with attorneys general from 11 states, who are arguing that Google has engaged in anti-competitive practices in order to maintain its dominance in the internet search space.\n\nSpecifically, they're looking at the billions of dollars Google pays monthly to other tech companies in order to secure its place as the default search engine in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, LG, Motorola owned by Lenovo Group Ltd (OTC:LNVGY) and other devices as well as in browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Opera. The plaintiffs argue that this practice prevents other companies from succeeding with their own search engine products, giving Google disproportionate market share in the search engine space.\n\nLast week, court documents revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be the default search engine on Safari, the web browser used on iPhone, iPad and Mac devices. In 2021, the figure amounted to $26.3 billion when including other browsers like Firefox.\n\nGoogle is estimated to account for about 90% of all internet searches, widely outpacing competitors like Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, a search engine that is privately owned and focused on user privacy.\n\nThe final arguments from Google's attorneys as well as DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist followed a 10-week trial between September and November 2023.\n\nRead also: Google Fights Fortnite Maker’s Play Store Changes Amid Antitrust Battle: What’s at Stake?\n\nThe case, however, was three years in the making for the Justice Department. The central argument of the lawsuit is that Google’s control of today’s internet is extensive enough to be considered a monopoly, and that it violated antitrust laws by paying competitor firms, cell phone manufacturers, and wireless internet providers to maintain its position as the default search engine.\n\nThe company then benefitted from the extra traffic via its ad business.\n\nFor its part, Google has argued that its market dominance is merely a result of the superior quality of its products in a fair competition game. While the company has admitted to paying partners and competitors to give its search engine a prime position, it has argued (both in an open letter from September 2023 and in the trial) that web browser developers choose to showcase Google by their own will.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also argued that competitors like Yahoo or Bing also pay browser developers to receive a preferential position in their software and that it's very easy for users to change the default search engine on any device.\n\nThe importance of the trial is hard to overstate. This case marks the first time the Federal Government has brought a big technology company to court on antitrust charges in over two decades, since a U.S. judge ruled that Microsoft had violated the nation’s antitrust laws in 2000, in a lawsuit initiated by the Justice Department and 19 states in 1998.\n\nThe consequences of the decision could also ripple across several other antitrust lawsuits currently shaking up Big Tech companies, including an ongoing antitrust probe by the Federal Trade Commission into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well as a probe by the same agency into Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), parent company of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram.\n\nGoogle is also under fire in Europe, where the EU’s Court of Justice is fining it $2.6 billion over antitrust penalties.\n\nWhat's At Stake For Google?\n\nIn a press release, the Justice Department has compared this lawsuit with other landmark antitrust actions including Microsoft in 1998 and AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) 1974 trial which eventually broke the Bell system into several companies nationwide in 1982.\n\nBy the end of last week's arguments, Mehta said he has not arrived at a decision yet. According to CNN, the judge proposed that in order to be able to compete with Google's dominant position, a hypothetical competitor would need to invest billions, not just in developing the complex search tool itself, but also in competing with Google on its billion-dollar exclusivity contracts with web browser developers and device manufacturers.\n\n\"I can't conceive of a world in which some other competitor, particularly a new competitor, could do that. Microsoft couldn't do it,\" Mehta said.\n\nIf Mehta rules in favor of the Justice Department, the trial would move to a second stage, wherein the court would determine which penalties Google should face. In these separate proceedings, plaintiffs and the company would present different ways in which Google should respond in order to relinquish some of its alleged monopolistic power.\n\nPossible avenues would be to break up the company into several units, including a separate one for the Android operating system, which is currently owned by Google, according to Bloomberg. Another possible penalty would be forcing Google to disclose its search data to competitors in order to level the playing field, or forcing the company to give up its exclusivity agreements with other companies.\n\nBill Baer, a former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division told the New York Times that it's unlikely that DOJ. will seek some sort of breakup for the company.\n\n\"It's more likely there will be some sort of restrictions on Google's behavior going forward,\" he said.\n\nNow read: Has Chrome Been Tracking You During ‘Incognito’ Mode?

        "title": "Apple ad obliterates the tools of human creativity with a hydraulic press to hype its ‘thinnest product yet.’ Offended consumers flipped it to make a less ‘horrific corporate nightmare’",
        "content": "Apple tried tapping into TikTok users’ unique fascination with watching things get crushed–so satisfying–as an advertisement strategy for its newest iPad Pro.\n\nViewers of the ad, though have a different opinion: Vanquishing the hand-held tools of art and creativity, like musical instruments, paints and styluses as well as antique arcade games and cameras with a hydraulic press, and insisting its thinnest iPad ever could weather such destruction, is a story of “anti-humanity destruction.” It is not, as Apple appears to have intended, a breakthrough that will eliminate the need for mixed mediums. In a reversal, artists offended by the ad noticed that playing the video backward would show the creative tools escaping the destruction of the hydraulic press, and declared the new series of images a “less heartbreaking” symbol of the triumph of art over technology.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook posted the ad to X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday, writing “Meet the new iPad Pro, the thinnest product we’ve ever created,” adding, “just imagine all the things it’ll be used to create.” That message seemed to strike a different chord with viewers and longtime customers of the tech giant, many of whom criticized how “the video shows a thousand beautiful things being destroyed,” and the “symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools” in the ad.\n\nThe symbolism of indiscriminately crushing beautiful creative tools is an interesting choice.\n\n— Kiaran Ritchie (@kiaran_ritchie) May 7, 2024\n\nTo be sure, the ad has spurred a lot of rage. “This ad effectively convinced me I need less technology in my life,” one user posted on X. Another user, Hiroki Akiyama, who works as the chief technology officer at search platform for customer support Helpfeel, wrote “it is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement,” adding that “when I see this result, I’m ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years.”\n\nThis ad effectively convinced me I need less technology in my life.\n\n— 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗠𝗲 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 (@txsalth2o) May 8, 2024\n\nIt is a heartbreaking, uncomfortable, and egotistic advertisement. When I see this result, I'm ashamed to buy Apple products since nineteen years.\n\n— Hiroki Akiyama (@akiroom) May 7, 2024\n\nThe ad has especially angered a lot of Japanese creatives, according to a thread of responses to Cook’s post of the ad on X. One user wrote he felt sad seeing creative tools being destroyed, stating “I don’t think the creators will like this video. Is it my Japanese sensibility that makes me feel this way?”\n\nStory continues\n\nMany other Japanese creators chimed in with their discontent about the ad’s insensitivity, as one user wrote: “In Japan, one of the meaningful markets for your company, I believe that many sensitive people were hurt by the advertising expression. I am a long time fan of the iPad Pro, but this is too sad [an] image.” Another wrote, “many craftsmen value their tools,” and the video, which presents tools of many creative industries all pulverized together, “will only disgust them.”\n\nEverybody hated That Apple Ad but the Japanese REALLY hated it. I’ve never seen so many upset Japanese ppl commenting on a single thread: pic.twitter.com/OyAOl37ilr\n\n— Angelica 🌐⚛️🇹🇼 (@AngelicaOung) May 8, 2024\n\nIt’s a sentiment deeply rooted in a growing fear of how advanced technology and AI will impact, or even hijack the market for creatives, especially those who depend on the success of their creativity to earn a living.\n\nMany professional artists have spoken up about the harms they’ve experienced due to the proliferation of AI–or more importantly, the lack of regulation over the technology. Those harms include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement, according to a study that measured the impact of AI art on artists.\n\nAI, which uses machine learning-based image generators with an ability to “output consistently higher quality images,” has been capturing the nation’s attention for the last several years, with its ability to easily recreate photos into pretty much anything. Your selfie can easily be transformed into an air-brushed goddess version of you, or recreated in the painting style of Van Gogh. In fact, generative AI art is an estimated $48 billion industry, the study found.\n\nIt’s important to note for AI to transform you, it first needs to input material into its learning model, and such material is often made by humans. As it turns out, that’s one of the very areas artists are concerned about.\n\nWhile artists hone their craft over years of practice, often spending time and money on schooling, supplies, books, and tutorials, the study found, AI companies are “using their works without compensation while raising billions from venture capitalists to compete with them in the same market.” The inherent inequality of this relationship, the study states, means that power over how generative AI operates could end up centralized in the hands of a few corporations in Western nations, “while disenfranchising artists around the world.”\n\nAccording to 2022 data from the U.S Census Bureau, about 2.6 million Americans are employed as artists, which the federal government defines by a handful of occupations, including architects, fine artists, animators, designers, actors, dancers, photographers, and others. The unemployment rate for artists in 2022 was 3.9%, up from 3.7% in 2019–and is relatively higher than other professional workers who generally require college training, which has an unemployment rate of about 2%.\n\nTo be sure, these concerns are just some of the reasons people might not be too quick to enjoy an advertisement that insists the nuances of historic human creativity can be accomplished on Apple’s latest iPad.\n\nSome particularly offended viewers of the ad have edited the video to play in reverse, which depicts the creative tools essentially being freed from the destructive grasp of the hydraulic press. Users on X wrote that reversing the ad makes it “less of a horrific corporate nightmare,” and many herald that version as an improvement over the original.\r\nOn X, one user wrote, “honestly, they should just say ‘whoops’ and release a new ad which is the exact same video played backwards.”\n\nHonestly, they should just say \"whoops\" and release a new ad which is the exact same video played backwards.\n\n— nagolinc (@nagolinc) May 8, 2024\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Technology crushing human creativity? Apple's new iPad ad has struck a nerve online",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A newly released ad promoting Apple's new iPad Pro has struck quite a nerve online.\n\nThe ad, which was released by the tech giant Tuesday, shows a hydraulic press crushing just about every creative instrument artists and consumers have used over the years — from a piano and record player, to piles of paint, books, cameras and relics of arcade games. Resulting from the destruction? A pristine new iPad Pro.\n\n“The most powerful iPad ever is also the thinnest,” a narrator says at the end of the commercial.\n\nApple's intention seems straightforward: Look at all the things this new product can do. But critics have called it tone-deaf — with several marketing experts noting the campaign's execution missed the mark.\n\n“I had a really disturbing reaction to the ad,” said Americus Reed II, professor of marketing at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “I understood conceptually what they were trying to do, but ... I think the way it came across is, here is technology crushing the life of that nostalgic sort of joy (from former times).”\n\nThe ad also arrives during a time many feel uncertain or fearful about seeing their work or everyday routines “replaced” by technological advances — particularly amid the rapid commercialization of generative artificial intelligence. And watching beloved items get smashed into oblivion doesn't help curb those fears, Reed and others note.\n\nSeveral celebrities were also among the voices critical of Apple’s “Crush!” commercial on social media this week.\n\n“The destruction of the human experience. Courtesy of Silicon Valley,” actor Hugh Grant wrote on the social media platform X, in a repost of Apple CEO Tim Cook's sharing of the ad.\n\nSome found the ad to be a telling metaphor of the industry today — particularly concerns about big tech negatively impacting creatives. Filmmaker Justine Bateman wrote on X that the commercial “crushes the arts.\"\n\nExperts added that the commercial marked a notable difference to marketing seen from Apple in the past — which has often taken more positive or uplifting approaches.\n\n“My initial thought was that Apple has become exactly what it never wanted to be,” Vann Graves, executive director of the Virginia Commonwealth University's Brandcenter, said.\n\nGraves pointed to Apple’s famous 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh computer, which he said focused more on uplifting creativity and thinking outside of the box as a unique individual. In contrast, Graves added, “this (new iPad) commercial says, ‘No, we’re going to take all the creativity in the world and use a hydraulic press to push it down into one device that everyone uses.’\"\n\nStory continues\n\nApple did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company unveiled its latest generation of iPad Pros and Airs earlier this week in a showcase that lauded new features for both lines. The Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display.\n\nApple is trying to juice demand for iPads after its sales of the tablets plunged 17% from last year during the January-March period. After its 2010 debut helped redefine the tablet market, the iPad has become a minor contributor to Apple’s success. It currently accounts for just 6% of the company’s sales.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple to Power AI Tools With In-House Server Chips This Year",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will deliver some of its upcoming artificial intelligence features this year via data centers equipped with its own in-house processors, part of a sweeping effort to infuse its devices with AI capabilities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox Is Planning More Cuts After Studio Closings ‘Seriously Underwater’ Home Mortgages Tick Up Across the US Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Marjorie Taylor Greene Finally Got What She Deserved: Defeat\n\nThe company is placing high-end chips — similar to ones it designed for the Mac — in cloud-computing servers designed to process the most advanced AI tasks coming to Apple devices, according to people familiar with the matter. Simpler AI-related features will be processed directly on iPhones, iPads and Macs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan is still under wraps.\n\nThe move is part of Apple’s much-anticipated push into generative artificial intelligence — the technology behind ChatGPT and other popular tools. The company is playing catch-up with Big Tech rivals in the area but is poised to lay out an ambitious AI strategy at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10.\n\nApple’s plan to use its own chips and process AI tasks in the cloud was hatched about three years ago, but the company accelerated the timeline after the AI craze — fueled by OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini — forced it to move more quickly.\n\nThe first AI server chips will be the M2 Ultra, which was launched last year as part of the Mac Pro and Mac Studio computers, though the company is already eyeing future versions based on the M4 chip.\n\nApple shares briefly reached a session high of $184.59 in New York trading after Bloomberg reported the details. The stock is down more than 4% for the year. A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot\n\nRelatively simple AI tasks — like providing users a summary of their missed iPhone notifications or incoming text messages — could be handled by the chips inside of Apple devices. More complicated jobs, such as generating images or summarizing lengthy news articles and creating long-form responses in emails, would likely require the cloud-based approach — as would an upgraded version of Apple’s Siri voice assistant.\n\nThe move, coming as part of Apple’s iOS 18 rollout in the fall, represents a shift for the company. For years, Apple prioritized on-device processing, touting it as a better way to ensure security and privacy. But people involved in the creation of the Apple server project — code-named ACDC, or Apple Chips in Data Centers — say that components already inside of its processors can safeguard user privacy. The company uses an approach called Secure Enclave that can isolate data from a security breach.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, Apple is planning to use its own data centers to operate the cloud features, but it will eventually rely on outside facilities — as it does with iCloud and other services. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on some aspects of the server plan.\n\nNever miss an episode. Follow The Big Take daily podcast today.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, hinted at the approach on an earnings call last week. “We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties,” he said after being asked about the company’s AI infrastructure. “It’s a model that has worked well for us historically, and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.”\n\nRead More: Inside Apple’s Big Plan to Bring Generative AI to All Its Devices\n\nHandling AI features on devices will still be a big part of Apple’s AI strategy. But some of those capabilities will require its most recent chips, such as the A18 launched in last year’s iPhone and the M4 chip that debuted in the iPad Pro earlier this week. Those processors include significant upgrades to the so-called neural engine, the part of the chip that handles AI tasks.\n\nApple is rapidly upgrading its product line with more powerful chips. In a first, it’s bringing a next-generation processor — the M4 — to its entire range of Mac computers. The Mac mini, iMac and MacBook Pro will get the M4 later this year, and the chip will go into the MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro next year, Bloomberg News reported in April.\n\nRead More: Apple Plans to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips\n\nTaken together, the plans lay the groundwork for Apple to weave AI into much of its product line. The company will focus on features that make life easier for users as they go about their day — say, by making suggestions and offering a customized experience. Apple isn’t planning to roll out its own ChatGPT-style service, though it’s been in discussions about offering that option through a partnership.\n\nJust last week, Apple said the ability to run AI on its devices will help it stand out from rivals.\n\n“We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the earnings call.\n\nWithout getting into specifics, Cook said that Apple’s in-house semiconductors would give it in an edge in this still-nascent field. He added that the company’s privacy focus “underpins everything we create.”\n\nThe company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the cloud-based initiative over the past three years, according to the people. But there are still gaps in its offerings. For users who want a chatbot, Apple has held discussions with Alphabet Inc.’s Google and OpenAI about integrating one into the iPhone and iPad.\n\nRead More: Tim Cook Can’t Run Apple Forever. Who’s Next?\n\nTalks with OpenAI have recently intensified, suggesting that a partnership is likely.

        "title": "3 Promising Robotaxi Stocks to Snap Up Before August 8",
        "content": "When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced its August 8 robotaxi event, enthusiasm for autonomous driving got a shot in the arm. Indeed, Tesla stock also received a much-needed jolt as it looked to reverse gears after a nasty drawdown.\n\nEarlier this year, excitement and hope in full-self-driving (FSD) technology and the concept of robotaxis faded a bit. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reportedly pulled the plug on its Apple Car (or Project Titan) program. However, Tesla’s August 8 event may very well bring to hype back. In any case, it will be very interesting to see if what Tesla unveils will help propel the robotaxi and autonomous driving trends back into the driver’s seat again.\n\nOnly time will tell what the big day will have in store for TSLA stock and self-driving plays as a whole. Regardless, I believe they’re worth watching (and perhaps buying) as they drive into August.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s been an awful year for Tesla so far, with shares down 30% year-to-date. For now, not everybody is euphoric about Tesla. It has grappled with rough industry headwinds. Furthermore, considerable negative momentum weighing down its stock.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, deliveries were down 8.5% as electric vehicle (EV) demand took a breather. There doesn’t appear to be any signs of a swift reversal ahead for Tesla or the EV industry. However, investors could begin to be more forgiving of further weak quarterly results. They may hope that August 8 will unleash something truly game-changing for the robotaxi industry.\n\nAlso, the Robotaxi event will lay out a roadmap, perhaps a multi-year one, for the gradual release of its robotaxi. And, the degree of autonomy seems unlikely to be here yet. If Musk delivers more clarity and specifics on Tesla’s longer-term robotaxi plans, the firm may beckon longer-term investors to scoop up TSLA stock on weakness.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Chinese internet juggernaut that has not been going anywhere fast. The stock is still down over 67% from its February 2021 peak. And, seems to be sinking again after a brief rebound in the back half of 2022.\n\nWith its latest agreement to provide mapping data to Tesla to help aid its FSD tech in China, BIDU is a must-watch stock. In fact, the deal stands out as a potentially huge win for both companies as they seek to collaborate. Many may underestimate the potential for a Tesla-Baidu partnership.\n\nTesla aside, Baidu has been working on its own autonomous driving tech for many years. Leveraging its AI expertise with its Apollo self-driving program, Baidu is a standout way to play the future of the robotaxi and FSD scene.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 14.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), Baidu stands out as a potentially glorious bargain for investors willing to venture into the hard-hit Chinese market. The company is innovating on many fronts, from generative AI to self-driving.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nRobotaxi and FSD projects represent just a small piece of the pie for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). It seeks to defend its Google search platform from potential AI disruptors while also betting big on AI itself. With its large language model (LLM) of Google Gemini and its stake in private AI firm Anthropic, Alphabet is a top-two AI stock to own for the long run.\n\nSelf-driving capabilities and AI go hand-in-hand. Its Waymo division is testing the roads (without a driver) in certain areas. So, it certainly seems like the emerging robotaxi market is Alphabet’s for the taking. And yet, Waymo isn’t quite perfect yet. A notable February accident could set a nationwide rollout back by quite a bit. In any case, I do not doubt Waymo will improve by leaps and bounds over time.\n\nAs a top rival of Tesla’s robotaxi, it will be interesting to see if Alphabet has anything in store for Waymo.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Alphabet (Class C) and Apple.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Under-$20 Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 have gained 6% and 10% year-to-date, now is the time to buy undervalued stocks under $20.\n\nInvestors are anticipating three rate cuts from a now dovish Federal Reserve, and even though GDP growth slowed down in Q1, corporate profits are strong, which is often a good sign of how healthy the market is.\n\nInvestors are happy because the economy is neither too hot (which may produce inflation and an overheated economy) nor too cold (which could bring a recession)—a Goldilocks state. This equilibrium boosts stock prices; Goldman Sachs predicts the S&P 500 will rise 6% to 4,700 in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the middle of this, we will explore three undervalued stocks under $20, all with more than 50% upside.\n\nThe first competitor, a former mobile phone service giant, is making a strong return by shifting its focus to 5G technology. The second pick works in quantum computing, a niche area expected to expand by 33% in five years. The final stock is a key oil transportation provider, profiting from increased worldwide shipping costs.\n\nNokia (NOK) Nokia (NOK) sign, logo, emblem at Nokia Solutions and Networks building, branch of global Finnish company, telecommunications equipment supplier.\n\nSource: OleksSH / Shutterstock.com\n\nFormer mobile phone giant Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is a 5G contender, with a potential 60% upside from a $6 average price target versus the last close of $3.74.\n\nNokia plans to achieve a 13% operating margin by 2026 in its new company strategy and business goals. To streamline operations and focus on 5G, safety, and SaaS, Nokia will sell Lumine Group its Device Management and Service Management Platform businesses to improve efficiency for $203.1 million.\n\nNokia’s portfolio management is shown by its sale of VitalQIP technology to Cygna Labs Corp. and the adoption of Red Hat as its network app infrastructure. Nokia is also changing how Mobile Networks work to expand its business into O-RAN, Cloud RAN, and the military.\n\nPatents are very important to Nokia because they protect its new ideas and keep the company ahead of the competition in the tech industry. On that note, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsungnow have long-term technology license deals with Nokia, covering cars, media players, and consumer gadgets.\n\nRegarding recent milestones, Nokia finished the first Cloud RAN test with In-Line acceleration for MEA, which improved mobile network technology. Additionally, Nokia and Zayo set a record for North America’s longest live network transfer distance at 800Gb/s.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Nokia is developing new products and revamping models, such as the Nokia 2660 Flip, which has new colors. It also hints at a 5G version for India, perhaps the Nokia G42 5G.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) A concept image of a processor representing quantum computing. IONQ Stock. quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Amin Van / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuantum computing play IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is not profitable as of yet. However, considering the allure of quantum computing, a market expected to grow at 33% between 2024 and 2029, the market opportunity is tremendous, reflected by its “Strong Buy,” rating and 86% upside potential.\n\nBut the proof is in the pudding: IonQ reached 35 algorithmic qubits on its IonQ Forte platform, one year ahead of schedule, a major engineering milestone.\n\nIonQ also took a big step toward building future quantum networks by adding to its technology skills. It’s working on adding optical interconnects to allow processing across quantum networks, which is very different from traditional setups, where work is split up among many separate cores and processors.\n\nIonQ also revealed that the first specialized quantum computing production plant will open in the U.S. in Bothell, Washington. This is a big step toward making quantum computing available to the public.\n\nAdditionally, IonQ’s systems are now available on almost all major cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and can accessed directly through APIs.\n\nDHT Holdings (DHT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDHT Holdings (NYSE:DHT) completes our list of undervalued stocks under $20, a large oil tanker firm potentially benefitting from global shipping price improvements.\n\nWall Street analysts rate DHT a “moderate buy,” with an average price goal of $19, implying 63% upside.\n\nDHT Holdings predicted $50,900 per day from time charters in Q1 2024 in April. Its spot market and time charter VLCCs make $54,000 and $39,500 daily, respectively. Despite being lower than the spot market, the time charter rate provides steady income, but spot market charters illustrate strong demand.\n\nAlong with the $54,200 discharge-to-discharge rate, 42% of second-quarter 2024 spot days are booked. Spot and time-charter days—54% of possible earnings—are at $46,900 per day.\n\nGeopolitical energy and transportation events benefit DHT Holdings. The oil produced worldwide could go down by 500,000 to 2 million barrels per day in a “small disruption” scenario, increasing DHT Holdings’ oil tanker demand.\n\nMiddle Eastern conflict has increased “ton-miles” (cargo volume and distance) by raising crude oil prices and road length. Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, allow DHT’s tanker fleet to transport large amounts over long hauls during geopolitical tensions, boosting profits.\n\nDHT Holdings will build four VLCCs in South Korea from April to December 2026, helping leverage increased demand and charter prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

Google – The Battle For AI Dominance\n\nCommentators highlighted Microsoft’s exceptional leadership and its dominance in AI talent as key indicators of strength. Despite criticisms about its AI capabilities, particularly compared to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), known as Google, Microsoft’s strategic application of AI has been a standout feature. Its multifaceted approach, spanning cloud computing, software development, gaming, hardware design, search, advertising, and acquisitions like GitHub and LinkedIn, underscores its status as a diversified powerhouse. “It’s more like a mini etf itself,” commented Redditor St3w1e0.\n\nComment\r\n byu/Physioweng from discussion\r\n instocks\n\nThe debate over AI leadership between Microsoft and Google sparked further analysis. While Google is recognized for its innovative prowess, commentators noted Microsoft’s practical application and superior execution in AI.\n\nMicrosoft’s ability to find real-world applications for AI technologies has given it an edge, contrasting with Google’s struggles to maintain product continuity.\n\nAlso Read: Google’s DeepMind Co-Founder Mustafa Suleyman, Shares His Exciting First Month At Microsoft: ‘Truly Transformational’\n\nMicrosoft Vs.

        "title": "The 3 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "On May 4, value investing disciples trooped to Omaha, Nebraska, for Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) annual general meeting. Everyone was eager to hear what Warren Buffett had to say about the economy and Berkshire’s operations. The company’s vaunted equity portfolio is a north star for many value investors seeking the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.\n\nInvestors always want to follow Buffett, one of the greatest value investors of our time. The Oracle of Omaha sticks to value investing principles, purchasing high-quality businesses for a reasonable price.\n\nDue to his strict selection criteria, the portfolio comprises some of the best wide-moat businesses. Even better, Buffett states his holding period is forever. So, his picks are businesses with durable competitive advantages that can compound earnings over decades. Looking at the current portfolio, here are some of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest holding in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, accounting for nearly 40% of holdings. That’s why the markets took note when Berkshire disclosed it trimmed its stake by 13%. However, Buffett quelled any fears about AAPL stock, saying it would continue to be Berkshire’s largest holding.\n\nThe iPhone maker suffered mixed fortunes in recent quarters. Although the company’s Services segment has been growing, product revenues are on the decline. As a result, total revenues declined in five of the last six quarters.\n\nThat said, the market is forward-looking. That is why the stock rallied over 6% on May 3 after Apple posted its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Despite the revenue decline of 4.3% from a year ago, the market took positives from management commentary that iPhone revenues could begin growing again. Particularly encouraging was the rebound in China; CEO Tim Cook stated that he was very optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term.\n\nHowever, artificial intelligence is the main catalyst that makes Apple one of the best Buffett stocks to buy. Management teased its AI rollout and investors are predicting a huge announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. For now, Apple is still a cash-generating machine and a $110 billion stock buyback will provide a floor on the stock.\n\nBerkshire owns 789.6 million shares of AAPL stock, with its overall stake valued at $143.9 billion.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cans\n\nSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of returns, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been one of the best investments Buffett has made. The soft drink giant retained its moat and earned impressive returns on equity since Buffett started buying in 1988. Still, it’s among the best Buffett stocks to buy. Berkshire currently holds 400 million shares of KO stock, a stake valued at $25.1 billion and 7% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.\n\nScanning the equity landscape, few companies have the brand strength of Coca-Cola. It sells 1.9 billion servings each day of its popular drinks in more than 200 countries. It is the most valuable soft drink brand, giving it immense pricing power. Additionally, its global scale provides a significant cost advantage against competition.\n\nIndeed, Q1 2024 results proved that Coca-Cola’s brand strength remains intact. The results showed that it increased prices by 13% but still grew unit case volumes by 1%. This highlights that it can raise prices without pushback from consumers.\n\nDue to its significant profitability, Coca-Cola is also a Dividend Aristocrat—an S&P 500 company that increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. KO recorded 61 consecutive years of dividend growth, making it one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy for dividends.\n\nAs of this writing, KO stock trades for 21 times forward earnings. Quench your portfolio thirst and earn a 3.1% dividend yield.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs one of the oldest portfolio holdings, American Express (NYSE:AXP) deserves a mention due to its durability. The credit card company has been a mainstay in Buffett’s portfolio since the 1960s. Over the years, the business grew tremendously due to the shift from cards to cash.\n\nThe move to cards is still ongoing and that’s why AXP stock is one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy. According to recent results, the company isn’t resting on its laurels and is executing flawlessly. On April 19, it reported first-quarter revenues increased by 11% from a year ago to $15.8 billion. What’s more, diluted EPS increased from $2.40 to $3.33, an increase of 39%.\n\nManagement noted that it saw a high engagement level among premium customers. It expects the earnings momentum to continue as the company adds more members and spending increases in their high credit-quality cohort. In line with this view, they issued 2024 guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.\n\nThe guidance means that AXP is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times. Over the long term, the bet on millennials and Gen Z presents a significant growth runway. Furthermore, with only a 6% market share in its top five international markets, there is plenty of expansion upside.\n\nBerkshire owns 151.6 million shares of AXP stock, or just more than 20% of the company’s total shares. The stake is valued at $37.5 billion and makes up nearly 10% of Berkshire’s total portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "While it isn't necessarily a great idea to buy a stock just because a billionaire owns it, looking at the top holdings of some of the most successful investors in the world can be a great starting point to finding excellent opportunities.\n\nThere are several stocks that are popular among billionaires I wouldn't touch right now. But there are others that look extremely attractive at current levels. Here are two in particular that could be massive long-term winners for patient investors that are worth a closer look right now.\n\nA rock-solid bank with long-tailed potential\n\nIt's well known that the largest stock position in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). But the second largest stock chosen by Warren Buffett for the conglomerate's massive portfolio could be the better value right now.\n\nI'm talking about Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Berkshire owns 13.2% of the mega-bank, a stake worth more than $39 billion as of this writing. In fact, during the banking turmoil in mid-2023, Buffett unloaded several bank stocks, but specifically called out Bank of America as one he likes.\n\nBank of America is a highly profitable business, but it isn't without its headwinds. The bank's cost of capital has risen in the current interest rate environment and its net interest margin has declined by 21 basis points over the past year. And like most banks, Bank of America's net charge-off ratio has increased significantly over the past year.\n\nHowever, Bank of America is a tremendous institution that could be a big beneficiary once interest rates start to fall. It has the No. 1 retail deposit market share and continues to grow impressively. Unlike several other megabanks, Bank of America's deposit base has grown over the past year, and it added 245,000 net new checking accounts and more than 1 million credit card accounts in the first quarter alone. Its investment banking market share is 115 basis points higher than a year ago. And client balances in the Global Wealth and Investment Management business are at an all-time high of $4 trillion.\n\nIn a nutshell, Bank of America is well positioned for when rates start to fall and economic uncertainty starts to subside. Plus, it trades for a lower price-to-book valuation than its peers, despite being a rock-solid institution.\n\nBillionaires love this Magnificent Seven stock\n\nBill Ackman, head of the Pershing Square hedge fund, is one of the most closely followed billionaires. Like Buffett, most of the stocks he buys are more toward the value end of the spectrum. In fact, there's only one technology stock you'll find in Ackman's portfolio, and it happens to be Pershing Square's single largest investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'm talking about Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). At the end of 2023, Pershing Square owned 13.7 million shares of the tech giant, a stake worth more than $2.3 billion today. And it isn't just Ackman: Alphabet is the most commonly held tech stock among the most notable hedge fund managers, according to our research.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Ackman and other billionaires might be a big fan of Alphabet. It's rare to find a highly profitable business that dominates an industry like Google dominates internet search and several other areas, and it's even more rare when the business also has massive growth potential.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, in addition to the familiar Google businesses like search, YouTube, Gmail, and others, Alphabet also has Google Cloud, which is the third largest cloud services company in the market and has tons of room to grow. The global cloud computing market is expected to roughly quadruple by 2030, fueled by technologies like AI, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and more, so even if Google Cloud simply maintains its market share, there could be massive potential.\n\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew by 15%, led by 28% year-over-year revenue growth from Google Cloud. The business is an absolute cash machine, with a 32% operating margin, and the company is buying back tons of stock and just announced its first-ever quarterly dividend.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nTo be perfectly clear, it's not a smart idea to buy stocks just because billionaires own them. Even if the billionaire happens to be named Warren Buffett. After all, billionaires may have investment goals and risk tolerance levels that differ greatly from yours.\n\nHaving said that, these two billionaire favorites are also excellent businesses with long-tailed growth tailwinds. If you have the patience to hold them for at least the next few years, they could certainly be worth a closer look right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech is embracing a hallmark of pre-internet stocks",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA fresh Big Tech boomlet has arrived.\n\nShareholders aren't just seeing their stock prices swell, they are getting paid too. The dividend, its importance demoted over the past couple of decades by the tech boom, is having a moment again thanks in part to the same companies that made it passé.\n\nIn February, META (META) initiated a dividend, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) followed in April. And then came an increase from Apple (AAPL) last week.\n\nBut why are tech companies initiating payouts, and why now?\n\nThe dividend trend reflects the double role that tech giants hold in society and on Wall Street. They want to be perceived as growth engines, obsessed with frontier tech and fixated on reshaping the future. But they are also mature, cash-rich companies with market caps that start with a \"T.\"\n\nThe former fledglings are now apex predators, seasoned with decades of experience balancing new investments with their core business, which happens to be expanding to virtually every domain of life.\n\nStartup versions of these companies would scoff at the idea of paying back a dividend. It suggests their growth days are behind them, that executives don't have a vision for how to deploy their resources. But in this post-pandemic, pre-AI moment, Big Tech wants to prove they can do two things at once: build the infrastructure to dominate the coming era and show investors they have the fiscal discipline and confidence to return value consistently.\n\nThat the recent wave of dividend announcements has come alongside disclosures of ballooning AI spending reinforces the dual message.\n\nBut it also reflects a reenergized corporate America that has shaken off fears of the recession that never was. Earnings are rising and with it are massive stock buybacks. The recent wave of repurchases, including Apple's record-breaking $110 billion plan, is the largest sum of buybacks since 2018.\n\n\"These companies have seen record profits for some time now and are finding value in passing that profit to shareholders rather than capex,\" said Alex McGrath, chief investment officer at NorthEnd Private Wealth. \"Not to say they are not still heavily investing in growth, but the cash flow has now reached a point where this begins to make sense.\"\n\nShareholder payouts, even modest ones from the tech companies, also grant them entry into funds that require a dividend. They are broadening their pool of investors, drawing from portfolios that seek steady income from dividends and people who simply want to see the \"number go up\" on their brokerage accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was the staggering gains of internet companies that played a part in making the dividend seem stodgy and antiquated. Top members of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\" come from the consumer staples and industrials sectors. When you typically think of dividends, you're disconnected from ideas of rapid growth, more risk, and big gains.\n\nBut the mega tech companies have changed. And so has what a dividend company looks like. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg's glow up.\n\n\"If they keep the money internally, there is a tendency to have waste. By paying it out, it instills discipline,\" said Jennifer Koski, professor of finance at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington, who has been teaching dividend cases for the Big Tech companies since before Microsoft (MSFT) initiated its own in 2003. \"The AI spending is their signal we still do have growth opportunities.\"\n\nIn a sign of where things are headed, Koski is planning to teach her next payout policy case. This time, on Amazon (AMZN).\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter @hshaban. morning brief image\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 9, 2024 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \" The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 440 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods.\"\n\nEarnings Growth Poised to Accelerate\n\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nTotal earnings for the 440 S&P 500 members that have reported Q1 results are up +5.0% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.0% beating EPS estimates and 60.9% beating revenue estimates. The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 440 index members represents a modest acceleration from what we had seen in other recent periods. The +5% earnings growth pace improves to +11.9% once the Energy sector and Bristol Myers’s one-time charge are accounted for. For 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.2% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues. Estimates have been increasing since the start of April, with the current +9.2% earnings growth pace up from +8.7% on April 3rd. Looking at the calendar year picture, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow by +8.9% this year after last year’s modest decline. Excluding the hefty Tech sector contribution, whose 2024 earnings are expected to be up +15.9%, earnings for the rest of the index would be up only +6.3%.\n\nWe have consistently flagged signs of improvement in the overall revisions trend in recent weeks, with estimates starting to go modestly up. We are seeing this trend for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as for full-year 2024 estimates.\n\nThis new development has roughly coincided with the start of the Q1 earnings season. That said, several sectors, including Tech and Retail, had already been enjoying positive estimate revisions for quite some time. At present, half of the 16 Zacks sectors have higher aggregate earnings estimates than expected at the start of the year.\n\nWe have recently highlighted the favorable revisions trend for the Energy sector in this space. This week, we will discuss the evolving earnings outlook for the ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks.\n\nPlease note that the $443.9 billion the group is currently expected to earn in 2024 is up from $438.1 billion last week and $428.2 billion the week prior to that.\n\nWe all know that the revisions trend for Tesla TSLA has been negative for a while now, while the same for Apple AAPL is also negative, though the magnitude of negative revisions for Apple is far less severe.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe revisions trend for the remaining five members of this group is positive enough to more than offset the Tesla and Apple effects. Of these five, Nvidia NVDA is in a league of its own.\n\nA big part of this year’s earnings growth is expected to come from margins reversing last year’s declines and starting to expand again. The expectation is that aggregate net margins this year get back to the 2022 level, with the Tech sector driving most of the gains.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

We had a strong start with Q1 results above the high end of our guidance range across all metrics. X-tack of $139 million grew 20% versus last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $23 million grew more than 100% free cash flow was nearly $27 million in Q1 and also more than doubled last year.\r\n All metrics beat the high end of our guidance range and are on track to meet our full year 2024 guidance. I'm also encouraged to see that our growth rates are accelerating compared to last year. Looking at our use of cash over 100% of free cash flow in Q1 was spent on share buybacks, demonstrating our strong commitment to shareholder returns and confidence in our long-term strategy and ability to execute with a strong Q1 and Q2 guidance showing double digit growth versus the same time last year.\r\n We are reiterating our 2024 guidance, which projects accelerated growth on every metric and making 2024 for a record year for us. Revenue growing 33% to nearly $2 billion, X-Tack growing 25% to almost $670 million. Adjusted EBITDA of over $200 million, growing approximately 2x 2023 and over $100 million of free cash flow, which is also two times 2023 levels.\r\n When looking at our core business. Our main focus is, first, making our advertisers successful and in return growing our yield year over year and a second and a big focus for us this year is ramping young, starting with our initiatives driving advertiser success.\r\n I can tell you just come back from an upside where a lot of what we talked about is our goal to expand our initiatives to make to build a company recognized for quality across all fronts, delivering premium experiences to users and publishers while attracting Tier one performance advertisers.\r\n As I wrote in my shareholder letter. I am happy to report that we've just crossed the 20% mark of our revenue being driven by top brands and agencies, and it's growing fast. We think there's a big upside here in many ways, more than have imagined in the past. You will hear me speak a lot about it this year and onwards. As I think this can be material to our partners as well as for us driving yields even faster.\r\n Let me share a bit more about this. We have recently launched select as a way for premium performance advertisers to reach our top 15% of publishers, which includes Yahoo Apple, NBC, Disney and more with a premium standalone ad experience.\r\n Big brands are willing to pay a premium for it were focused exclusively on performance. This is not a branding play. We're not looking for top of the funnel budget here, but to enable big performance budgets to go beyond social and search to the open web and Taboola as new offerings between TiVo select our Yahoo partnership, our Apple partnership and the success of Tier one advertisers such as Hulu, Citi Verizon.\r\n We hope to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and help drive yields even faster. Our biggest R&D and product investment is making advertisers successful. I'm happy to share that Maximus conversions adoption continues to grow and is now almost 60% of our revenue. We're focused on improving our retention rates and increasing budgets, also known as NDR.\r\n We're seeing encouraging results from advertisers migrating to MAX conversion and AI, including double digit growth in NDR for advertisers who have migrated to MAX conversion versus ones was not and improving retention rates.\r\n Our main work here is to reduce calls, start by training our AI models and taking advantage of the massive amount of first-party data and clickstream to look for similar best advertisers and bring that know-how front and center.\r\n Switching gears to our second top priority this year ramping up. We're on track to complete the migration by midyear as planned, and we continue to make progress migrating Yahoo's Tier one omnichannel advertisers switchable on.\r\n And we've achieved our goal in Q1 to exceed $100 million in revenue on our supply. While there is still a lot of work to be done, we couldn't be more pleased with the partnership with Yahoo. The work between our leaderships at encouraging performance advertisers are seen when using tablet technology.\r\n One was a success story was with one of the world's largest personal finance software companies where the ads performance was so strong that they increased their budget more than two times over the course of the campaign and are now one of the largest advertisers under Taboola network.\r\n If there was ever a proof that AI matters, this is a good example of it. We spoke last quarter about our relationship with Apple, and I'm happy to share that it has now expanded to new markets. Previously, Apple has selected us to monetize Apple News and Apple stocks as an authorized reseller starting in Australia and Canada. And just recently, we expanded our role to serve as an authorized reseller for Apple News and Apple stocks in the US and UK markets.\r\n I could not be more proud of the tubular team supporting our efforts here, and we have a lot to learn as we onboard this amazing new partnership and I remain confident that Apple will become one of our most important partners.\r\n Turning now to our growth engines to revenues, e-commerce and our better overall product innovation and commercial wins continue to drive our momentum here. Our key investments, particularly news is getting more vertical videos, real-time content onto it, similar to what you're seeing on Instagram or Snap. And we're seeing great user engagement.\r\n In addition, while introducing various utilities, users may like to engage with such as weather or gaming and more. And our ambition here is to over the next many, many years to have people spend over 20 minutes a day with us.\r\n My product team likes to refer to it. We have a chance to become the main dish on the e-commerce front, we had a great quarter, growing solid double digit and exceeding our expectations. Again, we launched Associated Press new e-commerce site powered by Taboola, and it's beautiful. We should check it out, it's called AP. Buyline.\r\n It gives people a chance to check product reviews and make decisions that matter to them, leveraging the trust of AP and our relationships with retailers We also recently integrated with Amazon's DSP to allow Amazon sellers to extend their budgets into Taboola. As an example, let's say you have a store in Amazon and you want to reach buyers in the open web.\r\n You can now extend your reach using Amazon's DSP unattainable or Open Web network of publishers. Our header bidder is still small, but the potential here over time is to integrate across our thousands of publishers, including Yahoo into their display stack, which is an opportunity that can be quite meaningful. We are extremely excited by the prospects of our tubular growth engines and our ability to create synergies with our core business over the long term.\r\n In summary, we're coming in strong into 2024, exceeding our high end of guidance across all metrics, expecting double digit growth in Q2 over last year, while reiterating our 2024 guidance making this year a record year for us, our revenue growth is accelerating while having a strong EBITDA of over $200 million and over $100 million of free cash flow, we're continuing our $1 billion of buyback authorization and we're laser focused this year on advertiser success, which should result in sales growth and ramping up Yahoo.\r\n With that, let me pass the call to Steve to review our financials and outlook in more detail.\n\nStory continues\n\nStephen Walker\n\nThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, we had a strong start to 2024. Our Q1 revenues were approximately $414 million and grew 26% year over year, accelerating from Q4 levels. X-tack gross profit was $139 million, which represented growth of 20% year over year X-Tack growth was driven by double digit growth in advertising spend as we onboarded Yahoo.\r\n Advertisers and saw the benefit of having Yahoo supply available through our platform as well as by accelerating growth in our e-commerce business. In addition, we saw double digit growth in our premium brand and advertising demand spend, which included strong organic growth as well as the transitioning of advertising spend from Yahoo's platform to boule.\r\n One note on our financials that is new this quarter on each of our financial statements in our 10-Q, you will note related party callouts, for instance, on our income statement, you will see that we call out related party revenue and traffic acquisition costs.\r\n As you might guess those related party numbers are for Yahoo. Traffic acquisition cost disclosure is relatively simple. This is the revenue share we pay to Yahoo and it flows through to payables on the balance sheet and change of payables in the cash flow statement. The related party revenue is not quite as simple to understand.\r\n There are three types of advertisers spending on Yahoo. Supply. First, there are what we have historically called omnichannel advertisers. These are advertisers that buy multiple advertising formats through the Yahoo. Dsp display, video and native.\r\n They are still billed and collected by Yahoo. But all of the native revenue is spent on the two bullet platform. So they are recognized by people as revenue and appear as related party revenue.\r\n The second type of advertiser is an advertiser that historically was only spending on native through Yahoo. No display video or other formats and has now been transitioned to bull. These advertisers do not appear in related party revenue because they're now billed and collected directly by tubular.\r\n So they are not the customer related party. The last type of advertiser is an advertiser that had not historically spent through the Yahoo platform, but is now spending on Yahoo. Supply through that to build a platform.\r\n These are historical tubular customers or new customers that we have brought on. They also do not appear in related party revenue since they are billed and collected by to go on. I will note that there is a small amount of other revenue in the related party disclosure that is either from other related parties, companies related to Yahoo or other advertisers that spend through Yahoo on to go up but not through the DSP. However, these are very small part of the related party revenue.\r\n I will also note that the related party revenue also flows through to the balance sheet in the receivables line and into the cash flow statement in the change of receivables. I hope that help explains what is in the related party disclosures.\r\n Now let me get back to our regularly scheduled programming. In Q1 Our net loss was $26.2 million, and our non-GAAP net income was positive $3.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.5 million, representing a 17% adjusted EBITDA margin year over year.\r\n Adjusted EBITDA was down, which was due primarily to higher expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo supply that were not in the year-ago period and which preceded the full benefit of Yahoo advertiser transitions.\r\n Free cash flow benefited from the strong stronger than forecasted adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by the expenses related to the onboarding of Yahoo. We are very happy that our teams drove accelerating revenue and ex tech performance in Q1 through the remainder of the year, we expect improving cost efficiency, especially as the revenue from Yahoo. Advertiser transitions catch up with the associated costs, which will drive margin expansion.\r\n Operating expenses were $127 million in Q1, up $9 million year over year as a result of the costs incurred to onboard the significant inventory we are gaining with the addition of Yahoo. We continue to focus on cost discipline despite the hiring required to support onboarding Yahoo.\r\n Our headcount is still roughly flat relative to its peak in July of 2022. With this ongoing expense discipline and our strong growth expectations, we continue to expect that in 2024, we will approach our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30%.\r\n Gaap net loss for Q1 of $26.2 million included amortization of intangibles of $15.9 million, share-based compensation expenses of $13.8 million and hold back compensation expenses related to the connection to the acquisition of $2.6 million, all of which were excluded from non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net income of $3.8 million was above the high end of our guidance range.\r\n In terms of cash generation, we had approximately $32.4 million in operating cash flow in Q1 and free cash flow of $26.8 million. This includes net publisher prepayments, which were a source of cash of $7.3 million and interest payments on our long-term debt, which were a use of cash of $3.6 million.\r\n As I have highlighted in previous quarters. I would note that net publisher prepayments were a source of cash this quarter due to the fact that new prepayments were lower than the amortization of historical prepayments.\r\n Let's turn to the balance sheet, you can see that our net cash balance remains healthy. Our net cash position of $35.5 million remained positive at the end of Q1 even after share repurchases, cash and cash equivalents, plus our short-term investments were $181 million at the end of Q1. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments remained above our long-term loan balance of $145.5 million.\r\n Speaking of our share repurchases, we repurchased $28 million of shares in Q1. We still have $92 million of authorizations under our previously announced $100 million expansion of our repurchase plan. When we initiated our buyback program, we stated that our intent was to at least offset any dilution and maintain our issued and outstanding shares at end of Q1 2023 levels.\r\n You can see that we have exceeded that goal as our issued and outstanding shares at the end of Q1 2024 were lower than the end of Q1 2023 by almost 5 million shares.\r\n In terms of future use of cash, we continue to be able to fund our organic growth investments from our operating cash flow. As we said last quarter, we believe that at current valuations, the best use of our free cash flow is to buy back shares.\r\n To the extent that we have additional cash to deploy, we will consider paying down our long-term debt. As always, both share repurchases and early retirement of debt are contingent upon the availability of sufficient working capital. I'm also happy to report that the process in Israel for share repurchases has been updated for Israeli companies like to Bourla with securities listed outside Israel.\r\n Under the new process, we must post the notice on our website that we intend to buy back shares. And if no creditors object within 30 days, we can begin the buybacks. The process still requires our board to conclude that we meet a financial strength test as specified in the rules. So going forward, you may see us post notices of our intention to buy back shares to our investor page.\r\n Now let me shift to our forward looking guidance. Two important expectations are included in this guidance first, while there is significant work left to be done, we expect the Yahoo advertiser migration to be complete by the middle of this year, and we will continue ramping Yahoo into 2025.\r\n Second, we expect yield growth to turn positive in 2024 as the volume of our contextual data increases with the addition of Yahoo and other supply to our network and our investments in performance advertising, bear fruit. As I mentioned, we are very happy with the strong start to 2024, and we are reiterating our guidance for 2024.\r\n This guidance implies strong top line growth and improving profitability. We expect revenue of $1.89 billion to $1.94 billion, which represents growth of 33% at the midpoint. We expect gross profit of $535 million to $555 million and X-Tack gross profit of $656 million to $679 million.\r\n That ex is up roughly 25% year over year at the midpoint, we are reiterating our 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of over $200 million and free cash flow expectation of over $100 million. I will note that the adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance represents roughly a doubling of both metrics versus 2023.\r\n Finally, we are expecting non-GAAP net income of $84 million to $104 million in 2024. We are also introducing Q2 2024 guidance. This quarter, we expect revenues of $410 million to $440 million, gross profit of $110 million to $120 million, X-Tack gross profit of $140 million to $150 million, adjusted EBITDA of $20 million to $30 million and non-GAAP net income of zero to positive $10 million.\r\n Let me finish by saying that we are very happy with our first quarter performance. Our growth is accelerating in 2024, and I'm looking forward to the step change we are expecting in our financials in 2024. The growth investments we have made in 2023.\r\n The additional scale that Yahoo is bringing and the additional supply, we will be onboarding as part of a new partnership with Apple is accelerating our journey towards becoming a must-buy for advertisers looking to reach consumers and the open web.\r\n And with that, let me pass it back to Adam for some closing remarks.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nThanks, Steve. In summary, it's great to see our business momentum and growth rates accelerating. It's an exciting time for us to hit the boiler seen our investments pending out.\r\n Starting with our financials, we started 2024 strong with a beat above our high end of guidance across all metrics, our growth rates are accelerating, which is good to see. In Q2, we're guiding for double digit growth versus Q2 of last year and 2024 is a record year for us overall with nearly $2 billion in revenue north of $200 million of EBITDA and over $100 million of free cash flow.\r\n We're executing on our buyback program, which demonstrates our confidence in our ability to execute and create shareholder value.\r\n When looking at our business, our top two priorities this year are making advertisers successful and ramping Yahoo. On advertiser success. Mix conversion is ahead with advertisers. After six months, it's almost 60% adoption.\r\n And advertisers who have adopted are generating double digit higher NDR. We're also focusing on attracting premium advertisers, which both select accessing our top 15% of our network, including Yahoo. Disney, Apple, NBC and others on Yahoo. We're on track to complete the migration by midyear as planned, and we crossed the $100 million in Q1 as we thought. Beyond that, we're seeing great momentum.\r\n Overall, our relationship with Apple is now extending to the U.S. and U.K. beyond Canada and Australia. Our growth engines, e-commerce, tubular news and header bidding are showing strong momentum and becoming more and more synergetic to our core business, making our publisher and advertiser business stronger. I'm excited to be exactly where we are.\r\n We know what we need to do. We have an incredible team all around the world working hard to build the very first must-buy advertising company for the open web. Thank you all for being part of our journey.\r\n And with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)\r\n Laura Martin, Needham. Your line is now open.\n\nLaura Martin\n\nGood morning. Boy, there's a lot going on and great numbers guys. Congratulations. Yes, thank you, Laura. So my first question is on these priorities. I know that you're trying to onboard these omnichannel advertisers at Yahoo, but there's a lot that you're talking about in the shareholder letter about performance, high quality Pharmos appetite.\r\n So is this just an overall part of the strategy to just increase the total number of advertisers. I'm surprised that the Yahoo priority is that number one and that you've elevated this performance high quality performance advertisers to be a higher priority than Yahoo. Can you speak to that, please?\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nYes, sure, Ira. And looking forward to seeing you very soon, the event. So So overall with Yahoo. One thing that we're seeing, and I mentioned a letter also an interesting case study of a performance advertiser, one of the largest personal finance advertiser that was able to migrate and double the spend.\r\n One, Susan, the Tubular Technology in general, we're seeing something that is fairly new to us, which is we're premium advertisers that are great names in Oahu and Verizon, Samsung and names were mentioned before, are coming on board there.\r\n And when they're seeing good performance, their ability to spend a lot more is and it's quite exciting and to do willing to pay a premium for doing so, which is also why we at launch to build a Select, which is a way to essentially create like this index of the top of our company wide network between Yahoo and Apple and known design and BC. and DBC. and others, and to allow advertisers to buy a specific kind of like segregated ad unit, a standalone ad unit and pay a premium for it.\r\n So what we think is that there's an opportunity for us to grow our portion of kind of top tier performance brand advertiser. And again, this is not us top of the funnel kind of retention play. This is our by far our performance focus using the Numax conversion pixel on page, all the things we like, however, coming from agencies and brands and a lot of it, we've learned from the partnership with Yahoo.\r\n So that's why we're thinking a lot about it. That's why we've launched a with select. And that's that's a lot of what it excites me because I think as the world grows from two to three to $4 billion in revenue. There's an opportunity to become much more kind of share of wallet for brands and agencies, but performance focused on it. I think it also is an opportunity to elevate our company overall quality.\r\n So I like where it's going, and that's why I was thinking about it. What is your question about why I think performance advertisers actually the number one priority. And then by far actually maybe the number two, three and four is because I see such an opportunity to accelerate yields from where we are over the next many, many years.\r\n And if you think about that, if you can double the Company's yield, you double the Company's revenue and I think we can double and triple double it by just growing yield. And that is by far the biggest thing we can do for our company and shareholders.\r\n So we have the biggest focus on that from the performance advertising tech team or sales team, even our work with Yodle, suggesting that for top line over the next three to five years, yield expansion is by far the biggest thing we can do. And of course, in 2020 for Yahoo, is the biggest thing we have going on.\n\nLaura Martin\n\nOkay, very helpful. And then secondly, I was intrigued in the shareholder letter, you set a goal of 30 minutes of engagement a day. Could you talk about where your engagement is today and what but the core drivers of engagement growth are.\r\n How do you bridge the gap between what your engagement level is today in terms of minutes and like what is it you're going to do where the tools to get to that 30 minutes of engagement to date, which is your call?\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nYes, or the biggest driver for that is to be the news as far as we see today. So what happens is to build a new is more and more OEMs are integrating us to be in the what they call lock screen, Alex going, which is even before the consumer economy is interacting with the device itself.\r\n And then I was joking on earlier saying that my team is referring to that as the main dish, the crystal ball, it becomes the first thing they see before they even go to Facebook and Google or other apps so that we become the first thing consumers do and the average consumers of looking under lock screen over $100 times a day.\r\n Now what we see now is that over the last quarter and I mentioned that in my letter, we're introducing more and more vertical videos, think of it like reels or inadequate Snap is doing. And that is expanding engagement with consumers.\r\n And we're seeing acceleration in time and engagement. And because of that, our product roadmap this year is more and more getting oriented around one video, specifically full-screen vertical video and to utilities. As an example, we're now introducing consumers to whether we're offering them games. We're offering them to CNO if you're Vargo, what does that mean?\r\n And so we're giving you more things that you might like using AI to personalize different utilities you might like to engage with. And thanks to that we're getting more time with consumers. So we didn't share it to bill in your current kind of time. But I can tell you it's in the single digit as of now, but growing. We have some cases when it's more than 10 minutes.\r\n And I believe that over the next many, many years, my aspirations to get this to be kind of consistently double digit or 20 minutes a day. And I know my philosophy is that if you get people's time over time, you build a great business around that.\r\n So if you build something that consumers want and they use it again and again, and again, the revenue follows. And that's why we like to build a news because one, I think it helps us to become even more important to consumers.\r\n But again, it's mega synergetic to our core because Daniel, you click to go to a publisher site. It's stimulus publishers, and it allows us to become a growing source of traffic to publishers and especially with Gemini and bar, the Gemini, all the things, I think it matters to publishers a lot.\n\nLaura Martin\n\nVery helpful. Thank you, Adam, very much.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Please stand by for us question.\r\n [Mac Down] of Citizens JMP. Your line is now open.\n\nMac Down\n\nThank you for taking my questions. My first one is just after a strong beat in 1Q relative to your guidance, you left the full year guidance unchanged. If there's something that's happening in the macro or otherwise, it's preventing you from raising your guidance.\r\n And then my second question is just as you're expanding your coverage of Apple News and Apple stock to the US and UK. Can you just help contextualize the opportunity and how you expect this to impact financials in 2024? Thank you so much.\n\nStephen Walker\n\nYes. So good question on the guidance. So in terms of our full year guidance, where we're obviously happy that Q1, we grew 26% year over year on a revenue basis and 20% year over year on a stack basis. So it was a very strong quarter for us and we expect improved adjusted EBITDA margins as we move to the back half. So we're still expecting our full year adjusted EBITDA margins to be 30% or at least to approach 30%.\r\n So I think we're pretty happy with where we are 2024. In fact, is going to be a record year for us. It will be our highest X-Tack and highest adjusted EBITDA on record. So overall, we think the guidance is really strong. We feel good about where we're at, but it's still very early.\r\n So while we feel very good about where we're at with, there's a lot of work to do and we don't want to adjust the rest of the year yet being as early as it is. So we're very happy with where we stand. We're just not ready to change the full year at this point in terms of Apple opportunity?\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nYes, we don't like to speak about any specific accounts or threes, as you can imagine. But what I can tell you is one it's very exciting for us to work with a company like Apple in oh nine in four markets and obviously the UK and the US are great markets to expand our relationship with we do think that this drives two things for us as a company.\r\n One following on also Laura's question, this is a very good anchor kind of our step forward towards people are giving premium advertisers yet another way to reach consumers. So there's no more premium than Apple, and that's that's really awesome for us to have that relationship and offer that to brand quality advertisers that are looking for performance.\r\n So that's one. It fits perfectly well with our kind of elevating and getting even more access to top brands all around the world and to we do believe that Apple has a chance of becoming one of our largest partners. So I'm comfortable saying that without getting into specifics.\n\nMac Down\n\nThank you so much. That's helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\r\n Zach Cummins, B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nZach Cummins\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong Q1 results. I really just had a follow up question around kind of the assumptions that are baked into your Q2 guidance here in how we should think about the progression going into the second half of the year, just based on the unchanged outlook.\r\n And then part two is just with the expanded Apple relationship can you talk about kind of the additional work on the development side that's going to be required as you continue to onboard and ramp that relationship in second half of this year?\r\n Yes.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nSo what's the what's the question about the Q2 guidance, those specifically?\n\nZach Cummins\n\nAnd just just key assumptions that are baked into that versus I mean, the strong performance out of the gate here and kind of how we should think about the progression into the second half of the year to hit that full year guidance range of three firms.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nGot it. So I think in terms of the Q2 guidance and frankly, the full year guidance, the most important assumptions that we're making there are one that the Yahoo is fully ramped by midyear. So there's still a lot of work to do.\r\n There were, but we're making good progress. I think Adam alluded to earlier how we are seeing some really good results from some of the advertisers we brought across, but we got to finish that work and get the rest of the advertisers across so that, that's assumption.\r\n One is that that happens, we're also assuming that in the back half of the year, especially, we start to see some yield gains as we basically from those new advertisers that we're bringing across and from our own work on performance advertising that we start to see benefit from that and we start to gain some yield assumptions or some yield gains as a result.\r\n And then I think the other kind of basic assumption that we've made, which I think we talked about last quarter is that operating expenses will kind of be running at roughly Q4 levels for the year. So from a EBITDA basis, that's the basic assumption.\r\n But I think the most important two assumptions are the first two Yahoo. Ramping by midyear, and we start to see some yield gains gains as we move into the back half in terms of dev work required to make Apple's successful?\r\n Yes, I don't think there's anything. It's a it's a publisher partner of ours. So there's nothing that is dramatically special or unique or different about. It's I think all the work that we're doing on making performance advertisers successful and the performance advertising work that applies to Apple, just like it applies to any of our other publishers.\r\n So I don't think there's anything particularly unique. Obviously, they're a big partner. They have their own requirements, but that's true any of our publishers. So nothing really unique there.\n\nZach Cummins\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nThanks, Zach.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\r\n James Kopelman, TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nJames Kopelman\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking the question. First one is for Adam. You mentioned financial advertisers doubled their campaign budget or more than doubled. What was the role of AI. specifically in the success that they experienced? And how will that potentially reach reap larger benefits as more advertisers take advantage of your AI and JNI tools.\r\n And then also, I also wanted to ask about retention rates, which you mentioned benefit from training your AI models. Question is how much of your R&D budget are you allocating toward training AI models over time? And then I have a follow-up for Steve.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nSure. Good morning and good questions. So on the first question, next, conversion and AI play an incredibly important part of advertiser success. And in this case, what you're saying is is a fantastic brand name that we all know that's migrating to use to bolus core technology to roll the ads with MAX conversion and what they're seeing.\r\n And but their objective was in a very lower funnel specific metrics. They were looking to get. And once starting to work with us, they had an initial spend goal which were significant by the way, and the results were so great that they were they decided to double the spend. I don't know if that, you know, doubling came from someplace else, but I was happy to see it.\r\n But I can tell you it was all driven by AI and specifically showing that cost per acquisition is well within the range or whether we're expecting an even better. And you know, like like I told my Board yesterday, we had a meeting. I said all I want to just 1,000 of those, right? I just want to see that again and again and again, because at the end of the day. If you think about Triple M, we now reach about 600 million people a day DAUs, so roughly the size of Snapper. So and so we have significant reach and a lot of supply.\r\n So for me, if I can continue to make advertisers successful and get more budgets, I truly believe we can double and triple the company and that is why this is the number one priority for the company. And that is why we invest so much from the product and tech team on making performance advertisers successful and ideally top tier performance advertisers successful in terms of amortization, nearly half of our R&D works on a variety of different things relating to performance advertising.\r\n And I can tell you now that team presents to the Board. Every board. It's top of mind for our management team, our Board and us as a company.\r\n In terms of financials, I'm not sure if which are specifically how much dollar wise, but it's about half of our tech team. He's working on that.\n\nJames Kopelman\n\nAnd then you also asked a little bit about retention rates. So I think we disclosed in this in our shareholder letter this time that our the NDR of our advertisers that are using our AI and our new like our new tools, there have double digits improvements in their NDR, which is a great measurement of kind of how they're doing. We haven't disclosed any new information about advertiser retention rates, but obviously your NDR can't be that positive if you're losing your advertisers. So it's obviously a good sign.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nYes, I think you were asking. So what do we do now? And again, within the sort of financial cost of that. That's what we're doing it. We're essentially and that's a big transition in 2024. We're spending a lot more resources on training or AI to from a cold start perspective to look at historic data so that we can create list of recommendations that are taking advantage in a greater way from advertisers that are like you. So if you're starting a campaign with double that today.\r\n Please remember, as I said earlier, that's one of the biggest opportunities and challenges around advertiser retention is shown and success really, really fast the faster you can get them conversions, the less likely to churn.\r\n So what we're doing now is we're training our models in a significant new way to take advantage of historic data and create a better list of recommendations that can come faster to consumers so that hopefully we can make conversions come earlier in the process and from that increase retention rates so that's what we're doing now. And we've mentioned that in the letter.\n\nJames Kopelman\n\nAnd then just one last one for Steve. On the cadence for sales and marketing expense through 2024, it is your biggest OpEx line. Can you just remind us what are the key drivers this year for sales and marketing? And should it should that expense line continue to rise sequentially throughout the year, given your various investments? And do you have any other call-outs across OpEx as we go through the year?\n\nStephen Walker\n\nYes, I think so. Generally, we've hired most of the people that we're going to hire. Most of this hiring, by the way in sales and marketing is to support the transition of advertisers from Yahoo to LA and to support kind of that revenue jump.\r\n So we've hired most of what we're going to hire at this point. Q1 was a mostly full quarter for that. So while there probably will be a slight step up going forward. It's not going to be very large. So generally speaking, I think we're at about the right level, at least now, let's say we've got work left to do. We're going to finish that work over the next couple of months.\r\n And by midyear, we're supposed to be fully ramped, then we'll reevaluate. We'll just see where we're at and see if there's any need for additional resource or anything like that. But as of now, the expectation is we have what we need.\r\n And like I said, the only other call-out I would give is that we think that we're going to be roughly flat on operating expenses from here for the rest of the year. So I think generally we feel good about where we're at with the caveat that we'll reevaluate once we have all those advertisers on board and we understand what we need to do.\n\nJames Kopelman\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. I appreciate all that.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nThanks, James.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\r\n Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nJason Helfstein\n\nThanks, to your question. So two questions on just one on the progress around Europe and given you did $100 million in the quarter, and I think we had like a 450 target for the year. It would seem like you're definitely going to track above that given the seasonality.\r\n So and I don't know if you want to kind of help us think about what the new number would be, whether it's like 500 by 50.\r\n And then second, on the bag area would imply like, you know, the business is down for other. We have talked about how it's not really a fair way to look at it for a host of reasons, but were there any specific pockets of weakness either on a product side or geographic side or ad category side that we need to be mindful for on that in the quarter? Thanks.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nAlso hedging. Morning. No, so one, you know, we already crossed the $1 million as we expected, which is great to see. We'd like we'd like to see that things we say happen. And I think at this point we're looking at.\r\n Yes, as part of our core, similar to Apple, Apple's similar to other big, big partners, we have in a way that we have one source of demand and that demand has been distributed across multiple types of publishers, some big and some small and now is obviously a big publisher.\r\n So from that perspective, in our core, if you do that type of math is growing double digits, which is good to see. So from that perspective, I'm happy and I'm happier even to see performance advertisers that are spending and migrating and getting good results.\r\n We spoke about that earlier today. So things are things are moving as we'd like to see. We're on track to complete the migration by midyear as we planned. And again, there's a lot of work ahead of us. So we're not taking it lightly. It's obviously ramping a big, a big partnership. But as of now, there's nothing new to share beyond the fact that we did the work and it's going as planned.\n\nJason Helfstein\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\r\n Justin Patterson, KeyBanc. Your line is open.\n\nJustin Patterson\n\nThanks for taking my question. This is Jacob on for Justin. With revenue from top brands agencies growth and 20% of revenue mark up, what efforts are driving the recent success you're seeing with these advertisers? And with the introduction of tubular Select, is there anything you can share in terms of early reception from these premium and advertisers and how you believe this expands the opportunity with us go to advertisers?\n\nStephen Walker\n\nYes. Thanks for the thanks for the question, Jacob. So what we can say is what's driving success for those advertisers? And why is our premium kind of brands and agencies business growing to above 20%?\r\n I think it's a combination of factors as with anything. It's not one thing. So Adam spoke earlier about the fact that we're seeing really good performance of MAX conversions and our high technology for those advertisers. So that's definitely a big part of it.\r\n So I think the financial advertiser that we talked about who came across and spent, I know a lot more than they even expected to because it was working so well for them. That's a big part of it like when the technology works, you get more budget, but we've also had a sales focus on this.\r\n So we have built out capabilities and teams that are specifically targeting and building relationships with major brands and agencies. And that's helping what we realized is that with the with the success we're seeing with the technology being that the state is we then announced two bullets select because we think we're at the right time and in the right position now to package everything together into an offering for these large brands and agencies that we think works really well.\r\n Technology works. We've got the right inventory, like if you think about the quality of our publisher inventory and what's happened to it over the last year, we've added Apple. We've added Yahoo. We've built our relationship with Microsoft Live.\r\n We have really, really high quality supply that has grown dramatically. We've got technology that's working for them. And now we've got the sales capability. So we decided to put it all together into an offering called two bullets select that we think is now at the right time and place to really succeed. So that's kind of how it all came together.\r\n So the success culture and technology, it comes from sales focus. It comes from the right having the right supply. And we're now at the right time and moment to really package together and go sell it aggressively.\n\nJustin Patterson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\r\n Mark Zgutowicz, Benchmark Company. Your line is now open for you guys.\n\nMark Zgutowicz\n\nThis is Alex on for Mark. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you perhaps quantify the e-commerce revenue ex tag penetration in 1Q and what you factored into your growth expectations throughout the year?\r\n As you lean into these new relationships? And then how should we be thinking about the extract margin accretion potential from this mix shift to e-commerce over the near and medium term? Thank you.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nSo we don't break out our e-commerce business specifically. So I'll give you kind of some flavor of what we have said historically. So first of all, what we've said is that e-commerce is growing faster than the rest of our business. So that's great, Mike. It's a growing part of our business. What's excited about that by the way is that e-commerce demand in particular is extremely high-quality.\r\n So it's coming from a combination of merchants like Walmart and Target and other people like that as well as from brands selling directly themselves like a Wayfair or a, um, Skechers or companies like that. So it is a we're showing really good momentum. It's exceeding the growth rate of the rest of our business and we expect that that's going to continue.\r\n So that's kind of what we've disclosed about e-commerce. Again, we haven't really disclosed how much of the breakout it is over time in terms of what's the opportunity to kind of grow X-Tack margins over time, especially especially relative to e-commerce?\r\n So first of all, what we've said is we expect to be at around 35% ex tax margin this year. That's kind of the midpoint of our guidance. We've said that we think that we have an opportunity to get that back up to 40% and beyond that over time.\r\n And part of that will be growth of e-commerce. E-commerce we report on a net basis. So it's highly accretive to our exact margins just because of that. But even beyond that, it's a really high value demand and helps us with our margins overall. So I think we do believe we have a good opportunity to grow our exact margins back above 40% over time and a part of that will be from e-commerce.\n\nMark Zgutowicz\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'm seeing no further questions. I would now like to hand the call back over to Adams Agoda.\n\nAdam Singolda\n\nThanks for joining us, everyone on the call today. And I hope you can say we're very happy with our strong start to the year. The key things that take away from the call today are one. Q1 showed a great momentum in the business, hitting the high end of our guidance, reiterating 2024, which makes this year a record year for us. Our growth rates are accelerating, which is great to see.\r\n And then our top two priorities are advertiser success and ramping Yahoo. Both are doing well. Apple News is now expanding our last quarter. It was in Australia and Canada. Now it's in the US and the UK and there's a lot going on a lot of work, but we're very happy with the strong momentum we have seen so far. I hope to see everyone soon, and thanks for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. For your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Judge grills Apple exec about whether company is defying order to enable more iPhone payment options",
        "content": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday questioned whether Apple has set up a gauntlet of exasperating hurdles to discourage the use of alternative payment options in iPhone apps, despite a court order seeking to create more ways for consumers to pay for digital services.\n\nThe verbal sparring between Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers and the head of Apple's app store kicked off a hearing focused on whether Apple is still steering U.S. consumers to its once-exclusive app payment system in defiance of an injunction aimed at promoting more choices that could help lower prices.\n\nGonzalez Rogers' order requires Apple to allow app developers to display links to other options besides the company's own payment system in the U.S. Apple makes billions of dollars annually from that setup, which imposes commission ranging from 15% to 30% on digital transactions completed within the most popular iPhone apps.\n\nApple's app store and its commission system also is being targeted in another antitrust case recently filed by the U.S. Justice Department in a case alleging the iPhone walls off competition in a variety of ways that stifle competition and innovation.\n\nGonzalez Rogers often sounded frustrated and skeptical as she periodically chimed in during four hours of testimony from Matthew Fischer, the Apple executive in charge of the iPhone app store.\n\nThe tone of the judge's questions indicated she is concerned Apple's efforts to comply with her order have been primarily designed to protect the company's profits instead of making it easier for iPhone users to switch to other in-app payment options, as she intended.\n\nGonzalez Rogers was particularly pointed as she grilled Fischer about whether Apple had deliberately made it more cumbersome and confusing for consumers to make digital purchases through alternative services.\n\n“Other than to stifle competition, I can see no other answer,” the judge said as she tried to dissect the rationale for Apple's design of alternative payment option system for iPhone apps.\n\nFischer maintained Apple is complying with the judge's order while still trying to shield iPhone users from bad actors on the internet and enabling the Cupertino, California, company to reap a return on its investments in the app store and other mobile software.\n\nToward that end, Apple has introduced a new commission structure ranging from 12% to 27% on digital transactions initiated from within an app and completed on an alternative payment option. After Gonzalez Rogers said it sounded like Apple was still collecting a “windfall,” Fischer said the company expected its effective commission rate on digital transactions processed by alternative payment options to be about 18%.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We are running a business,” Fischer said.\n\nApple spent more than two years trying to overturn the order that Gonzalez Rogers issued as part of a broader antitrust battle that the company won. The injunction requiring Apple to allow links to alternative app payments took effect in January after U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case.\n\nBut Fischer disclosed Wednesday that Apple so far has only received and approved applications to display links to alternative payment systems from 38 apps so far — a fraction of the roughly 2 million iPhone apps available in the U.S. Fischer couldn't specify how many of those apps engage in digital transactions when asked by Gonzalez Rogers, who ordered Apple to provide the number as the proceedings progress this month.\n\nVideo game Epic Games cites the muted interest in applying for in-app links to alternative payment options as evidence that Apple was still rigging the system in its favor.\n\nEpic, maker of the popular Fortnite video game, is trying to force Apple to make more sweeping changes to accommodate alternative payment options after it unsuccessfully tried to persuade Gonzalez Rogers that the iPhone app store had turned into a price-gouging monopoly during a 2021 trial.\n\nThe effort is being supported by Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms, Elon Musk’s X short-messaging service, music streaming service Spotify and long-time Apple rival Microsoft.\n\nApple’s current alternative payment formula “is guaranteed to continue extracting excessive commissions from developers” while also blocking them from steering consumers to other places where they could buy the same digital services for lower prices, Epic asserted in documents leading up to Wednesday’s hearing.\n\nIn its own pre-hearing briefs, Apple accused Epic of trying to get Gonzalez Rogers to micromanage its business in ways designed to boost the video game maker’s profits.\n\n“Epic has repeatedly made clear that what it wants is access to and use of Apple’s tools and technologies without having to pay for them,\" Apple argued.\n\nThe court hearings are scheduled to resume Friday when another top Apple executive, Phil Schiller, is expected to testify. Gonzalez Rogers hopes to wrap up the hearings by May 17, but told lawyers Wednesday it might take longer than that.\n\nView comments",

If the majority of the unionized employees votes May 11 to approve a strike, it could take place at any time. A union representative said no dates have been decided.\n\nThe local affiliate of the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers is scheduled on May 21 to hold its next round of negotiations on a contract with Apple. A strike in front of an Apple retail store would upset the finely tuned image of the company. It would also mark the first known walkout by unionized Apple retail workers in the US, but would follow one in France last year.\n\nThe union told employees it would provide $200 per week to the strikers after a walkout has gone on at least 14 days and that those who protest can’t be fired for picketing over labor practices. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe store and Apple have reached a series of agreements, none of which are considered to veer greatly from Apple’s preexisting policies. The union told employees there are ongoing negotiations regarding pay, overtime, unpaid leave of absences, time-away benefits and scheduling.\n\n“Our tentative agreements will bring remarkable protections to our team and achieve many of our goals going into bargaining,” the union told the Towson store workers. “Apple is not bargaining in good faith, and we have multiple unfair labor practice charges against Apple for their illegal behavior.”\n\nIn an unrelated development, the company’s store in Short Hills, New Jersey, is voting this weekend on whether to unionize. Earlier this month, the US National Labor Relations Board ruled that Apple illegally interrogated staff at its World Trade Center store in New York City.\n\n--With assistance from Josh Eidelson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags A New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jaspreet Singh\n\n(Reuters) - A group that represents audio streaming firms including Spotify and France's Deezer in Europe has urged the European Commission to reject Apple's proposal in a music streaming case.\n\nDigital Music Europe expressed concern in a letter submitted to the European Commission on Tuesday that Apple's proposal to comply with the regulator's March order, in which the iPhone-maker was fined 1.84 billion euros ($1.98 billion), does not provide concrete and effective remedies.\n\n\"Apple's new entitlement for music streaming services is a discriminatory program that forces competitors to opt into a new regime run by Apple,\" the letter added.\n\nApple was fined by the EU in March for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.\n\nSubsequently, the iPhone-maker announced measures to make it easier for music streaming apps on its App Store in the European Economic Area to inform users of other ways to purchase digital services, as it looks to comply with a European Union mandate.\n\nUnder Apple's proposal, streaming services can include links to their websites to inform users of payment options outside its App Store and the company would charge a 27% commission on transactions made through a link.\n\nApple said the developers can provide information about purchases available on their website to users through email as well.\n\nThe European Commission and the firms represented by Digital Music Europe, including Deezer, Qobuz and SoundCloud, Jamendo and Soundcharts did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Spotify declined to comment.\n\nLast month, Apple rejected Spotify's new version of iOS app with in-app pricing information for users in the European Union, as the streaming firm does not want to be a part of Apple's proposal.\n\n($1 = 0.9310 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still losing billions of dollars on the metaverse. In fact, in the company’s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent a good deal of time talking about how Meta loses money, including the $3.8 billion it lost on the metaverse. Still, Zuckerberg isn’t giving up on the metaverse just yet, which is creating opportunity for some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today.\n\nInstead, he’s now associating his metaverse plans with artificial intelligence. As noted by a LinkedIn.com article, “Zuckerberg believes that the integration of AI and the metaverse will revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other.”\n\nEven companies like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are selling “real world” goods in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) gaming environment, which is reigniting metaverse commerce, says ChainStoreAge.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“Walmart’s IRL commerce shop in its Roblox experience enables users to check out real world items chosen by its partner user generated content (UGC) creators. Walmart is adjusting its merchandising strategy to fit the metaverse, which by itself should make metaverse and retail observers sit up and take notice,” they added.\n\nIn short, don’t off the metaverse just yet. Instead, you may want to use weakness as an opportunity with some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today, such as:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best metaverse stocks to buy today is Roblox.\n\nFor one, after plummeting to a low of $33.71, Roblox is exploding higher. Last trading at $40.54, if it can break above double-top resistance, it could test $43 next.\n\nTwo, the company is opening a new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD). By doing so, advertisers will be able to reach more than half of its 71.5 million daily active users.\n\nThree, Roblox is also running on a JPMorgan upgrade, with a price target of $48.\n\n“The crux of our bull thesis is that we believe RBLX has a significant monetization opportunity ($0.06 per hour with 80% of hours not monetized) and [management’s] focus on margin leverage, which we expect to result in FCF compounding 40%+ through 2027,” said the firm, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s also the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse’s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to name a few of them.\n\nAt the moment, the ETF trades at just under $12.50, so I can spend about $1,250 for 100 shares. And I can diversify with the fund’s 38 holdings. Or, I can go out and just buy 100 shares of Nvidia and spend closer to $91,000.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $7 in late 2022, the ETF exploded to a recent high of $12.49. From here, if the metaverse story can gain traction, it could double, if not triple in value—with a good deal of patience. With the METV ETF, simply buy it, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown but not out, shares of Unity Software are sitting at strong support. In fact, if you pull up a two-year chart, you can see it’s holding and bouncing from the same support level for the seventh time since Nov. 2022. From its current price of $25.32, based on history, we’d like to see it retest around $35 a share.\n\nHelping, analysts at William Blair have a buy rating on the stock. Analysts at Wedbush have an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $33.50.\n\nAnd, as noted by Investorplace contributor Jeremy Flint, “Unity generates positive cash flow through a substantial advertising network.

        "title": "Apple’s iPad event was an AI teaser for its future",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) AI push has begun. On Tuesday, the company unveiled its latest iPad Pros packing an all-new M4 processor. The chip provides the Pro with a number of benefits including a faster CPU and updated graphics processing unit.\n\nBut it was Apple’s focus on the M4’s AI capabilities that stood out the most. Apple has been putting its neural engine into processors since 2017 and has previously talked up how it helps power a number of iPhone, iPad, and Mac features for some time.\n\nBut the M4 unveiling was different, serving as an appetizer for the AI features the company will serve up at its WWDC event in June, when Apple is widely expected to debut a slew of generative AI-powered software features for its various devices.\n\nThe M4 and AI\n\nApple pointed to a number of the M4’s AI bona fides during the keynote, with vice president of platform architecture Tim Millet specifically noting that the chip is capable of 34 trillion operations per second, a measurement commonly used when describing a chip’s AI performance.\n\nMillet also said that the M4’s neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC. That’s a direct shot at Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are preparing to or are already rolling out their own AI PC chips designed to run large language models on Windows laptops and desktops. Apple's M4 chip brings with it increased AI capabilities, which could tip what's to come at WWDC next month. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nOutside of the M4’s AI processing fundamentals, Apple was mum on any substantive discussion of AI software updates. Sure, Millet said that the M4 helps the iPad Pro quickly isolate a subject from its background in a 4K video, but the M2-equipped iPad Air can do the same thing, just a bit slower. All the company had to offer was that the M4 would make AI apps and features run faster and more smoothly.\n\nThe company also didn’t provide information about the M4’s performance while training or running large language models (LLMs), something that Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD regularly point to as indicators of their chips’ strengths.\n\nStill, the fact that Apple gave consumers, and Wall Street, an early look at its AI thinking is important.\n\nThe company is widely viewed as behind the curve when it comes to the generative AI race, and investors are banking heavily on WWDC serving as Apple’s big AI coming-out party.\n\nCEO Tim Cook has been steadily mentioning AI more over the past few months, and said during the company’s most recent earnings call that the iPhone maker is investing heavily in the technology.\n\nThat includes buying up smaller AI firms, and, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, holding talks with both OpenAI and Google about potentially using their large language models to power Apple’s AI experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expect Apple’s generative AI offerings to serve as a catalyst in helping to boost iPhone sales at a time when consumers are increasingly holding on to their phones longer and splashy new features differentiating one generation from another are in short supply.\n\nNow Apple just has to deliver.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Arm Holdings Plc is the most expensive stock among artificial intelligence hardware makers, despite trading nearly 30% below its peak. Wednesday’s earnings will need to offer bullish signals to justify that valuation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmericans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump’s Demeanor Trump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial US Pauses Arms Shipment to Israel on Rafah Invasion Concerns\n\nThe semiconductor designer, whose share price has more than doubled since its September initial public offering, may struggle to generate the kind of excitement that sent its stock soaring in February after a bumper revenue forecast — especially in an earnings season in which investors have been hard to impress.\n\n“People should temper their expectations as far as how well this will act with a positive result,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.\n\nThe options market is implying an 12% move in either direction for Arm shares following results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock, which is down as much as 2.1% on Wednesday, jumped 48% the day after earnings in February.\n\nThis earnings season has been good for AI-related companies able to show that their investments in computing gear will pay off. But investors have been quick to punish others, with Meta Platforms Inc. spooking equity markets last month when it revealed large AI spending plans, amid doubts over its revenue streams.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. also saw its shares fall after reporting quarterly sales that fell just short of estimates.\n\nRead More: AI Hardware Stocks Get Pummeled Even as Big Tech Keeps Spending\n\nThat suggests Arm will have to give results and forecasts that far surpass Wall Street estimates for the stock to avoid a similar fate. The company is expected to report sales of $879.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 39% from the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings are expected to be 30 cents per share, compared with break-even a year ago.\n\nAt 27 times sales projected over the next 12 months, Arm is more expensive than any stock in the Nasdaq 100. That includes Nvidia Corp., the biggest beneficiary of demand for AI computing hardware that’s seen its shares jump more than 500% since the end of 2022.\n\nMichael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management LLC, is betting that Arm can meet the hype. The high valuation is being exacerbated by the limited number of shares available to trade as a result of Softbank Group Corp.’s roughly 90% stake, according to Sansoterra.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It is an expensive stock, but it’s also a stock that’s expanding into new markets and growing quickly,” he said in an interview. “Anytime they get bought or sold, you’re going to see a slightly higher volatility in the shares because of that smaller float.”\n\nTop Tech News\n\nChinese iPhone shipments jumped about 12% in March after Apple Inc. and its retailers slashed prices, official data showed, suggesting efforts to arrest an accelerating decline in sales are yielding early results.\n\nApple unveiled a new artificial intelligence-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air, aiming to reinvigorate a tablet lineup that has languished over the past two years. SoftBank is in talks to acquire Graphcore Ltd., a struggling British semiconductor startup once valued at $2.8 billion, according to people familiar with the deals. The bounceback in Chinese stocks from their multi-year lows risks running out of steam unless the nation’s tech giants can deliver on their earnings next week. Steven Mnuchin, the former US Treasury Secretary, said he’s still interested in buying TikTok’s US operation from its Chinese owner, and believes the social media app’s critical video recommendation technology could be replicated.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nShopify Vishay Intertech Clear Secure SmartRent Valens Semiconductor Postmarket\n\nHubSpot AppLovin Amdocs MKS Instruments SolarEdge Instructure Jamf Holding SiTime IonQ Blend Labs Xperi Porch Group 8x8 Consensus Cloud LivePerson\n\n(Adds Wednesday trading in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags A New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Loses Another Top Designer, Extending Post-Jony Ive Exodus",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The exodus is now nearly complete for the Apple Inc. design group that worked under Jony Ive, a legendary team that helped the company pioneer music players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAmericans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track Trump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial One Out of Every 24 New York City Residents Is Now a Millionaire FTX Has Billions More Than Needed to Pay Bankruptcy Victims\n\nDuncan Kerr, one of Ive’s few remaining design colleagues at the company, has informed Apple that he’s leaving soon, according to people who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public. Kerr joined the company in 1999 and was instrumental to developing several generations of the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nA spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nWith the departure, Ive’s team of about two dozen closely knit employees has been almost entirely dissolved. In the years following Ive’s own exit in 2019, top designers like Jody Akana, Joe Tan, Anthony Ashcroft, Andrea Williams, Jeremy Bataillou and Eugene Whang left. The outflow continued over the past year, with major players like Bart Andre, Colin Burns, Shota Aoyagi and Peter Russell-Clarke departing as well.\n\nEvans Hankey, Ive’s successor as Apple’s head of industrial design, left Apple last year. Alan Dye, the company’s chief of interface design, remains in place, but his team has also lost several members in recent months. The last remaining industrial designers from the Ive era are Richard Howarth, Molly Anderson and Ben Shaffer.\n\nA large portion of the team at Apple has left for LoveFrom, Ive’s new design company. The firm is working on projects with Airbnb Inc., Ferrari NV, Moncler SpA and other brands. Ive has remained out of the Apple spotlight in recent years but participated in a joint interview with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Laurene Powell Jobs in 2022.\n\nOver the past year and a half, Apple’s team of designers has reported directly to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams. That has irked some of the artists and sculptors, who were used to working closely with a manager from the design world. The brain drain of Apple designers after Ive’s departure led to Apple being unable to replace Hankey directly, Bloomberg News reported at the time.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Uniqlo’s ‘Millennial Birkin’ Is Beating Designer Bags A New Kind of Power Company Will Put a Battery in Every Home Tesla Pulls the Plug on Supercharger The Company Preaching America’s Nuclear Revival Boom Times Are Over for Food Startups, But That’s a Good Thing\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple AAPL, during a virtual launch event, unveiled a new lineup of iPads for the first time in two years. The tech giant launched two new versions of its top-end iPad Pro models and two new versions of its mid-tier iPad Air. It also debuted the Apple Pencil Pro stylus and an updated Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Pro line. The new models are expected to hit stores next week and are expected to drive global tablet market share.\r\n\r\nThat said, ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan are in focus. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Invesco QQQ QQQ have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nInsights Into the New Models\n\nThe two new iPad Pro models are the thinnest products ever (5.1 mm) and come with an M4 processor, Ultra Retina XDR display and AI. This is the “biggest update ever” to iPad Pro. The M4 chipset has been introduced for the first time by Apple. The 11-inch model costs $999, while the 13-inch model is priced at $1,299.\r\n\r\nThe company said the iPad Pro could be a useful tool for professional video producers and announced a new app called Final Cut Camera that can control multiple iPhone cameras. The iPad Pro comes with a 12-megapixel rear camera that can record 4K video, according to Apple.\r\n\r\nThe iPad Pro also offers support for a bunch of accessories, including the new Apple Pencil Pro, priced at $129 and Magic Keyboard, which is available at $299 for the 11-inch model and at $329 for the 13-inch model.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the new models of iPad Air, the mid-range tablet, are available in two sizes. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599 for 128GB of storage, while the 13-inch version starts at $799.  Apple has moved the front-facing camera to the longer side of the device — landscape mode — to improve videoconferencing, matching the more expensive iPad Pro models. The iPad Air comes in a variety of colors, including blue, purple and gold.\r\n\r\nAll the new models are 50% faster than the previous generation and 10 times faster than the original iPad Pro or iPad Pro models. The new devices will help to bolster Apple‘s struggling tablet division and provide stiff competition to Samsung and OnePlus. The tech giant’s iPad sales declined 17% to $5.6 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2024 (read: ETFs to Buy on Apple's Q2 Earnings Beat, Largest-Ever Buyback).\n\nSolid Fundamentals\n\nApple boasts the world’s highest stock market valuation, at nearly $2.8 trillion. It has seen a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny for the current fiscal year (ending September 2024) but a positive estimate revision of 8 cents for the next fiscal over the past 30 days. The iPhone maker has an estimated earnings growth rate of 6.62% for this fiscal year, higher than the industry average growth of 4.60%.\r\n\r\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.82 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.\r\n\r\nOf the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 56.67% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.\r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 29 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.23. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock is cheap, trading at a P/E ratio of 27.80 compared with Amazon’s (AMZN) 41.56 times, Netflix’s (NFLX) 32.62 times and Microsoft’s (MSFT) 35.16 times  (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK): Apple accounts for 20.8% share\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT): Apple accounts for a 15.4% share.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC): Apple makes up 15.4% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW): Apple makes up 15.6% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (IWY): Apple accounts for 11.5% share.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple's New M4 iPads: 'More Powerful Than Any AI PC' Today, Set To Boost Sales",
        "content": "Apple's New M4 iPads: 'More Powerful Than Any AI PC' Today, Set To Boost Sales\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced the launch of its latest iPad models: the iPad Pro equipped with the powerful M4 chip and OLED displays, and the iPad Air now featuring the M2 chip.\n\nThese introductions mark the first update to the iPad lineup since October 2022, signaling a significant step in Apple’s product evolution, and are expected to improve the revenue mix and drive growth going forward, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nKey Insights from the New iPad Launch\n\nGoldman Sachs equity analyst Michael Ng highlighted several critical aspects of the new iPad releases that investors should note:\n\nSupport for Revenue Growth: “The introduction of the new iPad models aligns with Apple’s forecast for F3Q24E, which anticipates double-digit year-over-year growth in iPad revenue,” Ng stated. This growth is supported by clean iPad channel inventory, thanks to strategic efforts to clear out older models before the new releases. This move is particularly expected to bolster revenue trends in Greater China. Advancements in AI and Processing Power: The new iPad Pro features Apple's latest M4 chip, which is described as “more powerful than any AI PC NPU today.” The M4 chip's Neural Engine can process up to 38 trillion operations per second, outpacing any current AI PC neural processing unit. This enhancement underscores Apple’s ability to handle on-device AI workloads across its product lines, including the iPhone and Mac, without needing additional upgrades. Potential for Improved Price and Product Mix: The new lineup introduces a larger variety of sizes and prices, particularly for the iPad Air, which is now available in 11-inch and 13-inch models. This change is significant as “half of the iPad Pro users purchase the larger screen size,” presenting a clear opportunity to improve the price and product mix. The iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model and $1,299 for the 13-inch model, showing a price increase compared to the previous models from October 2022. Even with increased starting storage (256GB versus 128GB), there remains a roughly $100 price hike, normalized for this change. Additional Product Updates: Alongside the iPads, Apple announced new models of the Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil. The Magic Keyboard, priced at $299 for the 11-inch and $349 for the 13-inch, includes a larger trackpad, a USB-C port, and a functional top row. The Apple Pencil Pro, at $129, is compatible with both the new iPad Air and iPad Pro, introducing features like squeeze, barrel roll, and haptic feedback. These are the first updates to the Smart Keyboard since 2019 and the Apple Pencil since 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead also: Apple’s iPads Playing Crucial Role In Russia-Ukraine War: Kyiv Is Using Them To Control Western Weapons, Says US Defense Undersecretary\n\nGoldman Sachs’ Outlook on Apple\n\nGoldman Sachs has reiterated a Buy rating on Apple with a 12-month target price of $226, implying a potential 25% increase from current levels.\n\nAccording to Ng, while the market is concerned about slower product revenue growth, “the strength of Apple’s ecosystem and the visibility of its revenue streams should offset these worries.”\n\nFactors like Apple’s growing installed base, the secular growth in services, and continuous product innovation are expected to balance out the cyclical challenges in product revenue, including the longer iPhone replacement cycle and softer demand in the PC and tablet markets.\n\nNew Apple’s iPads: Detailed Pricing and Specifications\n\nBelow is a comprehensive look at the new models, their specifications, and pricing:\n\nModel Display Size (in) Other specs Release Date Storage (GB) Launch Price (USD) iPad Pro (7th-gen, WiFi only) 12.9 5/15/2024 256 $1,299 12.9 5/15/2024 512 $1,499 12.9 5/15/2024 1000 $1,899 12.9 5/15/2024 2000 $2,299 12.9 Nano-texture glass 5/15/2024 1000 $1,999 12.9 Nano-texture glass 5/15/2024 2000 $2,399 iPad Pro (7th-gen, WiFi + Cellular) 12.9 5/15/2024 256 $1,499 12.9 5/15/2024 512 $1,699 12.9 5/15/2024 1000 $2,099 12.9 5/15/2024 2000 $2,499 12.9 Nano-texture glass 5/15/2024 1000 $2,199 12.9 Nano-texture glass 5/15/2024 2000 $2,599 iPad Air (WiFi only) 10.9 5/15/2024 $599 10.9 5/15/2024 $699 10.9 5/15/2024 $899 10.9 5/15/2024 $1,099 iPad Air (WiFi + Cellular) 10.9 5/15/2024 $749 10.9 5/15/2024 $849 10.9 5/15/2024 $1,049 10.9 5/15/2024 $1,249 iPad Air (larger model, WiFi only) 12.9 5/15/2024 $799 12.9 5/15/2024 $899 12.9 5/15/2024 $1,099 12.9 5/15/2024 $1,299 iPad Air (larger model, WiFi + Cellular) 12.9 5/15/2024 $949 12.9 5/15/2024 $1,049 12.9 5/15/2024 $1,249 12.9 5/15/2024 $1,449\n\nRead now: Tim Cook Kicked Off iPad Event By Hyping Up Apple Vision Pro, Top Analyst Says It’s ‘Just A Reminder’ While Jim Cramer Says ‘It’s Not A Bust’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for AAPL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Equal-Weight Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Strong Buy Jan 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple's New M4 iPads: 'More Powerful Than Any AI PC' Today, Set To Boost Sales originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Apple is a formidable opponent. That hasn’t stopped this CEO from suing the tech giant",
        "content": "On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, Michal Lev-Ram talks to Joe Kiani, founder, chairman and CEO of Masimo, a medical devices company, about the massive challenges he's facing: his company's patent infringement suit against Apple and a proxy battle being waged by Masimo shareholders who are agitating for a change in management.\n\nWhy did Kiani decide to take on the tech giant in court? He says that Apple recruited Masimo's CTO as well as 25 other employees and then infringed \"our IP...and a lot of our trade secrets are now at Apple.\" Kiani adds: \"Given that we were going forward with our consumer plan, we didn't want to be competing with our own technology.\"\n\nLev-Ram and Kiani also discuss how AI will change health care, leading during challenging time, and the CEO's own origin story which includes starting college when he was just 15. \"My math was really good,\" says Kiani. Co-host Alan Murray was off this week.\n\nNote about this week's episode: Apple continues to deny Masimo’s IP claims. Additionally, Apple defended its standards for suppliers, telling Fortune it conducted thousands of assessments and audits last year to ensure healthy labor practices. Apple disputes Kiani's characterization of its App Store commissions.\n\nListen to the episode or read the transcript below.\n\nTranscript\n\nMichal Lev-Ram: Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing world of business leadership. I'm Michal Lev-Ram.\n\nToday I am flying solo. Alan Murray could not make it, my co-host, but on today's episode, really fascinating conversation. I talked to Joe Kiani. He's the founder and CEO of a company you may not have heard about, but it's called Masimo, and it's a medical device company. More specifically, they make patient monitoring devices. And while it's been a relatively quiet company, a little bit under the radar unless you're in that industry, they made a lot of noise more recently because they went up against a much, much bigger corporation, Apple, in a patent infringement case, which has been pretty complicated.\n\nBut Kiani has got a lot of other complications on his hands internally as well. There has been a proxy battle waged by some shareholders who are agitating for change at the company and change in its management. And this has really been a tumultuous period. He's the founder of the company as well. So, he's been running it for quite a long time, for several decades. He really kind of bet the company on this legal battle with Apple. And yet he seems pretty calm, as you'll see in the conversation.\n\nStory continues\n\nI was really struck by how openly he spoke about both the Apple controversy and legal battle and, of course, the proxy battle that he's dealing with internally, because a lot of CEOs do not want to talk about these topics—but a lot of them are dealing with this. And he's got some strong feelings about both, as calm as he is. So without further ado, here is my conversation with Joe Kiani, the CEO of Masimo.\n\n[Music plays. Interview begins.]\n\nJoe, thank you so much for joining us on the podcast. I want to start out by just having you tell us a little bit about the company, about Masimo, and just why you started it and what you guys do.\n\nJoe Kiani: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be on your program, Michal. I started Masimo in 1989 in my condominium that had an attached garage, so I guess it was a real garage startup. I had just gotten my Masters in the area of adaptive filters and AI signal processing. And before starting Masimo, I had a consulting job where I was working for another company to make a low cost pulse oximeter. At the time, pulse oximeters were several thousand dollars. They wanted $100 ones.\n\nLev-Ram: And Joe, I'm stopping you for a second because for those who don't know, what is a pulse oximeter?\n\nKiani: A pulse oximeter is the non-invasive measurement of arterial blood, oxygen saturation and pulse rate. It uses the physics of Beer-Lambert law to shine light through the tissue. With the light that comes through or gets reflected, we can tell based on the absorption of light, those particular frequencies, if you're highly oxygenated or your oxygen is dropping. So it looks at changes of color and blood. It's become pretty popular during COVID because, as you remember, one of the signs of COVID was they called hypoxemia, where someone could be at 92 percent where they normally should be about 90 to 100 percent. Yeah, it’s ubiquitous in hospitals.\n\nLev-Ram: Great. Okay. And back to the origin story.\n\nKiani: While I was trying to develop this cheap pulse oximeter for them, I realized what I moved with the probe on my finger, my oxygen saturation would go from a 98 to 100 percent, 70 or 60 percent. And I knew my physiology hadn't changed. It was just a slow motion of my hand, and I have low perfusion of cold hands so that really exacerbated the problem. Or maybe if I had warm hands I would've never noticed the problem. But I set out to solve that problem. I knew about a class of filters known as adaptive filters that could figure out what frequencies to let in and what frequencies to block, kind of like your noise canceling headphones. And I thought I could use that to get rid of this end band noise where my motion was the same bandwidth as the signal we were looking for.\n\nLev-Ram: Okay.\n\nKiani: So that's the beginning. I took a $40,000 loan on my condominium, and then friends and family invested another $80,000 several months later. And with that we created Masimo. Today we're a publicly-traded company with nearly $2 billion in revenue and about 10,000 employees.\n\nLev-Ram: And tell me about how the product itself or the products have evolved over time.\n\nKiani: Well, when we started, I didn't realize the industry had tried to solve this problem but couldn't. They thought it was just inherent limitation in the pulse oximetry that the motion would cause errors. Up until then, also, even though pulse oximeters were becoming ubiquitous in hospitals, they were fraught with false alarms. It was being reported that 70 to 90 percent of the alarms are false due to motion artifact and low perfusion and large studies like one that was done in the Netherlands with 10,000 patients with, 10,000 patients without a pulse oximetry showed no difference in outcomes.\n\nSo when you ask what has become of this, by solving this problem we really turned it into a clinically-useful tool to the point that not only has it been proven to reduce retinopathy of prematurity in neonates—about 12 percent of babies in the neonatal ICUs were getting severe eye damage [and] in the U.S. alone, 2,000 babies were going blind—that's virtually eliminated now. Great technology. Secondly, newborns that were being sent home sometimes with critical congenital heart defect, about 0.8 percent of the time, we now can detect that with the accuracy we have with our pulse oximeters by looking at pre-ductal post-ductal difference, and if it's more than 3 percent, we know something's wrong with the heart.\n\nAnd most maybe something I did predict, I didn't predict solving these two problems when I started Masimo, I did hope once we solved the problem we could help save lives of patients on opioids because a lot of people were getting opioids to reduce their pain in the hospital. But when the nurse would come back to check in on them, they were found dead in bed. And when they try to put pulse oximetry on these patients, the false alarm rates were so high they couldn't deal with it. But because we got rid of the false alarms, a ten-year study has just come out from Dartmouth-Hitchcock that showed the group that we were on, no more dead in bed, no more brain damage versus the group without our technology there were people who died of opioid overdose. But they also saved $7 million a year by reducing patients being transferred back into the ICU and rapid response team activation. So, our technology has had a real impact, a real clinical outcome. And today over 200 million people are monitored with our technology every year. So it's really making a huge difference worldwide.\n\nLev-Ram: Are you selling into hospitals, medical centers exclusively or is there a consumer angle here, too?\n\nKiani: We had been selling exclusively to hospitals, but a few years ago we began selling it into the home when COVID occurred. We were working on a project called Opioid Halo, which would help people at home detect opioid overdose, whether it was for illicit use or prescription use. But, so, it was a device that was a wearable. It would connect to your smartphone, it would go to the cloud, would alert your family or friends, and if they wouldn't respond, it would alert the ambulance nearest you with your location to come rescue you. That product, by the way, just got FDA approval last year, in the last year. But during COVID, we went to the FDA saying we could use this to let hospitals send patients home with COVID that did not need ICU care and bring them only when they need ICU care. And they cleared that product within a week. We tested at the two major institutions. Once we fine-tuned it, we put it out hundreds of hospitals deployed it. They showed it reduced mortality by 70 percent and reduced the cost per patient by 11,000. So, yeah, so that became our kind of a way to get to consumers and since then we've developed this product, the W1, which is a wearable that does the same thing on your wrist, continuous SpO2, continuous pulse rate, and even hydration index. And we just got FDA clearance for that in the last year too.\n\nLev-Ram: Okay. So since we've segued into consumer wearables, I'm going to ask you the Apple question, or I have a few questions, I should say. You have this very calm disposition, but I know your company, you and your company have come up against some pretty significant challenges. And I want to hear again, a little bit of an origin story of just the legal battle with Apple and how that started. Take us back if you don't mind.\n\nKiani: Sure. When Steve Jobs died, I remember picking up his biography and I couldn't put it down. I got enamored with and I even saw how he criticized how his monitors at the Memphis hospital were so bad and how he wanted to do something about it. Right around that time, we introduced a product called iSpO2, which was the first pulse oximeter for the smartphones. A few months later, we got a call from Apple saying, Hey, we want to meet with you. You guys are the platinum of non-invasive monitoring and we'll sign an NDA. Come tell us everything. We want to work with you. So I was excited. I really wanted to work with Apple and I went there personally with a couple of my team members and spent half a day with them. The meeting went really well and I thought we're going to work together. But unfortunately a few months later I learned that they're trying to recruit my team. I got a call from my chief medical officer saying, Joe, I'm sorry, I'm leaving to go to Apple. I couldn't refuse it. They gave me, he said I think, $5 million in RSUs, doubled my salary, doubled my bonus. This is my retirement. I got to go. But he assured me, no, we're not looking at doing pulse oximetry. We want to work with Masimo still. This should actually bring us closer. Well, it didn't stop there, unfortunately. I want to fast forward a bit. They ended up taking 25 of my team members, our CTO. And you know, the rule is in California is you can't assume they're going to do something bad. You have to wait till they do it before you can do something about it. And you can’t rely on what is called inevitable disclosure. And this friend of mine who went to Apple kept assuring me that we're not working on pulse ox. No one cares about pulse oximetry, so don't worry about it.\n\nWell, fast forward to 2019, I saw six patents issued to Apple, all on pulse oximetry, all with our chief technical officer that used to work for our sister company, Willow Cercacor. And one of the disclosures, well all of them were on our stuff. One of them was a trade secret, it wasn’t even something we had patented. So at that point we decided to sue them for trade secret and later patent infringement. And during the trial, the trade secret trial, ended up at a hung jury, which we get to retry end of this year, I learned the other side of the story.\n\nSo, Apple in 2012 decided to make the watch. They thought the most important feature of the watch was pulse oximetry. They tried to do it themselves. They couldn't. This was all in their own internal document. They created a project called Rover to see who in the world knows pulse oximetry. About 50 companies were identified and individuals and in that document they said there are two standout companies, Masimo and Cercacor, both run by the same guy, Joe Kiani. And then they began saying all nice things about Joe is the Steve Jobs of the health care industry. He's not hirable, but he'd be the right guy to run our health care business. We should buy his company just to get him, let alone the cash flow, let alone everything else that comes with that. So they go to Tim Cook and they recommend they buy Masimo. Tim Cook says, No, that's not how we do things. Go do, what is it called? Smart recruitment or I forget what is the terminology he used. So they created a project called Everest to try to get my team to try see if they can do a JV with us. And then when they got our CTO, they decided they don't need us anymore. And then they created a new project under Steve Hotelling to recruit every engineer, every director at Masimo. Fortunately, not everybody was for paid for, but about 25 people did go. So here we have a situation that not only I’ve got infringement of our IP, but it's done by my team at Apple, and a lot of our trade secrets are now at Apple. So we, fortunately the, I can't say it's a happy ending because we're not done done yet, but we got a win, a major win at the ITC. Apple's watches with pulse oximetry were enjoined in the US and they're appealing it. I don't think they're going to win the appeal. We have a really strong case but we're waiting for that That's probably about a year away. But there's still couple of trials left to go and hopefully we'll ultimately get our justice.\n\nLev-Ram: So I'm curious, you know, we've obviously seen some other pretty high-profile cases of slightly smaller companies going up against Apple. More on the, you know, the App Store side and some of what we've seen there. It can't be a decision that you make lightly to go against such a humongous and beloved company. Talk us through kind of the process of why you made this decision or was it just a no brainer? You saw that there was, you know, in your words, infringement and you had to act.\n\nKiani: Yeah, it really was a no brainer. We're an innovation company. We didn't get to become who we are by just having great stores or great distribution. It's all about our intellectual property and what we bring out. Given that we were going forward with our consumer plan, we didn't want to be competing with our own technology. And Apple's had, like you said, one of the most formidable companies in the world and I think less beloved now but yeah, quite beloved. I used to love the company, too.\n\nLev-Ram: I'm guessing your affiliation has changed a little bit. Yeah.\n\nKiani: Yeah. Let's just say I don’t buy Apple products anymore and better, better off. I love my Android phone and Dell computers or whatever, but. But I got to tell you, there is an issue with Apple. Apple, unfortunately, doesn't just do this to Masimo, as you said they do to a lot of companies. In fact, there's a term for it I think in Silicon Valley, they call it Sherlocking. It was based on a company, I think, that was called Watson. They saw it, they liked it, and they Sherlocked it by creating their own version. But this happens over and over again. When Apple likes something, they just take it. They think no one's going to touch them. But that greed isn't just there with taking people's IP, it's where they manufacture the product, the conditions under which the people that work for Apple in China are treated where they have to put safety nets outside their buildings so people can't successfully commit suicide. So instead of improving the work conditions, they put a safety net out there. And you've seen the Apple Store, the App Store, how it went from 5 percent commission to 30 percent commission, the DOJ case, where they mess up other people's products so they can sell more of theirs. So it's just a I think, a systemic problem and I hope eventually the board of Apple wakes up and says we can't continue running this way. This is not sustainable. And they give leadership the direction to take different, act different.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, and to just to be fair, we have seen similar suits and issues with other large tech companies. So just, you know, wanted to put that out there. But I want to ask you…\n\nKiani: They’re in a bad neighborhood. I get it.\n\nLev-Ram: I, look, there are different outcomes to some of these lawsuits, obviously. But there are we're seeing quite a few of that more and more, right?\n\nKiani: Yeah.\n\nLev-Ram: And it's not an entirely new phenomenon either. It just seems like there's a lot more happening faster now, which actually is probably partly because innovation is happening so fast and you have to move so fast to keep up with it, especially these larger tech companies. So I want to ask you, what is it like today? I mean, I'm assuming that there's been a lot of progress, including the kind of emergence of more and more AI built into some of these products. What do you see as the most exciting advances that are going to impact your world today? What are you currently working on?\n\nKiani: Look, AI has been around for many years. I studied it while I was in college and but it's become very useful for a multitude of reasons. One, the ubiquity of video cameras and sensors, the high processing power of some of these chips that allow you to do things in real time. So yeah, I think the world of AI, we began deploying it about 15 years ago in a product called Halo, where we collect all the data on each patient from the vital signs, the electronic medical records data, labs, imaging, and we try to help clinicians figure out where the patient is now and where they're likely to go. Are they likely to be getting sepsis? Are they likely to be having heart failure [or] opioid overdose? So I think AI we’re just at the beginning of it really helping assist humanity in making better decisions and living hopefully better lives. So that's definitely one of them.\n\nThe other part I think that's really helping this whole internet age where you've got gigabits per second speed at homes now. I remember when I was in hotels at 19.2 kilobits per second modems trying to connect and how hard it was. Now you have at homes, people are all on Wi-Fi and if that's not working, it switches to cell. So that seamless and continuous stream of connectivity allows people now to not just be where the technology is, they can be wherever they are and the technology can be where they are. And we're excited. We think the 22nd-century health care doesn't have to wait 100 years. I think it could be here the next few years or people can get better care at home, stay home longer, come back home sooner. Yeah, so it's an exciting time.\n\nLev-Ram: So tell us a little bit more about you and kind of your journey pre-Masimo because you have such an interesting story and in some ways, you know, just quintessential immigrant American dream story. So, your own origin story.\n\nKiani: Wow. I was born in Shiraz, Iran. That's the city of poetry and wine. You wouldn’t know it these days with the mullahs running the place.\n\nLev-Ram: Not a lot of wine flowing these days.\n\nKiani: Not a lot of wine. I have heard behind the scenes there’s a lot of wine flowing. It's like the abolition time in Iran right now. There's more partying inside than before. But I got to tell you, I left the country that I loved. It was painful to come to the U.S. It took me months to get used to it. I came here knowing three words. I was nine years old. I came with my dad, mom, and left my friends behind. But six months later I was really into this place and loving it. We lived in Alabama. You know, we came as a middle class family, but we lived really poor life in Alabama and the U.S., I guess student family. We lived in the projects for a while. But everything was just shiny and beautiful to me. The woods, the creeks. In ’77, my parents moved to California. And what a what a change that was. People in Alabama were amazing. They literally threw us a party when we, the city in the city hall when we arrived there.\n\nLev-Ram: Wow.\n\nKiani: Yeah. They held special classes after school to help teach us English, and they invited my mom to come if she wanted to. She did to learn English. So kind, beautiful people. But most people there had not left that town their entire life, 60-mile radius was the extent of it. Housing was like $25,000 here. And then cut to California everyone's like everywhere, and the housing is off the charts. Proposition 13.\n\nAnyway, I, I went to high school in eventually California, had a wonderful time in a little town called El Cajon. I went to San Diego State University. I began there at age 15.\n\nLev-Ram: Age 15? Wow.\n\nKiani: Yeah, yeah. My math was really good. I came, so I kind of cheated. I came at fifth grade, but my math was almost like a senior-level math, so that helped me skip two or three grades. And I began college at 15 and became an electrical engineer. Got my masters. Then you heard the beginning when I started Masimo in 1989.\n\nLev-Ram: So I want to ask you, what's your philosophy been on and your strategy for innovating from within and also making acquisitions and partnerships? How would you characterize that?\n\nKiani: Well, I think, you know, we don't have a monopoly on great ideas, so we are always looking for other people with great technologies, great ideas that we can hopefully bring in to our team. We've done probably like, before the large acquisition we did, we probably have done about 10, 11 acquisitions of technologies that we thought were going to be helpful to where we're going and they've all been really successful. The fundamental technologies, most of them have come from within, and that's because we think the really hard problems are the right problems to solve and a lot of people leave those hard problems alone. And yeah, so I guess we can say we've done a bit of a hybrid. But SET pulse oximetry that we talked about, rainbow pulse co-oximetry, hospital automation, telehealth, it's all been done internally, but we brought other pieces of technologies like there’s one I'm really excited about, a company we acquired, called Nura had this adaptive acoustic technology that we want to use to make hearing aids and better ways to let people who have lost some of their hearing listen to music. That's a company we acquired.\n\nLev-Ram: So this is separate from Sound United, right? Separate acquisition.\n\nKiani: Yes.\n\nLev-Ram: Okay. So tell me and I know there's again, going back to some of the challenges and there's this ongoing proxy battle now which we can get into. I'm sure you love this topic. But tell me first about the acquisition, because it's a really interesting one for you guys. I mean, audio in general, which you just talked about, I think would surprise some people. But how did the acquisition come about for Sound United?\n\nKiani: Well, we've been working on our wearables and the hearables for many, many years, maybe 15 years as it was emerging, ready to come out. We tried to create our own team, president of consumer business, sales force, and it was daunting, slow. And finally, one of our board members, Julie Shimer, she said, Joe, if you really are serious about these products, you're going to have to acquire a company that's already in the consumer space. It’s a different world. And she had run Motorola's cell phone business and had been also the health care running, Welch Allyn’s health care business. So, I thought she was right and we began looking at many companies in the consumer space.\n\nWe ended up buying Sound United because it had not only some of the features we were looking for, a team that had a focus on sales and marketing to consumers, about three or 400 people. An engineering team that was really good at audio. We were getting into the hearables, so we wanted that. But they also had relationships across the world with retailers in the consumer space like Best Buy, and we said, okay, those really are what we need as we get ready to launch this product we call Freedom, our hearable devices like the one I'm wearing. But they also brought things that I wasn't looking for, but I was really excited about that, something called HEOS. And as we were getting into the home, I loved HEOS because they had like 4 million speakers and AVRs that had Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that then we could turn into health hubs. So as you're walking through your home, you don't have to be next to one hub you bought from us or your cell phone. Each room you went to, you could connect to and send your data to our medical cloud. So those were the reasons we acquired them and we ended up buying them for about one time revenue with positive cash flow. It was non-dilutive from day one and we love some of the products they had. There were iconic brands, high-end brands that we thought would sustain for maybe a century if needed to.\n\nLev-Ram: So, your shareholders weren't as enthusiastic about this acquisition. Did that catch you by surprise? What did you make of it?\n\nKiani: It did. It did, because I'm not new to this. We're celebrating our 35th anniversary, and it's not the first time I've took on a giant and we beat them and we won. So I believed my track record would put them at ease that I haven't lost my mind. There's a new large opportunity. We're going to go from a $10 billion TAM total available market to a $150 billion TAM, and with good reasons why we should be a major player in those spaces. Continuous monitoring. Why do people buy these wearables? Most of the time they're buying it for the health sensing, and there's about a third of the population that buy these smartwatches that have chronic illnesses.\n\nSo I thought once we explained where we're going and I knew we're going to consumer space and they understood why we bought it, they would appreciate it. Unfortunately. Yeah, you're right. They did not. I think I learned the hard way that while we have some shareholders that may have been with us for a decade, they make that decision on an annual basis. It's not like they decide they're going to be in it for ten years. If it keeps raising, the price goes up on the stock 10 or 15 percent a year, they're happy and they keep staying in their stock. They didn't want to take a step back to jump ten steps forward. So I think there's a mismatch. I run Masimo as though it's going to be around another 100 years and I need to figure out how to make sure it's there a 100 years from now. And I think our investors invest in Masimo thinking about the year ahead. And that kind of took them, I think, out of that mode because they knew there would be some investment period before we would come out with great results.\n\nLev-Ram: Would it be maybe this is an obvious question, but would it be easier making this kind of move if you were a privately held company today?\n\nKiani: Yeah. Yes. Well, let's just say I started to learn the perils of being a public company, and I unfortunately can't go back on that. But we did just recently announce that we're going to separate the consumer business, not just the audio Sound United, but the hearables, the wearables, all the consumer stuff that we want to get into into a new company. And that either will be a spin, which will be a public company again, which has its own problems, but at least people know what it's trying to do and they can't say they're surprised by where it's going. Or we're talking to one entity where we might do a JV, where Masimo shareholders make all 19 percent of bid so they have a ticket to hopefully, if it becomes really big, there's something there for them, but we don't have to consolidated in our financials, so they don't have to worry about it being a drag on our financials on the health care side. And that might be a good path too. So we're looking at our options and hopefully the next several months we'll have a new way of doing things.\n\nLev-Ram: I think we alluded to this before, but you're involved currently in a, there's a proxy battle brewing sort of as a result from this acquisition. I mean, do you regret making the acquisition or do you still think it was the right move? You know, again, like you said, with a kind of long-term vision for the company?\n\nKiani: No, I don't regret it. Despite all of the problems, headaches that has brought me, I would have regretted had I not tried to do this. This is the right thing to do. Literally it's going to make people's lives better. It's going to help people live longer, live healthier lives, and I think whether it's part of the new split business or it was part of Masimo, it could turn Masimo from a 10, $20 billion market cap company to hundreds of billions dollars and market cap. But it requires patience. It requires a long-term view. No, I don't regret it. I wish I had the support of our shareholders. I think I'd earned it. Many of them do support it. Many of them thanked me for it. Because it's easy once you become a market leader to just kind of go golfing and have fun. It's harder to work as though you're a startup still, so not everyone didn't like it, a lot of them did, but unfortunately there's a few large shareholders that own big pieces of Masimo that don't like it, and that looks, that makes it look like the majority of people don't like it.\n\nLev-Ram: So obviously you are not the only CEO who's dealing with a proxy battle. You're not the only CEO who's dealing with, you know, an infringement case and some of the legal challenges that you've had there. How do you as a leader and this is, this company is you know, it's your baby, right? How do you think that these challenges have changed you as a leader? And how do you keep not only grounded but also constantly evolving because you are in, you know, a space that's so where there is so much innovation happening, you're leading so much of it. How are you doing that in the midst of these challenges?\n\nKiani: That's a really good question. Last year during the proxy battle, I got so enamored in that process that I took my eyes off running Masimo. I let other people do it, great people, but they didn't have the benefit of my eyes on it. And, you know, we had a couple of hiccups, and I don't want to do that again. So one thing for sure, going forward, my job isn’t to win the proxy battle. My job is to run Masimo while I'm its CEO, its chairman, and the shareholders can decide what they want to do. So I'm going to do that differently. It has made me become more, I think more spiritual is the wrong word, but I've kind of looked into myself of why am I doing what I'm doing? What am I really here to do? And realize, you know what? As beautiful, this Masimo headquarters is, as amazing as everything I've built today is, at the end of the day, I'm a man with a mission. I'm a man with passion. And I want to do what I want to do. But if I can't do it, you know, there’s other things. I'm not defined by what I created over the last 35 years.\n\nLev-Ram: So you mentioned that as much as Masimo is a part of you, it doesn't completely define you. What else does and what do you see ahead for you?\n\nKiani: Well, first of all, I think we're all so fortunate to be surrounded by nature. I mean what a blessing. All these creatures, animals, birds, everything is. And to to recognize the small things around us, it really is important. But probably the biggest part of my life is my wife and my children. I've been married 25 years, almost. I've got three children, two daughters, 23, 22, and a son who's 14. And I'm like, I'm a very boring guy. I've got two sides of my life work and them. Work and them. And so that's it. And nature. I love nature. I love hiking, I love looking at flowers and and the bees and the birds. Yeah.\n\nLev-Ram: Well, given everything that is on your plate, I would not say you're a boring guy. But, Joe, thank you so much for joining us today. It's been a really, really fascinating conversation. So thank you.\n\nKiani: Thanks for having me.\n\nMurray:Leadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergalla.\n\nLev-Ram: Our executive producer is Chris Joslin.\n\nMurray:Our theme is by Jason Snell.\n\nLev-Ram:Leadership Next is a production of Fortune Media.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Buffett’s Banking Bets: Analyzing the 3 Largest Bank Stocks in Berkshire’s Portfolio",
        "content": "Even before last year’s regional banking crisis, Warren Buffett was bailing on bank stocks. Gone from the portfolio were long-time holdings like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), U.S. Bank (NYSE:USB) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).\n\nHe became disenchanted with the financial institutions and how they operated. He thought they were taking “dumb” risks and were misleading investors by using deceptive accounting tricks to pad their bottom lines. After seeing some red flags in their financial statements, Buffett dumped their shares from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B).\n\nThe subsequent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank seemed to prove just what Buffett was saying.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd yet Buffett didn’t sell all of his bank stocks. In fact, he owns six bank stocks, a few acquired after he dumped many of the old line banks. For example, Nu Holdings (NASDAQ:NU), a new-fangled, all-digital Brazilian banking outfit, was bought in 2021. Recently he acquired stock in five Japanese banks, businesses he says he believes their United States counterparts could learn a lot from.\n\nBelow are three Warren Buffett bank stocks that comprise the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBuffet’s Bank Stocks: Citigroup (C) 2024 investment trends A close-up shot of money printing\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) is performing more like an artificial intelligence stock than a bank stock. Shares of the financial firm are up 63% from the lows hit last October and are running 21% higher in 2024. That vindicates the support Buffett has provided the bank, which assumes almost 1% in his portfolio.\n\nThe bank is undergoing a turnaround that is supercharging the stock. It reported first-quarter results last month that were better than Wall street expected. Revenue rose 1% from last year to $21.1 billion, better than analyst expectations of $20.4 billion. Although profits dropped 28% to $1.58 per share, they were much better than the consensus outlook of $1.20 per share. But Citi has now completed its overhaul that sought to significantly reduce costs, in part by effecting dramatic job cuts. It is also selling off over a dozen retail banking businesses.\n\nBanking was Citi’s top-performing segment in the quarter as revenue jumped 49% on the surprising strength of investment banking and corporate lending. The bank’s return on tangible common equity improved dramatically to 9.9% from 1% last year and a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter.\n\nBuffett owns 55.2 million shares of Citigroup, or 2.9% of the bank’s outstanding shares.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThought of as mostly as credit card company, American Express (NYSE:AXP) also offers savings accounts and certificates of deposit online. It also has an online bank called American Express National Bank with savings and checking accounts.\n\nAmerican Express is one of Buffett’s oldest holdings, first acquired back in 1991. Remarkably, he has not bought a single share of AmEx since the late 1990s but time and the effects of compounding allowed it to become the fourth biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Buffett owns 151.6 million shares of the financial company or 21.1% of the total outstanding shares. With the stake valued at $35.4 billion, American Express occupies nearly 10% of the portfolio’s total.\n\nAmEx also reported better-than-expected results with net interest income (NII), or the amount of money it earns from customers who keep a balance on their accounts, jumping 26% from last year. Not everyone fears the higher interest rates the Federal Reserve is charging. But by also targeting a younger demographic, American Express is enjoying significant growth. Chairman and CEO Stephen Squeri said  millennials and Gen Z consumers “accounted for over 60 percent of new consumer account acquisitions globally.”\n\nBank of America (BAC) A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe premiere Warren Buffett bank stock is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It was also one of the bank stocks he was buying as the regional banking crisis shook faith in the country’s financial foundations. It took his holdings to over 1 billion shares, or 13.2% of the outstanding total.\n\nAt today’s prices, that stake is valued it at $38.8 billion, only surpassed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $144 billion. As it is, the bank represents 10.7% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.\n\nThe financial giant, one of the biggest banks in the country, has also benefited from high interest rates boosting NII. While it also increased unrealized losses, Bank of America should be able to outlast the storm until those assets come to maturity. The stock market appreciates the stability the bank offers as shares have shot 50% higher from their lows and stand 12% above where they started 2024.\n\nThere is no indication Buffett plans to pare his stake in Bank of America as he has been doing with Apple and it will remain a stalwart of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Tech Stock Darlings to Scoop Up After Q2 earnings",
        "content": "Over the past year, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and cybersecurity propelled the tech sector to new Wall Street heights. As a result, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has returned over 35% in the past 12 months. Now that we are well into the second-quarter earnings season, investors are looking for tech stocks to buy after earnings.\n\nDespite the decline in the tech sector in April, many positive earnings surprises across sectors have led to renewed optimism on Wall Street. And, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, namely Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), are once again on investors’ radars.\n\nAnalysts have also been endorsing a number of tech darlings, especially citing AI’s role in the sector’s growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently raised Apple’s target price post-earnings, noting the quarterly performance, stock buyback and hints at AI updates to come. With that in mind, let’s explore three tech stocks to to buy after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company is Amazon, which reported impressive Q1 2024 financials on April 30. Revenues surged 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143 billion, driven by strong e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) performance. Net income tripled to $10.4 billion, or 98 cents per diluted share, compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company’s free cash flow surged to $50 billion. This is a notable improvement from the $3.3 billion outflow in the previous year.\n\nApart from a strong retail business fueled by robust consumer demand, Amazon’s strategic emphasis on AI infrastructure positions it for further growth. Innovations such as the Trainium and Inferentia chips optimize machine learning tasks, ensuring efficiency. Furthermore, the AI services platform, Bedrock, streamlines deployment and customization. And, third-party applications utilizing Amazon’s infrastructure expand its market presence and reach.\n\nAs a result, AMZN stock has gained 22% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are changing hands at 41 times forward earnings and three times trailing sales. Despite the relatively high valuation, analysts foresee further upside. They set a 12-month price target of $220, suggesting an 18% potential increase from current levels. Interested investors may consider the $180 level as a better entry point into Amazon shares.\n\nStory continues\n\niShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) iShares by Blackrock sign\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoward Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, noted that the information technology and communication services sectors, which comprise the majority of the tech industry, drove over 70% of the S&P 500’s total return of 26.3% in 2023. The “Magnificent Seven” played a significant role in this rally, contributing around 60% of the index’s total return.\n\nTherefore, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW) stands out as a compelling choice. This ETF provides a gateway to a diverse group of U.S. tech companies, reflecting a blend of established players and innovative disruptors.\n\nSince its inception in May 2000, IYW has demonstrated remarkable growth, now boasting net assets totaling $16 billion. The fund offers a comprehensive portfolio comprising 131 holdings, with the top ten commanding approximately 65% of the allocation.\n\nAmong its leading holdings are tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund maintains a diversified spread across sectors, including Software & Services (40%), Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment (30%), Tech Hardware & Equipment (18%) and Media & Entertainment (10%).\n\nIYW is up nearly 8% YTD and has gained almost 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broad S&P 500 index as well as the Nasdaq 100 index. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at around 36.5x and 9.5x, respectively. Finally, investors should note IYW’s expense ratio of 0.4%.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nOur final pick among top tech stocks to buy earnings is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The leading global provider of semiconductor solutions and wireless technology operates through Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL). QCT generates revenue from chipsets for the telecommunications industry, while QTL manages patent licensing.\n\nRecently, QCOM stock hit an all-time high after releasing impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The company reported $9.4 billion in non-GAAP revenues, a 1% increase from the previous year’s quarter, and $2.44 in diluted earnings per share, a 13% rise YOY that exceeded guidance. Notably, QCT Automotive saw exceptional growth, with a 35% surge in revenues due to expanded content in new vehicle launches featuring Snapdragon Digital Chassis products.\n\nInvestors have been following the anticipated demand for AI-equipped premium smartphones. Going forward, the company’s strategic diversification into emerging sectors like automotive, IoT and networking underscores Qualcomm’s commitment to long-term sustainability and revenue diversification.\n\nSo far in 2024, QCOM shares have returned 24%, and currently trade at around 19 times forward earnings and six times trailing sales, indicating a relatively premium valuation. Nonetheless, analysts’ price targets of $185 still imply an average upside potential of 3% from current levels. Finally, the stock also offers a 1.9% dividend yield.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil had both long and short positions in META stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "By Liam Mo and Brenda Goh\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Apple's iPhone shipments in China increased by 12% in March after the company and its retailers reduced prices, according to data from a research firm affiliated the Chinese government.\n\nShipments of foreign-branded phones in China increased by 12% in March to 3.75 million units from 3.35 million a year earlier，data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) published on Wednesday showed.\n\nAlthough the data did not explicitly mention Apple, the company is the dominant foreign phone maker in China's smartphone-dominated market. This suggests that the increase in foreign-branded phone shipments can be attributed to Apple's performance.\n\nApple's sales surge in March followed a ramped-up discounting effort led by the company and third-party sellers in the run-up to the month, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 10%.\n\nThe price cuts appear to have stimulated demand and contributed to the company's growth in the Chinese market. This represents a significant turnaround from the first two months of 2024, when Apple experienced a 37% slump in sales, according to Reuters calculations based on the CAICT data.\n\nDuring the first quarter of this year, Apple's smartphone shipments in China tumbled 19%, marking their worst performance since 2020, according to research firm Counterpoint. The primary reason for Apple's sales slump was the launch and successful sales of a high-end smartphone by Huawei in August of the previous year.\n\nApple's recorded sales of $16.37 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ended March 30 in the Greater China region, down 8.1% but above analyst expectations of $15.59 billion, data from Visible Alpha showed.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Brenda Goh; editing by Jason Neely)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "PayPal Stock Analysis: Why PYPL Is Still a Huge Bargain Right Now",
        "content": "In a column about PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) published on Oct. 19, 2023, I wrote that “PYPL stock trades at bargain-basement levels and has a new, up-and-coming CEO. Additionally, I believe the Street is overly worried about threats to PayPal’s dominance.” And I advised investors to “buy the shares on weakness.”\n\nThat turned out to be pretty good advice as shares jumped 20% between Oct. 19 and May 6. Also noteworthy is that, during the same period, the shares of SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI), a popular fintech name that I’ve been bearish on, fell 6%. And now, after PayPal reported standout first-quarter results and with its shares still trading at very low valuations, I continue to recommend that growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors buy the shares. Also importantly, the company has multiple, potential and strong positive catalysts.\n\nPayPal’s Strong Q1 Results\n\nThe fintech giant’s top line advanced 9.4% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $7.7 billion while its total payment volume (TPV) jumped an impressive 14% year-over-year (YOY) to $404 billion and its earnings per share rose 27% YOY to $1.08.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s continued strong revenue and TPV growth show that the Street’s worries about the firm losing market share to Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay are completely unfounded. And the large increase in its EPS suggests that the cost controls implemented by the firm’s new CEO Alex Chriss are bearing fruit.\n\nLow Valuation + Positive Catalysts = Buy\n\nDespite the recent, strong gains of PayPal stock, the name’s valuation continues to be exceptionally low and attractive.\n\nIndeed, the shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.3x and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 9.2 times. Given PayPal’s rapid revenue growth and the large increase in its profits, I believe that the stock remains extremely undervalued.\n\nOn the catalyst front, the firm is testing a new, fast checkout feature. According to Chriss, almost 80% of the consumers who have used the feature in tests utilize PayPal to pay when they check out again. Moreover, the conversion rates of the merchants who use it rise about 10%, the CEO reported.\n\nGiven these points, I believe that this offering will significantly increase PayPal’s payment volumes while enabling it to convince more vendors to utilize its platform.\n\nChriss also indicated that the firm is working harder than under his predecessor to market its fraud-prevention solution. Finally, PayPal has been convincing more small and medium businesses to use its Complete Payments suite. The CEO indicated that the companies that utilize this offering use more of PayPal’s products.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Chriss suggested that he would meaningfully increase the company’s low prices going forward.\n\nOver the longer term, I expect these initiatives, taken together, to enable the growth of PayPal’s top and bottom lines to meaningfully accelerate.\n\nPlenty of runway for growth\n\nThere are other indications besides the low valuation of the shares which suggest that the name can advance a great deal.\n\nFirst,the average price target of Street analysts on the stock is $71.48, meaningfully above its current price of around $65. Second, out of 35 analysts who cover the name, only 15 of them have “buy” ratings on the shares. As more of these analysts “see the light” and upgrade the shares, they are likely to rise meaningfully.\n\nFinally, the shares have a low Relative Strength rating of 48 and an average Accumulation/Distribution rating of C, according to Investor’s Business Daily. These metrics indicate that the stock has underperformed in the last year, while institutions have not bought a great deal of its in the last 13 weeks. As many more investors realize that PayPal stock is a bargain ,the shares should rally a great deal.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Which Credit Bureau Stock Should You Buy for the Long-Term?",
        "content": "When you write about the markets as much as I do, finding subjects to cover is challenging. A recent New York Times article about “Pay Later” lenders gave me an idea about credit bureau stocks to buy.\n\nThe Times article discussed how credit bureaus want to start including “buy now, pay later” purchases on consumer credit reports and credit scores.\n\nThis was prompted by Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) February move to start reporting loans made through its Apple Pay Later service to Experian (OTCMKTS:EXPGY), one of the three main credit bureaus.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA major issue with not reporting the loans is that it creates what experts call “phantom debt.” The credit bureaus argue that by including them, consumers are building credit. Pay-later lenders argue that each purchase makes a separate loan, hurting a consumer’s credit score.\n\nUltimately, the Times article concluded that pay-later firms will either be forced by regulators to report pay-later loans or market forces, such as loan delinquencies, will get them to act.\n\nEither way, the three credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion (NYSE:TRU), and Equifax (NYSE:EFX)—should remain integral to the lending industry.\n\nOne’s a Buy, one’s a Hold, and one’s a Sell.\n\nExperian (EXPGY) e-commerce alibaba amazon overstock\n\nSource: ©iStock.com/ebstock\n\nSeventeen analysts cover Experian. Of those, 14 rate it a Buy, with a $44.94 target price, about 9% higher than its current share price. Of the three stocks, Experian has the highest approval rating from analysts.\n\nExperian’s investor relations website cites five reasons why you should invest in the company: 1) It’s a market leader, 2) it has a purpose-driven growth strategy, 3) it has a sustainable focus and strong commitment to ESG, 4) it is financially sound, and 5) it has a rock-solid foundation for growth.\n\nThat’s corporate speak, for it’s one heck of a company.\n\nIn its latest presentation, the company points out that its 2023 revenue of $6.62 billion was higher than Equifax ($5.12 billion) and TransUnion ($3.71 billion). Further, it has the most globally diverse revenue, with 33% outside North America compared to 22% and 20% for the other two, respectively.\n\nThe company estimates its global addressable market opportunity is $150 billion annually. That’s a double-edged sword. On the one hand, there’s tremendous growth potential. On the other hand, it’s not going to be easy or cheap to grab a bigger piece of the pie.\n\nWhen in doubt, I look to free cash flow to decide if a company has what it takes for the long haul. In 2023, it was $1.11 billion, down from $1.31 billion a year earlier. Based on an enterprise value of $41.34 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperian is a Buy.\n\nTransUnion (TRU) Image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectory\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTransUnion is covered by 20 analysts. Of those, 16 rate it a Buy, with a $90.00 target price, about 14% higher than its current share price.\n\nAs I wrote in the previous section, TransUnion has the lowest annual revenue of the three credit bureaus. However, it’s nearly doubled since hitting a 52-week low of $42.09 in November 2023. Here’s why.\n\nIn Q1 2024, TransUnion delivered $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, up 8%, excluding currency, to $1.02 billion. Every region experienced a year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income for the quarter was $179 million, 16% higher than Q1 2023.\n\n“We are raising our 2024 guidance following first quarter outperformance and now expect to deliver 5 to 6.5 percent revenue growth for the year. We remain focused on driving strong results in a low-growth market environment, with no assumed in-year benefits from interest rate cuts,” stated CEO Chris Cartwright in its Q1 2024 press release.\n\nIn 2023, TransUnion’s free cash flow was $334.70 million. Based on an enterprise value of $20.08 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.7%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.\n\nTransUnion is a Hold.\n\nEquifax (EFX) A photo of the Equifax logo\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com\n\nEquifax is covered by 23 analysts. Of those, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $267.30 target price, about 16% higher than its current share price.\n\nOver the past year, Equifax stock has increased 15%, less than TransUnion, which has increased 21%, or Experian, which has increased 21.5%. That’s the bad news. The good news is that Equifax has significantly outperformed its two competitors over the past five years.\n\nEquifax was founded in Atlanta in 1899 as Retail Credit Company. It changed its name to Equifax in 1975.\n\nEquifax reported its Q1 2024 results in mid-April. Revenues, excluding currency, increased by 8% to $1.39 billion, while its net income rose 11% to $124.9 million. For all of 2024, it expects revenue of $5.72 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, 8.5% higher than 2023, with adjusted earnings per share of $7.35, 9.5% higher than a year ago.\n\nIn 2023, Equifax’s free cash flow was $515.5 million [operating cash flow of $1.12 billion less $601.3 million in capital expenditures], up considerably from 2023. Based on an enterprise value of $33.64 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.5%. Anything under 4% is overvalued.\n\nEquifax is a Sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meet the 2 Stocks Warren Buffett Confessed to Selling, as Well as the Other Core Holding He Likely Sent to the Chopping Block",
        "content": "In the nearly six decades Warren Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), he's delivered close to a 4,900,000% aggregate return to his company's Class A (BRK.A) shareholders, and practically doubled the annualized total return, including dividends, of the broad-based S&P 500. With outsized returns of this magnitude, it should come as no surprise that Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting draws around 40,000 investors each year who want to hear the affably dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" speak about investing philosophy and the U.S. economy.\n\nBut while Berkshire's annual shareholder meetings are filled with nuggets of investing wisdom from Warren Buffett, they also often contain confessions. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nOn Saturday, May 4, the Oracle of Omaha specifically called out two holdings that he and his top investment aides -- Ted Weschler and Todd Combs -- were selling during the March-ended quarter. Meanwhile, Berkshire's first-quarter operating results spilled the beans on another brand-name company that also looks to have been trimmed.\n\nApple: Approximately 115 million shares sold in the first quarter\n\nArguably the most surprising admission during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting was that Buffett and his team jettisoned approximately 115 million shares of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) during the March-ended quarter. We won't know the exact figure until Berkshire files its Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15.\n\nThis is actually the second consecutive quarter that Berkshire's largest position by market value has been pared down by the company's brightest investment minds. The logic behind this recent selling likely has to do with corporate taxation. Whereas the roughly 10 million shares of Apple sold during the fourth quarter were to offset select investment losses, the capital gains Buffett's company recognized from selling 115 million shares of Apple in the first quarter may have to do with front-running fiscal policy changes in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the moment, the peak federal corporate income tax rate is 21%. President Joe Biden has proposed increasing the peak rate to 28%. With higher tax rates likely in the future, Buffett has opined that investors won't gripe about locking in gains now at a lower corporate tax rate.\n\nDespite selling around 125 million shares of Apple, combined, over the previous two quarters, the Oracle of Omaha has made clear that it's going to be a longtime holding for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAlthough Apple's iPhone is the domestic leader in smartphone market share, and CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transformation of his company to promote subscription services, you'd be hard-pressed to find a catalyst Buffett appreciates more than Apple's market-leading capital-return program.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, Apple increased its quarterly dividend by $0.01/share -- Apple is set to dole out more than $15.4 billion in annual payouts to its shareholders -- and its board authorized up to $110 billion in additional share buybacks. Since the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock. Over time, these buybacks are incrementally increasing Berkshire's stake in the second-largest publicly traded company. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nParamount Global: Sold all 63,322,491 shares in the first quarter\n\nThe second high-profile stock the Oracle of Omaha confessed to selling during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting is underperforming media titanParamount Global(NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett commented that he sold the entire stake (more than 63.3 million shares, as of December 31), and that \"we lost quite a bit of money.\"\n\nBuffett also silenced ongoing rumors about the losses Berkshire absorbed from its stake in Paramount Global by absolving Todd Combs and Ted Weschler and noting that \"I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision.\"\n\nThe thumping Buffett took on his investment in Paramount can be traced to a couple of challenges. To start with, it's been tough sledding for certain types of advertisers over the past year and change. Specifically, legacy TV networks have seen ad dollars shift to streaming platforms. Between ongoing cord-cutting and select money-based indicators forecasting a recession, advertising revenue for its legacy networks has declined.\n\nThe other issue for Paramount Global has been its need to build out its streaming assets and content library to counter cord-cutting. Although revenue for its direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment surged 37% last year to $6.74 billion, the DTC segment is still losing a boatload of money. While increasing monthly subscription prices is part of the recipe to shrink these losses, Paramount's streaming segment is an undeniable drag on the company's bottom line.\n\nGiven these challenges, Paramount Global's future might entail it being acquired. Private equity company Apollo Global and Sony Pictures have sent a letter to Paramount's board where they've expressed interest in paying $26 billion, including debt, to acquire the company. Paramount has also had discussions about a potential merger with Skydance Media.\n\nWhile the advertising landscape should meaningfully improve this year, thanks in large part to higher spending during an election year, Paramount is going to need to address its steep DTC losses if it's to right the ship.\n\nChevron: Roughly 3 million shares sold in the first quarter\n\nEven though Warren Buffett didn't confess to selling shares of energy juggernaut Chevron(NYSE: CVX) in the March-ended quarter, Berkshire's first-quarter operating results appear to have spilled the beans.\n\nAs of the end of March, the fair value of Berkshire's investments in Chevron were listed as \"$19.4 billion.\" But based on Chevron's closing value of $157.74 on March 28, along with the 126,093,326 shares Berkshire held, as of Dec. 31, 2023, this position should have been fairly valued at nearly $19.9 billion. This roughly $500 million difference in fair value implies that the Oracle of Omaha and his team sent around 3 million shares of Chevron to the chopping block during the first quarter.\n\nSimilar to reducing his company's enormous stake in Apple, I wouldn't read too deeply into Buffett and his aides paring back their position in Chevron by a relatively small amount.\n\nFor starters, Berkshire's smartest investing minds realize how critical energy commodities like oil are to the U.S. and global economy. Buffett, Combs, and Weschler generally take a long-term view on the investments they make and realize that the U.S. economy tends to grow over long periods.\n\nTo add, Chevron should benefit from the tight global supply of crude oil. Major energy companies (including Chevron) were forced to pare back their capital spending for years during the pandemic. Further, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created energy supply concerns for Europe. As long as the supply of crude oil remains constrained, there's a reasonable likelihood that the spot price of crude will head higher. That's great news for Chevron's high-margin drilling segment.\n\nAnother reason Buffet & Co. trust in Chevron is its integrated operating structure. In addition to its drilling operations, Chevron owns transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. These are segments that provide steady operating cash flow and a hedge against a move lower in the spot price of crude oil.\n\nLastly, Chevron has one heck of a capital-return program. It recently raised its base annual dividend for a 37th consecutive year, and its board OK'd a repurchase program of up to $75 billion last year.\n\nMore than likely, Buffett and his team paring down their stake in Chevron represents nothing more than some minor profit-taking.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Stock buybacks hit highest level since 2018",
        "content": "Stock buybacks are soaring in a sign that corporate America is bullish on the US economy.\n\nCompanies have announced share repurchases of more than $383 billion in the last 13 weeks, up 30% from the year-earlier period and the largest sum since June 2018, per research from Deutsche Bank. The total includes Apple's $110 billion plan, the largest buyback in history.\n\nThe equity strategy team at Deutsche Bank notes that the \"boom\" in buybacks extends beyond the big names like Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which just announced a $70 billion buyback plan. Of the $262 billion in buybacks reported in first quarter earnings season, $82 billion has come from companies outside the large tech giants.\n\nThis is a welcome sign for those looking for a broadening out of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Buybacks have been the biggest driver of equities over time in the medium term,\" Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha told Yahoo Finance ahead of the start of first quarter earnings reports.\n\nTo Chadha, the importance of buybacks is simple: They tell investors how companies feel about the macro environment.\n\nBuybacks typically rise when earnings rise, Chadha said. This is because as earnings rise, which is currently happening at its fastest pace in nearly two years, cash flow at companies increases. Companies can then use this cash flow to increase dividends paid to shareholders, increase capital expenditures to invest back in the company, or repurchase stock, and, in turn, return capital to shareholders.\n\nThis trend failed to materialize in 2023. Earnings picked up, but buybacks didn't. Chadha reasoned this likely had to do with the overwhelming majority projecting a recession to hit the US economy.\n\n\"When macro consensus is for a severe slowdown, or recession, companies aren't going to do buybacks,\" Chadha said. \"They're going to hold on to their cash.\"\n\nBut that macro consensus has shifted. Economists and macro strategists are feeling more optimistic about economic growth for the US this year. Corporations are confirming that confidence with buybacks.\n\n\"What you saw in [fourth quarter] earnings reporting earlier this year is that buybacks really started to move back up,\" Chadha said. \"So I'd say that this cloud of a cyclical overhang is lifting. Corporates are getting more comfortable with the outlook.\"\n\nJPMorgan Private Bank global investment strategist Elyse Ausenbaugh noted that the tick-up in buybacks provides a \"nice foundation for investors\" as companies buying back their stock helps support the market even if individual equity investors aren't pouring money into stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd taken one step further, Ausenbaugh sees buybacks as just part of the case building in first quarter earnings that companies are seeing higher cash flows and using them in ways that should eventually benefit shareholders, like boosted capital expenditures for Big Tech companies.\n\n[Boosted capex is] going to continue to power these trends that have offered a lot of support for the market, like AI,\" Ausenbaugh told Yahoo Finance.

The market volume is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.10% during the forecasted period to reach 1.89 billion units by 2029.

        "title": "Big Afternoon for Earnings: RDDT, WYNN, LYFT &amp; More",
        "content": "Tuesday, May 7th, 2024\r\n\r\nWe were flat in regular market trading this Tuesday. That said, the Dow’s gain of +0.08% for the session marks the index’s fifth-straight higher close. The S&P 500 notches its fourth-straight up day, +0.13%. The Nasdaq broke its three-day winning streak with a marginal down ward move to -0.10%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed the field at +0.19%. Year to date, all four indices are back up into the green, led by the Nasdaq (+10%) and the S&P (+9%).\r\n\r\nToday ushered in a new Apple Event. What was once a routine game-changer back in the days when Steve Jobs ran Apple AAPL has given way to mostly updates to already offered devices, including the iPad Air and Apple Pencil Pro, while debuting its iPad Pro. Apple shares are already up from their mid-April trough, but well off levels near $200 per share back in January of this year. Shares are just about breakeven from the start of 2024 with marginal after-market gains today.\r\n\r\nReddit RDDT shares are up big after its inaugural earnings report. While Q1 earnings came in well below expectations to -$8.19 per share, revenues — by far the more important metric for a growing company like Reddit — reached $243 million, far better than the $212.4 million consensus estimate.\n\nFurther, next-quarter revenues have been guided up nicely to $240-255 million from an expected $221.4 million. Average Revenue per User came in at $2.98 versus $2.40 expected, and Q1 gross margins brought a very strong 88.6%. Shares rose nearly +19% immediately on the report’s release, but have ebbed back to +16%.\r\n\r\nLyft LYFT shares are also up big on its Q1 results. Earnings of 15 cents per share was nicely ahead of the +$0.09 per share expected, on $1.28 billion in sales, above the $1.17 billion in the Zacks consensus. The ride-share major brought 3.7 million new bookings, ahead of the projected 3.58 estimate. Average earnings beat over the trailing four quarters is a whopping +502% after a June 2023 quarter surprise of +1600%. Late-trading had brought the stock up +10%, now it’s +5%.\r\n\r\nWynn Resorts WYNN continues to enjoy a bounceback. Earnings in Q1 of $1.59 nicely improved over the estimated $1.40 per share, while $1.86 billion in revenues surpassed the $1.77 billion analysts were looking for. Macau adjusted EBITDAR rose to $411.7 million in quarter, zooming past the $230.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Las Vegas gains were higher, as well, on tougher comps. Shares remain +2.3% higher at this hour in late trading.\r\n\r\nElectronic Arts EA, on the other hand, posted a big miss on its fiscal Q4 bottom line. Earnings of 67 cents per share was less than half the $1.54 we were expecting, while top-line tallies of $1.67 billion missed the $1.78 billion estimate, with next-quarter revenue guidance lower than the current Zacks consensus. However, the videogame maker is hopeful a new NCAA football game offering will help turn around its fortunes, as full-year revenue estimates ratcheted somewhat higher.\r\n\r\nEV manufacturer Rivian RIVN was mixed in its Q1 report after today’s close. A negative earnings headline of -$1.48 per share was notably below the -$1.13 in the Zacks consensus, while revenues of $1.2 billion inched past the $1.15 billion estimate. The company expects to deliver 57K autos in 2024, although for the quarter, Rivian took a loss of -$38,784 per vehicle. Shares had fallen -3% on the news, but have improved to -1.5% at this hour.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "Buyback Bonanza: 3 Companies Scooping Up Shares",
        "content": "Stock buybacks, or share repurchase programs, are commonly executed by companies to boost shareholder value.\n\nA stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves.\n\nIn 2024, several companies – Apple AAPL, Marathon Petroleum MPC, and AutoNation AN – have unveiled repurchase programs. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nApple recently reported quarterly results, bringing post-earnings fireworks. Concerning headline figures, the company posted a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales 1% ahead of expectations.\n\nTo the surprise of many, the tech titan announced the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. Reflecting further positivity, Apple also unveiled a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMarathon Petroleum\n\nMPC is also coming off a recent double beat, with the company posting a 10% surprise relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reporting sales 6% ahead of the consensus. The company unveiled an additional $5 billion share buyback program.\n\nThe company’s earnings outlook overall remains positive across the board, with some adjustments hitting the tape post-earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAutoNation\n\nAutoNation shares have marginally outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, with its recent set of quarterly results boosting performance. The company recently unveiled an additional $1 billion share buyback program.\n\nThe company’s growth is forecasted to cool in its current fiscal year, with the $18.78 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting an 18% year-over-year decline on -0.2% lower sales. Growth is expected to resume modestly in FY25, as consensus expectations suggest a 5% recovery on 0.8% improved sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nA common way that companies amplify shareholder value is through implementing share buybacks. They can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, indicating that the company is utilizing excess cash and can help put in a floor for shares.\n\nAnd recently, all companies above – Apple AAPL, Marathon Petroleum MPC, and AutoNation AN   – unveiled additional or fresh buyback programs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Rivian reports mixed Q1 results, but trims capex forecast and sees Q4 'gross profit'",
        "content": "Rivian (RIVN) reported mixed quarterly results for the first quarter, but will see further cost savings from shifting its upcoming R2 production to its Normal, Illinois, plant and trimmed its capital expenditure forecast. The EV-maker also reaffirmed its full-year loss forecast, and still sees a \"path\" to \"modest gross profit\" in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.204 billion versus $1.175 billion expected, which is an 80% jump from a year ago. However, Rivian posted an EPS loss of $1.45 versus $1.27 estimated, with an operating loss $1.484 billion compared to $1.299 billion loss expected.\n\nRivian reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA loss forecast of of $2.70 billion for 2024, but now sees its capital expenditure (capex) outlays improving to $1.2 billion from $1.75 billion seen earlier due to moving the start of R2 production to its Normal, IL plant, with further capex savings seen in 2025 and 2026.\n\n\"We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X,\" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement.\n\nThe company also said as a result of its retooling upgrade and other improvements, Rivian remains \"confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year.\"\n\nBy shifting R2 production to its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, Rivian said on Tuesday the company will save more than $2.25 billion with the move. The company now sees its Normal capacity following the R2 launch and plant changes to hit 215,000 units of total annual capacity across all vehicles, which includes up to 155,000 units of the R2.

(Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nIn terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $7.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter.\n\nLast month the company reported first quarter R1T and R1S production of 13,980 and deliveries of 13,588, topping expectations of around 12,400 units. The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024.\n\nPart of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty. Though Rivian reaffirmed its forecast to reach “modest gross profit” by the end of 2024, Rivian didn't reiterate past statements that it was \"very close\" to achieving a positive contribution margin at the end of 2023.

(Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this year Rivian said its Georgia factory development is suspended for the moment, though Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the company wasn’t abandoning the project.\n\nStory continues\n\nScaringe said once the R2 was ready for a larger rollout, the upcoming Georgia facility would handle the rollout. The company also said it would be launching its R2 in Europe, which would be a huge market for the company as it's not currently selling its larger R1 vehicles on the continent.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "US Stocks Eye Fourth Positive Session Despite Hawkish Fed Remarks; Disney, Palantir Tumble; Treasury Yields Fall: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?\n\nWall Street experienced a quiet session during morning trading on Tuesday, influenced by a lack of significant economic data and minimal updates on earnings from major large-cap companies.\n\nTraders largely disregarded the latest hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who noted progress on inflation seen in the latter half of 2023 had stalled and mentioned the Federal Reserve might raise rates if inflation becomes persistent.\n\nKashkari also revealed he initially predicted two rate cuts for the year, but now anticipated possibly maintaining two, or reducing to one or none by the June Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nThe S&P 500 saw a modest increase of 0.2% around midday in New York, with similar gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones, all of which are poised for their fourth consecutive session of gains. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), representing small caps, performed notably well, rising 0.8%.\n\nTreasury yields declined slightly by about 6 basis points across various maturities from 5 to 30 years, with the 10-year benchmark decreasing to 4.4%, marking a fifth consecutive day of declines. This led to a continued rally in bonds, exemplified by a 1.1% increase in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT).\n\nIn corporate news, chipmaker Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) saw its shares drop over 13% following weaker-than-expected guidance. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) also fell sharply by over 10%, setting it on course for its worst performance day since November 2022.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remained stable at $63,800, while both gold and silver declined by 0.5%\n\nTuesday’s Performance In Major U.S. Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,072.99 0.7% S&P 500 5,193.42 0.2% Nasdaq 100 18,137.08 0.2% Dow Jones 38,914.33 0.2%\n\nUpdated at 12 p.m. EDT\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) rose 0.3% to $518.80, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.6% to $389.01 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) rose 0.3% to $441.54, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) outperformed, up 1.1%, followed by the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB), 1%. The ConsumerDiscretionary Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) was the major laggard, down 0.3%.\n\nTuesday’s Stock Movers\n\nRivian Automotive Inc.

        "content": "Beloved Apple AAPL has been in the headlines recently, with better-than-expected quarterly results bringing post-earnings fireworks. Up 8% over the last month, it seems that the technology titan has regained its mojo, outperforming relative to the S&P 500 in a big way. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecently, it was reported by the WSJ that the company has been developing chips for AI software in data centers, finally breaking a bit of the silence surrounding the company’s plans for the technology. And today, the company hosted its ‘Let Loose’ event, showcasing future products and giving the world a peek behind the scenes.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at what all the technology titan unveiled.\n\nApple Event\n\nApple announced the iPad Pro, the company's thinnest product ever (5.1 mm). The iPad Pro comes with the Apple M4 chip and OLED display, expected to deliver robust performance and considerably upgraded graphics.\n\nIn addition, the company also unveiled new versions of the iPad Air, now available in 11- and 13-inch models with Liquid Retina displays and powered by the Apple M2 chip. The new models could breathe some life into the company’s iPad sales, which missed our consensus expectations by roughly $390 million in its latest release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd finally, the Apple Pencil Pro was announced, now supporting ‘Find My’ and overall reflecting a considerable upgrade from previous generations. The Apple Pencil Pro boasts precise control and advanced features, including haptic feedback and barrel roll.\n\nAll in all, it was another successful event for the company despite nothing ‘groundbreaking’ being introduced.\n\nBottom Line\n\nApple’s ‘Let Loose’ event brought us several new developments, including new versions of the iPad and an upgraded Apple Pencil. Sentiment has slowly shifted positive for the company over the last month, with better-than-expected results driving performance.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the company recently announced the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. Reflecting further positivity, Apple also recently unveiled a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.

        "content": "*\n\nWalt Disney slumps on weaker TV business in Q2\n\n*\n\nTesla falls on China-made EV sales drop in April\n\n*\n\nPalantir slides on lower-than-expected annual rev. forecast\n\n*\n\nIndexes up: Dow 0.08%, S&P 0.14%, Nasdaq flat\n\n(Updated to 1755 GMT/1355 Eastern time)\n\nBy Shristi Achar A and David French\n\nMay 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Tuesday, on track for a fourth straight positive session fueled by renewed expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, despite declines in Walt Disney shares weighing on overall market gains.\n\nWalt Disney fell 9.8%, on track for its biggest percentage fall since November 2022, as a surprise profit in its streaming entertainment division was eclipsed by a drop in its traditional TV business and weaker box office.\n\nDespite Disney's drag, the three main U.S. stock indexes were trading at a more than three week high after a weaker-than-expected labor market report last week fueled bets that the U.S. central bank will cut rates.\n\nGenerally, the Fed and policymakers have been consistent in their message in recent weeks, that rate cuts will come but the central bank is going to be cautious in implementing them - a message repeated on Monday by Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams and Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin.\n\nThis meant, on a day lacking major data announcements, markets shrugged off comments from Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari that the Fed may need to hold rates steady for the remainder of the year due to stalled inflation and housing market strength.\n\nOverall, Friday's payrolls data and better-than-expected earnings reports have helped soothe investor jitters around sticky inflation and a robust economy that have kept the rates elevated.\n\n\"We've just come through an earning season that has improved people's perception of the earnings outlook, we're in this period where we don't see a ton of upside but certainly think that the pro-risk environment we've seen for the past week or so continues in the coming month,\" said Greg Boutle, head of US equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas.\n\nHe also added that the market \"can't go straight from being worried about the economy being too hot to too cold overnight.\"\n\nTraders are anticipating rate cuts of 46 basis points (bps) from the Fed by the end of 2024, according to LSEG's interest rate probabilities app, with the first pivot to rate cut seen in September and another in December. They were expecting only one cut before the labor report last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 01:55 p.m. Eastern ,the S&P 500 gained 7.22 points, or 0.14%, to 5,187.96 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.15 points, or 0.01%, to 16,347.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.42 points, or 0.08%, to 38,882.69.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq looked to extend gains for a fourth straight session in what would be their longest winning streak since March. The Dow was set for a fifth consecutive day of gains, its longest run of gains since December 2023.\n\nMegacap stocks Alphabet and Meta Platforms rose 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively, boosting the main indexes.\n\nNvidia fell 1.1% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was developing its own chip to run artificial intelligence (AI) software in data centers.\n\nApple gained 0.4% as it introduced a new chip called the M4, but put the new chip in an iPad Pro model rather than a laptop.\n\nTesla fell 3% after data showed the U.S. automaker sold 62,167 China-made electric vehicles in April, down 18% from a year earlier.\n\nPalantir Technologies tumbled 14.7% after the data analytics firm's annual revenue forecast fell short of analysts' estimates.\n\nOverall, nine of the 11 S&P sectors were trading higher, led by real estate and materials.

        "content": "As the stock market starts to pick up where it left off before running into April turbulence, value investors should be willing to give undervalued Nasdaq stocks a look. Some are cheaper after the latest round of earnings season, which was met with mixed results across the board.\n\nIn any case, don’t bet against the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now that it’s regained most of the ground it has lost in an ugly April. As the bull market commences, the following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are worth adding to the watchlist as tech momentum and Fed jitters ease. At the same time, quarterly earnings take a front-row seat.\n\nThe following undervalued Nasdaq stocks are among the timelier bets on the market, even if the latest earnings “bump” causes some investors to depart.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt was really hard to get over just how terrible the latest quarterly earnings results were for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The firm lowered full-year sales and earnings expectations while clocking in a sudden drop in profits. It was not only a bad showing by its new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, but it seems like the Starbucks growth thesis is broken as we know it.\n\nLegendary Starbucks founder and ex-top boss Howard Schultz recently commented on the matter, noting that its locations need a “maniacal focus on the customer experience,” Indeed, it appears Narasimhan has been doing his best to improve things at the store level (he’s taken shifts at Starbucks), but to no avail.\n\nYou can’t fault Starbucks entirely for the rough patch, though. The broader quick-serve restaurant scene has been rocked lately, with consumers responding to widespread price increases by putting away their wallets. Starbucks has just felt the industry hit a bit harder.\n\nI think Schultz, a notable “boomerang CEO,” may need to make another return to the helm if Starbucks’ latest crisis worsens. The stock has now shed around 42% of its value from its 2021 highs. That’s some serious underperformance that perhaps only Schultz may know how to solve. Either way, the stock looks super cheap right here.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) seems to be in an enviable position to monetize emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies as it brings its creative suite user base to this new era. That said, the stock hasn’t been booming of late compared to most other companies looking to tap into AI to jolt sales growth. The stock is down 15% year to date, while most other AI stocks have been gaining.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, it’s hard to be enthused about Adobe’s AI capabilities when incredible AI image generators Midjourney and OpenAI’s Dall-E may find themselves nipping at Adobe’s heels over the coming years. Despite this, I view Adobe as a Nasdaq darling and AI underdog that could have plenty of surprises up its sleeves as it continues rolling out new AI innovations.\n\nMore recently, the firm made a big splash in the realm of AI video generation and editing. From text-to-video to AI-assisted video editing in Premier Pro, it’s clear Adobe wants a big piece of the AI creative market.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock recently shocked investors with a historic $110 billion buyback announcement. The big buyback news and some better-than-expected quarterly numbers were enough to propel AAPL stock around 7%.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where Apple goes from here as it moves on from its two-year period of relative sluggishness. The stock is currently trading at 28.26 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) — not exactly cheap for a firm that’s run into a bit of a growth slump.\n\nAI rumors could certainly pick up traction as we inch closer to the second half. But could we be looking at a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation regarding AI?\n\nAs always, only time will tell. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to value Apple shares here, with Warren Buffett recently announcing that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) had slashed its stake by 13%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple, Berkshire Hathaway (Class B) and Starbucks.

        "content": "First-quarter earnings continued to come in better than expected last week, but it was the latest Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting which led to a pop in markets in the second half of the week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ruled out a rate hike at the next meeting, downplayed stagflation concerns and announced the central bank would slow the pace of balance sheet reductions, a move widely seen as a slight easing of monetary policy.[1]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SRE.\n\nRate cut hopes were raised even further on Friday when U.S. jobs data for April came in weaker than expected. Nonfarm Payrolls totaled 175,000, well below the Dow Jones consensus of 240,000. Unemployment, which has stayed consistently low, rose to 3.9%.[2] All major U.S. indices ended the day up 1 - 2% on the news.\n\nOn the earnings front, all eyes were on two more of the Magnificent 7 names, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Amazon surpassed both top and bottom-line expectations, driven by strength in ad revenue which increased 24% YoY, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) which grew 17%.[3] Apple was able to beat on earnings estimates, but missed on revenues as iPhone sales sunk 10% during the quarter.[4] Despite that disappointing result, which CEO Tim Cook blamed on difficult year-over-year comparisons, the tech behemoth showed there is no shortage of cash when they announced a $110 billion buyback, the largest-ever in history. The stock shot up 6% in after-hours trading.\n\nOn the flipside, there were some consumer-centric names that didn't fare well when they reported Q1 results last week. Results from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)[5], McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)[6] and Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM)[7] all showed that U.S. consumers were starting to hold back on dining out. All three missed on bottom-line expectations, while only McDonald's squeaked by on the top line. Consumers have remained resilient in the face of higher prices in the last two years, but inflation may finally be taking its toll.\n\nWith 80% of S&P 500 names reporting thus far, year-over-year earnings growth stands at 5% according to data from FactSet.[8] That's with 77% of companies surpassing analyst expectations, above the 10-year average, on par with the five-year average and just a little lighter than the one-year average of 78%. Revenues are still light, with only 61% of companies beating on the top-line, showing that many names are continuing to cost-cut their way to profitability.\n\nOn deck the last peak week of the first-quarter season\n\nThis week we get a smattering of results from different sectors, with 3,507 companies expected to report in total, the most of any week this season. Popular names to watch include Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) on Monday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Tuesday and Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues The Final Peak Week of the 1st-Quarter Season Begins Just as Earnings Hit Their Stride\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[9]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their first-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Loews Corp. (NYSE:L), Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Assurant Inc. (NYSE:AIZ), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), Jack Henry & Associates (NASDAQ:JKHY), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX) and NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis week will mark the final peak week of the first-quarter earnings season with 3,507 companies set to report. May 9 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,236 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 42% of companies have reported (out of our universe of 10,000-plus global names).

        "content": "Rivian Automotive(NASDAQ: RIVN) stock soared more than 8% in early trading on the Nasdaq this morning. (Hurray!)\n\nThen its stock turned tail, gave back most of its gains, and as of 10:30 a.m. ET, it was up only 1.6%. (Boo!)\n\nWhy did Rivian stock rise and then fall back again? The answer is just one word: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nRivian and Apple: A match made in heaven? (Or perhaps Detroit?)\n\nSo, here's the big news today about electric truck company Rivian and tech titan Apple: DigiTimes Asia reported today that Apple has been \"exploring collaboration\" with Rivian. The problem is that this rumor is primarily based on sources within the companies' supply chains and not directly from either Rivian or Apple. It also implies that the \"collaboration\" in question could be as limited as Rivian putting Apple CarPlay technology in its electric trucks and vans.\n\nThat's a far cry from, say, Apple lending its financial heft to Rivian as an alternative to Apple building its own electric car (a project that's now been canceled) or Apple deciding to buy Rivian outright (another rumor from earlier this year, which never materialized). Ultimately, MacRumors.com concludes that this latest rumor is \"very speculative.\"\n\nIs Rivian stock a buy?\n\nIn other words, you can probably ignore this particular rumor -- which, in fact, seems to be what investors are doing now after initially getting pretty excited over it.\n\nUnfortunately, this leaves Rivian investors owning the exact same stock they owned yesterday: a stock with less than $4.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet, but that's burning cash at nearly $6 billion a year. A stock that won't introduce its new R2 electric SUV until 2026 -- if the company survives that long. And a stock that just announced that the electric trucks it does have available for sale will grow their sales exactly 0% this year.\n\nCall me skeptical, but doesn't sound like much of a growth stock to me.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $564,547!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

They were expecting only one cut before the labor report last week.\n\nAt 11:22 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 86.20 points, or 0.22%, to 38,938.47. The S&P 500 gained 15.31 points, or 0.30%, to 5,196.05 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 37.65 points, or 0.23%, to 16,386.89.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq looked to extend gains for a fourth straight session in what would be their longest winning streak since March. The Dow was set for a fifth consecutive day of gains, its longest run of gains since December 2023.\n\nMegacap stocks such as Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon rose between 0.4% and 1.6%, boosting the main indexes.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia fell 1.7% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was developing its own chip to run artificial intelligence (AI) software in data centers.\n\nApple gained 0.4% as it introduced a new chip called the M4, but put the new chip in an iPad Pro model rather than a laptop.\n\nTesla fell 2.7% after data showed the U.S. automaker sold 62,167 China-made electric vehicles in April, down 18% from a year earlier.\n\nPalantir Technologies tumbled almost 14% after the data analytics firm's annual revenue forecast fell short of analysts' estimates.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.7-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 1.7-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and two new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 108 new highs and 52 new lows.

        "title": "Google debuts $499 Pixel 8a as it pushes generative AI to more consumers",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is bringing its generative AI smarts to a broader audience with the debut of its new Pixel 8a smartphone on Tuesday. The phone, which starts at $499, comes with many of the generative AI features found on its pricier Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 devices, including photo and video editing capabilities.\n\nGoogle says the 6.1-inch Pixel 8a will get access to the company’s Gemini generative AI chatbot, as well as generative AI-powered features such as Best Take and Circle to Search. The company also says users will eventually get access to Gemini Nano, a smaller version of the Gemini large language model that runs directly on the Pixel 8a, in a future update.\n\nThe standard version of Gemini requires an internet connection so it can process your requests through Google’s cloud servers. Gemini Nano runs directly on your device, allowing it to perform certain generative AI tasks without accessing the web. Google has debuted its new Pixel 8a smartphone, bringing its generative AI features to a broader audience. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nThe Pixel 8a packs Google's latest Tensor G3 chip, 128GB of storage with an option to upgrade to 256GB, and a new 120-hertz display for smoother gaming and scrolling. There’s also a 64-megapixel wide-angle camera with Super Res Zoom that simulates a telephoto lens and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera.\n\nGoogle previously rolled out a number of the Pixel 8a’s generative AI features alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in October. The standout AI offering is Magic Editor, which allows you to remove unwanted people and objects from images or move them around your photo by simply circling them. I could, for instance, change a photo of myself to make it look like I was dunking a basketball, something I could never do, or edit out a passerby who got in my shot to make it appear as though they were never there.\n\nCircle to Search is a similarly interesting feature that allows you to circle an object in an image and instantly look for it online via Google search. The idea is to make it easier to find products you’ve seen in a photo and purchase them online. You can also highlight text in an image to quickly search for it via Google, as well.\n\nThen there’s Best Take, which is meant for use with group photos. When you take a picture, Best Take will grab a series of images of everyone’s face. If someone blinked in the shot, you can use Best Take to swap out the person’s face with one of the shots in which they didn’t blink. Best Take only changes the person’s face, not their body.\n\nThere’s also Magic Audio Eraser, which helps you cut out background noise in your videos and better isolate the sound of the main subject.\n\nAll of this is part of Google’s effort to turn its generative AI offerings into compelling consumer features that will drive device sales across its Android line of smartphones. The company has also teamed up with Samsung to bring some of the same capabilities to that company’s Galaxy S24 line of phones.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI is seen as the next catalyst to push smartphone sales forward, but there’s still no specific app that is pushing consumers to get out and buy new AI-powered phones. That said, Google is preparing to host its annual Google I/O developer conference on May 14, where it could debut new, truly must-have generative AI features for its Android devices.\n\nGoogle rival Apple (AAPL) is also preparing to reveal a raft of generative AI capabilities for its various products during its WWDC event in June.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google rolled out a new version of its $499 lower-end Pixel smartphone, aiming to entice budget-minded shoppers with an updated screen and artificial intelligence features.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Short High-Tech Trading Firms Race to Grab Bond Market Turf Russians Are Coming to Terms With Putin’s War in Ukraine Jack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X ‘Freedom Technology’\n\nThe Pixel 8a device, which comes a year after the 7a model, adds a faster processor, brighter screen, an option for double the storage and new AI features for the camera, the company said on Tuesday. Google is also cutting the price of its Pixel Tablet by offering a new $399 version that doesn’t come with a charging stand.\n\nThe unveiling — coming within hours of Apple Inc. introducing new iPad models — is an attempt to get more aggressive in phones and tablets. Though Google’s Android software is used by much of the device industry, its own hardware products have made less of a dent.\n\nThe updated Pixel phone looks slightly different than the 7a, with more rounded edges. And it comes in four newly named colors: obsidian, porcelain, bay and aloe. The aluminum frame around the phone has a satin texture, while the back is now made from a grippier matte material instead of glossy plastic.\n\nThe $499 model continues to include 128 gigabytes of storage, but a pricier 256-gigabyte version also is available for the first time. The new screen is 40% brighter and includes a faster, 120-hertz refresh rate, matching screens on many higher-end devices. The Pixel Tablet bundled with a stand still costs $499.\n\nA big focus of the new phones is AI software capabilities. That includes a Circle to Search feature that first debuted on Samsung Electronics Co. devices earlier this year. It lets you seek more information on objects on your screen by circling them your finger, without having to leave the app. There also are AI enhancements for photos and videos.\n\nLike the 7a, the 8a will be manufactured in Vietnam — part of a larger push by electronics makers to build devices outside China.\n\nThe announcements come a week ahead of Google’s I/O event, where it will roll out new AI and Android software features. It’s been an eventful few weeks for the Google division. The company just reshuffled its management to put Pixel head Rick Osterloh in charge of Android and its other software platforms.\n\nRead More: Apple Rivals Retool to Challenge iPhone and Vision Pro\n\nGoogle has shown recent signs of progress, following years of struggling to compete with Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands.

        "content": "Apple on Tuesday unveiled its next generation of iPad Pros and Airs — models that will boast faster processors, new sizes and a new display system as part of the company's first update to its tablet lineup in more than a year.\n\nThe showcase at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, comes after the company disclosed its steepest quarterly decline in iPhone sales since the pandemic’s outset, deepening a slump that’s increasing the pressure on the trendsetting company to spruce up its products. Apple is expected to make a much bigger splash next month during an annual conference devoted to the latest version of its operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers — software that analysts expect to be packed with more artificial intelligence technology.\n\nBoth lines of new iPads add bells and whistles but have adjusted prices to match. The iPad Pro sports a new thinner design, a new M4 processor for added processing power, slightly upgraded storage and incorporates dual OLED panels for a brighter, crisper display. Prices have been hiked to match its new offerings, with the 11-inch model going for $999 and the 13-inch model fetching $1,299.\n\nThe new iPad Air has the faster M2 chip, boasts a new design, more base storage, a new 13-inch display option and a recentered camera. It will also support use of the new Apple Pencil Pro, which was a function previously exclusive to the Pro models. The 11-inch display will sell for $599 while the new 13-inch model will fetch $799.\n\nHowever Apple did announce a price reduction for its 10th generation iPad, which will now retail for $349, down from $449.\n\nAll the new models will be available in stores starting May 15, with preorders beginning Tuesday.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Rivian Q1 preview: Profit path, margins, and vehicle roadmap in focus",
        "content": "Rivian (RIVN) will give investors a crucial first quarter update on its financials as the pure-play adventure EV maker attempts to turn the tide from losses to profit this year.\n\nIn the first quarter Rivian revealed its upcoming R2 mid-size EV and strong Q1 sales, but also announced job cuts and a pause in the development of its Georgia plant. The company also received a financial boon from the state of Illinois: an $827 million incentive package to expand its facility in the city of Normal.\n\nConserving cash while still developing its new vehicles (and retooling its existing Normal plant) is of paramount concern for investors as 2024 progresses.\n\nFor the quarter, Rivian is expected to report revenue of $1.175 billion, a massive 78% jump from a year ago. The revenue bump will not translate into profit yet, with the company expected to report an adjusted loss of $1.15 per share, with an adjusted net income loss of $1.129 billion. Operating profit is expected to come in slightly worse, with a $1.299 billion loss, along with EBITDA of negative $856.6 million.\n\nLast month the company did, however, report first quarter R1T and R1S production of 13,980 and deliveries of 13,588, topping expectations of around 12,400 units. The company also reaffirmed production guidance of 57,000 vehicles in 2024.\n\nInvestors will also be looking for any updates on Rivian’s full-year profitability metrics. Rivian previously said it sees an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.70 billion for 2024, with capital expenditure outlays hitting $1.75 billion.\n\nPart of bringing down those costs came in the form of a 10% salaried staff reduction, with the company citing economic uncertainty. During its Q4 earnings report, Rivian reiterated its forecast to reach “modest gross profit” by the end of 2024. CFO Claire McDonough noted that the company was \"very close\" to achieving a positive contribution margin at the end of 2023.\n\nIn terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $7.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q4, down from the $9.1 billion it had at the end of Q3.\n\nR2 and future vehicles Founder and CEO of Rivian RJ Scaringe speaks onstage during the Rivian Reveals All-Electric R2 Midsize SUV event at Rivian South Coast Theater on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nIn March at an event in Laguna Beach, Calif., Rivian unveiled its smaller, less expensive electric R2 SUV, which is expected to arrive in 2026. In a surprise announcement, the company also revealed smaller R3 crossovers, which gave the stock a boost, though shares are still down a whopping 55% year to date.\n\nRivian also said it will produce the R2 at its existing US factory instead of its upcoming Georgia factory, saving the company more than $2 billion. Rivian said its Georgia factory development is suspended at the moment, though Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe reaffirmed the company wasn’t abandoning the project.\n\nStory continues\n\nScaringe said once the R2 was ready for a larger rollout, the upcoming Georgia facility would handle the rollout. The company also said it would be launching its R2 in Europe, which would be a huge market for the company as it's not currently selling its larger R1 vehicles on the continent.

(Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Rivian) (Phillip Faraone via Getty Images)\n\nWall Street is still skeptical of the Rivian profitability story, even with the wider appeal of the R2.\n\n“In our view, the path to R2 profitability would also be harder to believe if the company cannot deliver gross margin positive on R1,” Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner wrote following the R2’s reveal.\n\n“Furthermore, with R2 priced starting $45k and directly competing with Tesla’s Model Y (priced at $44k for the lowest trim), we wonder how Rivian will be able to achieve positive margin with much more content, and more limited scale vs. Tesla who has world-class sourcing conditions,” he said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It’s available to order starting today! pic.twitter.com/zzrNT6civ5\n\n— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) May 7, 2024\n\nThe new iPad Pro will include a high-quality OLED display for the first time, as well as Apple’s new, own-made, top-of-the-range M4 chip, which the company says mean the new devices are 50% faster than the previous generation and ten-times faster than the original iPad Pro model.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple senior vice president of hardware engineering, John Ternus, said the new Pro “pioneers our most advanced technologies, and pushes the limits of what an iPad can be”, adding that the new device was the “iPad we’ve always dreamed of making”.\n\nThe new Pro is also the thinnest product Apple has ever made, the company says, noting during its presentation that it was thinner than its pocket-sized iPod Nano, with both versions of the Pro just over 5mm thick.\n\nIt will go on sale next week alongside a new version of the iPad Air, which will be sold in its traditional 11-inch size, as well as in a new 13-inch model.\n\nIt too has been given a faster Apple chip – the M2 – which Apple says will make the new Air 50% faster than its previous model.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new tablets will be joined by a new stylus – the Apple Pencil Pro – which users can squeeze to interact with for the first time, and an updated version of the firm’s Magic Keyboard.\n\nIndustry expert Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple would be looking to “reinvigorate” its tablet range with the updates.\n\n“Although tablets are one of Apple’s less prominent products, the iPad generated 5.6 billion dollars in revenue in the company’s most recent quarterly earnings, surpassing the total revenue of many rival device makers,” he said.\n\n“However, given this was more than 15% down year-on-year, Apple is undoubtedly keen to reinvigorate the category, particularly in the premium tier.\n\n“Whilst these new iPads are unlikely to return the category to growth immediately, they represent a much-needed reason to upgrade for customers with ageing products.\n\n“The emphasis on artificial intelligence was palpable with Apple determined to seize back the initiative in this area given the huge focus on this topic by all its rivals over the last 18 months.”\n\nAlthough Apple did not announce any major new AI tools during the event, company executives did repeatedly refer to the new chips in both devices allowing for better AI performance going forward.\n\nIt is expected to more broadly discuss its plans around AI during its annual developer conference, WWDC, which takes places in California next month.",

        "title": "12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best large-cap growth ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on growth investing, head over to 5 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs.\n\nLarge-cap growth funds focus on investing in big companies, those in the top 70% in terms of market value. Growth funds constitute companies expected to grow their revenue or earnings faster than their peers or the overall market. They are often seen as risky but can be good for investors who are not risk averse and prefer long-term investments.\n\nTom Hancock, who heads focused equity at GMO, joined CNBC’s ETF Edge on November 15, 2023, and remarked that the growth trade momentum is aided by the leadership of mega-cap tech companies that are embracing artificial intelligence. Similarly, Nathan Geraci, president of The ETF Store, agreed with Hancock's observation but noted that only a couple of stocks are leading the growth outperformance. In his words, Geraci commented:\n\n“A lot of growth performance this year has been driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven, because if you look at many of the growth indices, they’re pretty top-heavy. The largest growth companies have been enough to really drive that performance differential versus value.”\n\nCurrently, US small-cap stocks are experiencing their toughest period compared to larger companies in over two decades. This reflects the investor preference for mega-cap tech stocks while smaller players grapple with inflated interest rates. According to a Financial Times report, the Russell 2000 index has seen a 24% increase since the start of 2020, significantly trailing behind the S&P 500's impressive 60% surge during the same period. This deviation from historical norms, where smaller, fast-growing companies typically offer higher returns despite higher volatility, underscores the current market dynamics. Greg Tuorto, a small-cap portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, pointed out the lack of significant investment in the small-cap space since 2016 or 2017, highlighting the need for increased market enthusiasm, perhaps through M&A activity or a flourishing IPO market, to reignite small-cap growth. While there are indications of the equity market expanding beyond tech giants, persistent inflation and a strong job market have led traders to accept the likelihood of higher interest rates for longer than previously anticipated. In a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains or even raises rates, smaller companies with significant short-term or floating-rate debt, like those in the Russell 2000, are likely to be most affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther making a positive case for large-cap ETFs compared to their small-cap counterparts, an academic research paper took a close look at 66 large-cap and 34 small-cap ETFs listed in the United States from 2012 to 2016, covering the full trading history of these funds. The author chose to focus on the US market because it is a major player globally, and he wanted a robust sample size for the analysis. The study partially confirms what's known as the \"size effect\". Essentially, small-cap ETFs showed better returns compared to large-cap ETFs when looking at both raw and adjusted numbers. However, it is not all smooth sailing for small caps – they come with higher risk, which does not quite balance out the gains. Plus, this outperformance is not consistent year after year. When adjusted for risk, small-cap ETFs actually fall behind their larger counterparts. The same trend holds true when comparing the performance rankings of large-cap and small-cap ETFs.\n\nSome of the best large-cap growth ETFs include Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (NYSE:SCHG), Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VUG), and Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). These funds expose investors to growth stocks like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of May 3, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 12 Best Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\nA close-up image of a stock market graph displaying the growth of the company's mutual funds.\n\nBest Large-Cap Growth ETFs\n\n12. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 69.29%\n\nFirst Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) aims to mirror the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Growth Index. It seeks to achieve similar investment outcomes in terms of both price and yield, excluding fees and expenses. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC)’s net expense ratio stands at 0.60% as of December 1, 2023. As of May 2, 2024, the fund’s net assets exceed $1 billion, and its portfolio comprises 187 holdings, excluding cash. First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to monitor.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is one of the top holdings of First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund (NASDAQ:FTC). According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 56 hedge funds held stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), compared to 57 funds in the earlier quarter. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is the leading position holder in the company, with a stake worth $1.88 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a popular stock among elite hedge funds.\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top Q1 contributors were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), Shockwave Medical and Spotify. Chipotle’s combination of superior quality and speed of service has created a strong brand affinity, and the company is currently expanding its store count at a growth rate of 8%–10% annually. With each restaurant generating an annual income of around 60% of its original investment cost, the implied payback period is less than two years. Given these attractive economics, we believe a long runway remains for market penetration potential. Next, increased accessibility and convenience have been a strategic priority, leading it to add secondary “make lines” that enable each store to meet increased demand from third-party delivery services and the company’s own digital pickup lanes (“Chipotlanes”). And last, evidence is emerging that the company’s post-COVID training initiatives (“the four pillars of throughput”) are resulting in higher peak-time productivity. Overall, the profit cycle remains nicely in motion, and the stock remains a large CropSM holding.”\n\n11. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 81.23%\n\niShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) ranks 11th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG) aims to replicate the performance of S&P 900 Growth Index, which consists of large and mid-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. This ETF focuses on companies expected to experience earnings growth exceeding the market average. iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)’s net assets amounted to $16.5 billion as of May 2, 2024. The fund features a portfolio comprising 473 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.04%.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) occupies the largest position in iShares Core S&P U.S. Growth ETF (NASDAQ:IUSG)’s portfolio. According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was found in 302 hedge fund portfolios, with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holding the biggest stake in the company, comprising 38.2 million shares worth $14.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds best-in-class platforms and provides services that help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, software development tools, video games, and business-solution applications. The company also designs, manufactures, and sells devices, including PCs, tablets, and gaming/entertainment consoles that all integrate with Azure, its cloud computing service. In the quarter Microsoft’s stock appreciated based on excitement surrounding the company’s positioning in the generative AI market and its ability to monetize the coming wave of corporate investment in supercomputing and AI, which will be through both Azure and Microsoft Copilot, the company’s new GenAI personal assistant.”\n\n10. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 82.91%\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) is placed 10th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW) seeks to replicate the performance of S&P 500(R) Growth Index, which is composed of large-cap US stocks known for their growth potential. The ETF was launched on May 22, 2000. Its net assets amounted to $42.8 billion as of May 2, 2024. iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW)’s portfolio comprises 228 holdings, along with an expense ratio of 0.18%.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd in the portfolio of iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW). Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database reveals that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of 131 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 134 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 905.56 million shares worth $174.3 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a global consumer electronics and software company that designs and markets mobile communications devices (iPhones), personal computers (Macs), multi-purpose tablets (iPads), and wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods, and Accessories). The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock’s underperformance during the quarter was due to fears that the company’s slowing top-line growth and increased competitive threats make the stock’s premium valuation harder to justify.”\n\n9. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 83.73%\n\nVanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) invests in stocks from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Growth Index. Its primary objective is to closely mirror the returns of this index, which is considered a benchmark for overall US growth stock performance. The ETF was established on September 7, 2010. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG) features an expense ratio of 0.10% and its portfolio comprises 228 stocks. As of March 31, 2024, VOOG’s net assets came in at $10.3 billion.\n\nSemiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top holdings of Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:VOOG). As per Insider Monkey’s Q4 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was found in 173 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 180 in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is one of the largest stakeholders of NVIDIA, with 13.90 million shares worth $6.88 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we entered two new positions, while exiting four positions. Our first new position was NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which we bought early in the quarter. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and FCF an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While much of the focus is on Nvidia’s market cap reaching $2.3T, up 230% over the last year, the company’s valuation has actually come down over that period. As of 3/31/23, consensus was valuing the company at 61x forward EPS. This compares to today, where the company is being valued at 37x. While yes, we have never seen a company expand their market cap by so much so quickly, we have also never seen a company grow their fundamental earnings and cash generation so quickly (and which is actually expanding faster than valuation). While competitors are working to enter the GPU space, Nvidia has created a moat around their GPUs with their CUDA software offering. While we do expect the large cloud players to continue to move into the market, we think NVDA can continue to demand top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of accelerated computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) was a top performer in the quarter gaining 82.5% in the period. While the company has had an impressive run, gaining 242% over the last year, the valuation has been supported by the impressive growth in Revenue (126%), EPS (392%) and free cash flow (610%) over the last year. The company has solidified its position in the GPU space supported by its proprietary software CUDA. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\n8. iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 92.31%\n\niShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG) seeks to replicate the performance of the Morningstar US Large-Mid Cap Broad Growth Index, consisting of US equities with growth traits from both large and mid-cap categories. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs to buy. As of May 2, 2024, iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s net assets came exceeded $2 billion. The fund features an expense ratio of 0.04% and a portfolio comprising 392 holdings.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 4th in iShares Morningstar Growth ETF (NYSE:ILCG)’s portfolio. Insider Monkey’s Q4 database found that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was held by 293 smart hedge funds, up from 286 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 41.78 million shares worth $6.34 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 94.88%\n\nFidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) strives to mirror the price and yield performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is a weighted index reflecting the market capitalization of stocks listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. It is one of the best large-cap growth ETFs, ranking 7th on our list. Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ) was launched on September 9, 2003. As of March 31, 2024, the fund holds $6.08 billion in portfolio assets, while featuring a portfolio comprising 1,006 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.21%.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top holdings of Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ). Hedge fund ownership in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) increased to 242 funds at the end of December 2023, compared to 234 in the previous quarter. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is one of the key stakeholders of the company, with 7.46 million shares worth $2.6 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year’s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.”\n\n6. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of May 3: 100.46%\n\nNuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) ranks 6th on our list of the best large-cap growth ETFs. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) follows a passive management strategy, investing primarily in large-cap US equity securities displaying growth characteristics and meeting required environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. It aims to replicate the investment outcomes of the TIAA ESG USA Large-Cap Growth Index, excluding fees and expenses. The fund was launched on December 16, 2016. Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG) features an expense ratio of 0.26% and holds $1.3 billion in net assets as of May 2, 2024.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the largest holdings of Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth ETF (BATS:NULG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was part of 166 hedge fund portfolios at the conclusion of December 2023, up from 163 in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of Alphabet, with a position worth $2.9 billion.\n\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top growth plays on the radar of smart investors.\n\nPalm Valley Capital Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Governments have various irons in the fire for curbing (commandeering?) the power of tech titans, with the European Union rolling out the Digital Markets Act, the Federal Trade Commission suing Amazon for illegally using monopoly power, and the DOJ lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advertising business going to trial in September.\n\nFurthermore, the dominant technology enterprises are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot. Google’s botched launch of its AI model, Gemini, shows the risk of having too much money. You lose discipline. A Pirate Wires exposé into the firm’s culture revealed that employees went to extreme lengths to intentionally degrade the quality of the AI engine’s output for ideological reasons. Try that as a small business!

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) - The manager of an Apple Inc retail store in Manhattan violated U.S. labor law by asking an employee whether he supported a union campaign, a federal labor board has ruled in its first decision involving the tech giant.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in a single-page ruling late on Monday said the manager's questioning of the worker, who had raised concerns about pay at a group meeting, amounted to unlawful interrogation and upheld a decision by an administrative judge.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled board also affirmed the judge's ruling that Apple illegally barred workers at the World Trade Center store from distributing union flyers.\n\nApple, which has denied wrongdoing, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company can appeal the decision to a federal appeals court.\n\nAt least two Apple stores in the U.S. have unionized since 2022, and unions are working to organize several other locations including the World Trade Center store.\n\nWorkers and unions have filed more than two dozen complaints with the NLRB accusing Apple of a range of unlawful conduct. At least three of those cases are pending before administrative judges, including claims that Apple has refused to bargain at a unionized store in Oklahoma City.\n\nApple has denied wrongdoing in those cases. In Monday's case, the company had argued that the store manager had no intention to threaten the worker and her questioning of him was not the type of extensive interrogation the board had found unlawful in previous cases.\n\nThe board in a footnote in its decision said the manager's intent was irrelevant. The ruling requires Apple to post notices at the store informing workers that it violated the law and informing them of their legal rights.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple debuts iPad Pro with M4 chip as company looks to turn around sales",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) debuted its latest lineup of iPads during a virtual launch event on Tuesday. The new tablets include more powerful versions of the $999 11-inch and $1,299 13-inch iPad Pro outfitted with Apple's M4 chip and more vibrant OLED displays, and an upgraded iPad Air, which gets a 13-inch screen option to go along with the existing 11-inch version.\n\nThe company also unveiled the latest version of its Apple Pencil stylus complete with a new haptic feedback feature and an updated Magic Keyboard case for the iPad Pro line.\n\nThe new iPad Pros come equipped with Apple's new Ultra Retina XDR displays, which use OLED technology to improve overall color quality. Apple says the screens, its most advanced yet, use two OLED panels to form what the company calls its Tandem OLED panel.\n\nOLED panels are known for their exceptional color quality, but they're also thinner than traditional LCD screens. That, Apple says, makes the 10.9-inch iPad Pro just 5.3mm thick and the 13-inch model just 5.1mm thick, making them the company's thinnest devices ever.\n\nIn addition to their new screens, the iPads come with Apple's new M4 chip. The first device to get Apple's latest silicon, the chip makes the latest iPad Pro 4 times faster than the iPad Pro with Apple's M2 processor and 10 times faster than the original iPad Pro.\n\nThe M4 runs on Apple's second-generation 3 nanometer technology and features 4 performance cores for heavy duty processing and 6 efficiency cores less resource intensive applications. The company says the M4 provides up to 50% faster CPU performance than the M2 in the iPad pro. On the graphics side of things, Apple says the M4 has a 10-core GPU and provides 4 times faster graphics performance than the M2.\n\nApple also hinted on its AI ambitions, saying that the M4's new 16-core neural engine is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any PC today. Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm are all putting neural processing units into their latest processors to power onboard AI applications. Apple, however, was sure to point out that it's been adding neural engines to its processors for years, implying that it has a significant lead in the space.\n\nThe iPad Air, Apple's mid-range tablet, now comes with a 13-inch screen option to go along with the standard 10.9-inch model. Apple says roughly half of iPad Pro consumers opt for the larger 13-inch iPad Pro, giving them a reason to go for the larger screen option.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe front camera is now in the center of the side bezel so you can use it in landscape mode while making FaceTime calls and sports spatial audio. The 13-inch model gets double the base of the 11-inch.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth iPad Airs now come with Apple's M2 chip, making it 50% faster than the prior iPad Air with the M1 chip, and 3x faster than the A14-equipped Air. The Air also works with Apple's Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil stylus. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the 13-inch version starts at $799.\n\nDuring Tuesday's event Apple also unveiled its Apple Pencil Pro stylus. The accessory, priced at $129, now includes a haptic feedback feature that produces a slight vibration to let you know when you've successfully selected something on screen. There's also a built-in gyroscope that lets you roll the Apple Pencil Pro to choose specific inputs in drawing and painting apps. Find My compatibility also means you can quickly locate your pencil if you misplace it.\n\nApple's latest iPads come as the product line is mired in a sales slump. In 2022, the company reported iPad revenue of $29.29 billion, down 8% from the $31.86 billion it brought in in 2021. Declines continued in 2023, though they were less severe, with sales falling 3% on the year.\n\nSales continued to falter in Q1 and Q2 this year, dropping 22% and 17%, respectively. Apple's latest tablets, however, should give the lineup a much-needed sales boost. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the industry-leading power-efficient performance of Apple silicon. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nM4 enables the breakthrough design and stunning display of the new iPad Pro, while delivering a giant leap in performance\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., May 07, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced M4, the latest chip delivering phenomenal performance to the all-new iPad Pro®. Built using second-generation 3-nanometer technology, M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the industry-leading power efficiency of Apple silicon and enables the incredibly thin design of iPad Pro. It also features an entirely new display engine to drive the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR™ display on iPad Pro. A new CPU has up to 10 cores, while the new 10-core GPU builds on the next-generation GPU architecture introduced in M3, and brings Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading to iPad® for the first time. M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,\" said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. \"The power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.\"\n\nNew Technologies Enabling the New iPad Pro\n\nDelivering a giant leap in performance over the previous iPad Pro with M2, M4 consists of 28 billion transistors built using a second-generation 3-nanometer technology that further advances the power efficiency of Apple silicon. M4 also features an entirely new display engine designed with pioneering technologies, enabling the stunning precision, color accuracy, and brightness uniformity of the Ultra Retina XDR display, a state-of-the-art display created by combining the light of two OLED panels.\n\nNew 10-core CPU\n\nM4 has a new up-to-10-core CPU consisting of up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores. The next-generation cores feature improved branch prediction, with wider decode and execution engines for the performance cores, and a deeper execution engine for the efficiency cores. And both types of cores also feature enhanced, next-generation ML accelerators.\n\nStory continues\n\nM4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over the powerful M2 in the previous iPad Pro.1 Whether working with complex orchestral music files in Logic Pro® or adding highly demanding effects to 4K video in LumaFusion, M4 boosts performance across pro workflows.\n\nGPU Brings New Capabilities to iPad Pro\n\nThe new 10-core GPU of M4 builds upon the next-generation graphics architecture of the M3 family of chips. It features Dynamic Caching, an Apple innovation that allocates local memory dynamically in hardware and in real time to dramatically increase the average utilization of the GPU. This significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.\n\nHardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to iPad for the first time, and enables even more realistic shadows and reflections in games and other graphically rich experiences. Hardware-accelerated mesh shading is also built into the GPU, and delivers greater capability and efficiency in geometry processing, enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. Pro rendering performance in apps like Octane gets a huge boost with M4, and is now up to four times faster than on M2.1 With these improvements to the CPU and GPU, M4 maintains Apple silicon’s industry-leading performance per watt. M4 can deliver the same performance as M2 using just half the power. And compared with the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a fourth of the power.2\n\nThe Most Powerful Neural Engine Ever\n\nM4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine — an IP block in the chip dedicated to the acceleration of AI workloads. This is Apple’s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of an astounding 38 trillion operations per second — a breathtaking 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic. Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI. And with AI features in iPadOS® like Live Captions for real-time audio captions, and Visual Look Up, which identifies objects in video and photos, the new iPad Pro allows users to accomplish amazing AI tasks quickly and on device.\n\niPad Pro with M4 can easily isolate a subject from its background throughout a 4K video in Final Cut Pro® with just a tap, and can automatically create musical notation in real time in StaffPad by simply listening to someone play the piano. And inference workloads can be done efficiently and privately while minimizing the impact on app memory, app responsiveness, and battery life. The Neural Engine in M4 is Apple’s most capable yet, and is more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\n\nAdvanced Media Engine for Smooth, Efficient Streaming\n\nThe Media Engine of M4 is the most advanced to come to iPad. In addition to supporting the most popular video codecs, like H.264, HEVC, and ProRes®, it brings hardware acceleration for AV1 to iPad for the first time. This provides more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.\n\nBetter for the Environment\n\nThe power-efficient performance of M4 helps the all-new iPad Pro meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and deliver all-day battery life. This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime.\n\nToday, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s six software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple’s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\n1 Testing was conducted by Apple in March and April 2024. See apple.com/ipad-pro for more information.\r\n2 Testing was conducted by Apple in March and April 2024 using preproduction 13-inch iPad Pro (M4) units with a 10-core CPU and 16GB of RAM.

        "title": "3 Underappreciated Stocks With Overlooked AI Potential",
        "content": "When it comes to generative artificial intelligence (AI), it’s paid off to stick with the mega-cap tech titans. Those are most notably the Magnificent Seven stocks. It’s likely that the cohort will hold the winner (or some of the winners) of the AI revolution. However, I think there are plenty of reasons to consider some of the non-Magnificent Seven companies. This is true especially while their AI potential is being undervalued by Wall Street. That’s where these underappreciated stocks come into play.\n\nIndeed, it’s easy to overlook the AI potential of the firms outside of the mega-cap tech spotlight. The Magnificent Seven are pouring tens of billions into generative AI initiatives. Furthermore, they seem to be sparing no expenses.\n\nThus far, we’ve gotten just a sample of what generative AI has to offer. In the next five years, look for such efforts to really start moving the needle. This will happen not just on share prices, but sales, margins, and, ultimately, profits. Here are three overlooked AI stocks that I believe investors are sleeping on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nReddit (RDDT) Silhouette man using smartphone with Reddit (RDDT) logo on blurred background is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NASDAQ:RDDT) reported its first earnings as a publicly traded company, and the results were impressive. Shares soared nearly 15% in the after-hours session to just shy of $57 per share. Indeed, the RDDT stock IPO boom and bust has come and gone. After an impressive showing, it seems like new entrants into the stock may be inclined to stick with the name for the long haul. This is true especially with the overlooked AI upside to be had in the social media firm.\n\nFor the March quarter, Reddit clocked in $243 million in revenue. This was up 48% year over year, comfortably ahead of the Wall Street estimates calling for closer to $214 million. Weekly active users soared 40% to 306.2 million. As a result, investors may wish to come for the growth and stay for the long-term AI prospects.\n\nData is a big deal when it comes to generative AI. And there is no better archive of people’s thoughts than Reddit. I view Reddit as sitting on a trove of invaluable data. This data can train the future’s most human-like conversational AI models.\n\nWith a $60 million-per-year licensing deal with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) to train Gemini, Reddit stands out as sporting one of the best datasets for firms seeking to train models. In a few years, count me as unsurprised if Reddit asks more than $60 million annually for its data. This is one of the most underappreciated stocks on the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a $200 billion semiconductor giant that I think could be every bit as magnificent as the Magnificent Seven. The stock is up a scorching 50% in the past six months, and new highs could be right ahead as the firm looks to find its way into the devices of an AI-enabled future.\n\nFellow InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel noted that QCOM stock is “a reasonably valued AI-hardware firm.” He also said that it has an “amazing track record.” Moadel is right on the money, in my opinion.\n\nAI on the cloud gets all the love these days. That said, it may not be too long before on-device AI chip makers get a boost. On Tuesday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) showcased some of its on-device AI capabilities with the M4 chip on the all-new iPad Pros. I was incredibly impressed and think more firms could follow in the iPad maker’s footsteps as consumers pay closer attention to neural processing units (NPU).\n\nQualcomm is no slouch, with the AI firepower in the Snapdragon X Elite’s NPU, which could give Apple’s Neural Engine a good run for its money as the next generation of hardware lands. You can see why this made our list of underappreciated stocks.\n\nDeere (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), a low-tech maker of tractors and other farming equipment. In recent years, the stock has gone flat, with some traders likely finished farming the stock (forgive the pun, please) for quick gains. Though the current agricultural cycle could stagnate for a while longer, I do think the next farming equipment boom could help reignite demand, the likes of which we may not have seen since late 2020.\n\nBelieve it or not, Deere has a tech team (Intelligent Solutions Group) that’s fully focused on advancing the technology in its equipment.\n\nOver the years, Deere has also bought up some intriguing firms, ranging from computer vision startups (Blue River Technologies) to autonomous driving firms (Bear Flag Robotics) and even human-in-the-loop innovator SparkAI. Given all that Deere stands to gain from its AI investments, I think it makes sense to call Deere an agro-tech company or, perhaps in a few years, an autonomous farming enabler.

        "title": "3 Sinking Stocks to Quickly Abandon Now",
        "content": "It has been a few volatile weeks for U.S. equities. After ending the first quarter of 2024 with significant gains, the S&P500 and Nasdaq posted some of their worst months in a while in April. These major indices fell 2.63% and 2.42%, respectively. This dip has led to investors reevaluating their portfolios to consider if there are any stocks they will want to sell now.\n\nMacroeconomic environment and the structural conditions within the market continue to make certain stocks untenable investments in the near and medium-terms. For one, trading multiples of U.S. equities in general are still pretty frothy. The macroeconomic data in coming weeks could still point to higher-than-expected inflation, placing bets on near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts further in doubt. Moreover, the U.S economy appears to be slowing based on recent Q1 data.\n\nWith that said, below are three sinking stocks to sell now as the market remains volatile.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cybersecurity space has been some of the most afflicted in terms of broader macroeconomic machinations. While many enterprises have moved a lot of data and services to the cloud, these same businesses have, in turn, demanded a holistic approach to cybersecurity. Cybersecurity stocks posted amazing returns in 2020 and 2021 for this very reason. The macroeconomic environment, unfortunately, has made enterprises to think twice about allocating costs to the implementation of new cloud security software.\n\nThis is where SentinelOne (NYSE:S) comes in. The cybersecurity firm’s “Singularity Extended Detection and Response Platform” leverages artificial intelligence to power cybersecurity solutions for an enterprise’s cloud network. Unfortunately, macroeconomic uncertainty has created headwinds for SentinelOne’s top-line growth, which slowed dramatically from triple-digit growth in 2021 and 2022 to mid-double-digit growth in 2023.\n\nSentinelOne’s share price has fallen 16% on a year-to-date basis. Increased competition from dominant cybersecurity player CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) could lead to further losses.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent news of Elon Musk’s trip to China and subsequent tentative approval of the Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) autonomous system caused the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s shares to rally 15% on April 29. Ultimately, Tesla will be able to improve operating margins a few percentage points, which is the implication that sparked the rally. However, waning demand in the global EV market still spells trouble for Tesla in the medium and long-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nElevated interest rates have created a waning demand environment for new vehicles, combustion engine and electric. First quarter Tesla earnings results missed revenue, gross margin, and profit estimates, underscoring the difficulty of the automotive selling environment.\n\nTesla shares have fallen 25% on a year-to-date basis. Once investors refocus on the downward spiraling EV market environment, TSLA shares could receive even more pressure. And, solidifying Tesla’s position as one of the stocks investors will want to sell now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\niPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently released its Q2 2024 earnings. And, despite various data points showing Apple’s decline in China, the tech giant remained optimistic on its long-term outlook. This optimism coupled with the largest share buyback program in the company’s history, $110 billion, sent shares soaring.\n\nLet’s first tackle the shareholder buyback point. When a company repurchases shares from shareholders, it’s usually at a premium to the current stock price and investors are satisfied. However, it’s important to note while these buybacks are great for large shareholders, benefits for smaller shareholders are minimal in comparison. In other words, retail investors may get a short-term boost in the value of their investment once a share buyback program is announced, but a lot of the gains are going to go to the big fish.\n\nThe market’s positive reaction to Apple’s earnings announcement is also puzzling for other reasons. Apple’s top-line figures still declined 4% on a year-over-year basis with iPhone sales falling 10%. The optimism that Apple’s management announced doesn’t seem grounded in the reality of the data coming out of China these days. As Bloomberg points out in an article, a number of independent industry research do not point to anything optimistic.\n\nHuawei’s continued rise will create additional headwinds for the iPhone maker. It just seems CEO Tim Cook’s optimism should be taken with a grain of salt and nothing more.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Sold These 2 Stocks, Even Though He Still Loves One of Them",
        "content": "We typically don't find out about the stocks Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) bought and sold until the company files its 13-F with the SEC. For the first quarter of 2023, 13-F filings aren't due until May 15.\n\nHowever, at Berkshire's widely followed annual meeting, Warren Buffett and his team revealed two stocks the company sold during the first quarter. This was a big contributing factor to the conglomerate's stockpile of cash growing to an all-time high of nearly $189 billion.\n\nThe two stocks were sold for very different reasons and had very different outcomes for Berkshire during their time in its massive stock portfolio. Here's what they were, and why Berkshire sold each of them.\n\nEven Warren Buffett doesn't only pick winners\n\nDuring Berkshire's Q&A session at the meeting, Buffett revealed that Berkshire had sold its entire stake in Paramount(NASDAQ: PARA). We don't know the exact selling price, but Berkshire owned 63.3 million shares of the entertainment company at the end of 2023, and based on the current stock price, Berkshire's investment would be worth around $816 million.\n\nSince early 2022, when Berkshire bought Paramount stock, it has fallen by 57%. PARA Chart\n\nBuffett revealed that the sale was \"100% my decision,\" and since Berkshire invested, Paramount has cut its dividend, lost a CEO, and generally disappointed investors. In short, streaming services like Paramount+ aren't profitable, and traditional cable and satellite TV services continue to lose subscribers.\n\nBuffett clearly decided that it was in Berkshire's best interest to cut its losses and move on. As Buffett has said, \"The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.\" And this is a perfect example of that principle.\n\nBuffett still loves this stock\n\nThe other stock Berkshire sold, and by far the larger of the two sales, is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The tech giant has been Berkshire's largest stock position for several years, and to be perfectly clear, that is still the case. In the third quarter, Berkshire sold roughly 13% of its stake in Apple, about 116 million shares, and they were sold at a big profit.\n\nAs with Paramount, we don't know the exact price Berkshire got for their shares. But based on Apple's share price at the end of the quarter, this translates to nearly $20 billion of proceeds for Berkshire.\n\nHowever, unlike with Paramount, Buffett made it clear that Apple is still one of his favorite businesses, and he suggested at the annual meeting that the sale was primarily for tax reasons. He could fear higher tax rates in the future, so selling some now could lock in today's rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett specifically named Apple as a stock that will probably remain a top holding of Berkshire, even after he's no longer running the investment portfolio. He called Apple an \"even better business\" than two of his longtime favorites, American Express(NYSE: AXP) and Coca Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\nWhat to watch\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks in most quarters in recent history, as Buffett has soured on certain companies and industries, such sas airlines and most banks, and generally has said it's difficult to find attractively valued opportunities. And thanks to these two moves, the first quarter continued this trend.\n\nAs a final thought, it's worth noting that these aren't necessarily the only stocks Berkshire sold during the quarter, and while we know from the recent first quarter earnings release that Berkshire was a net seller of stocks, there could be some buying activity within the portfolio as well. We'll get more details when Berkshire's 13-F is filed later this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple is developing its own chip to run artificial intelligence software in data centers, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple, which has been falling behind its competitors on AI, has been evading questions about its plans for the technology.\n\n\"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI and we're making significant investments,\" CEO Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview.\n\nThe project, internally codenamed as Project ACDC (Apple Chips in Data Center), aims to leverage Apple's chip design expertise for its server infrastructure, the report said.\n\nProject ACDC has been in the works for several years, but it is unknown if or when the project will be unveiled, according to the newspaper.\n\nFor Apple's server chip, the component will likely be focused on running AI models, also known as inference, rather than in training AI models, the report said.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.\n\nThe company has been closely working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to design and initiate production of such chips, the WSJ said, adding it remains uncertain whether both companies have yielded a definitive result.\n\n(Reporting by Angela Christy in Bengaluru; Editing by Varun H K)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. illegally interrogated staff at its World Trade Center store in New York City, the US labor board ruled Monday, marking the latest rebuke of the iPhone maker’s labor practices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Says a Cease-Fire Plan Backed by Hamas Falls Far Short At $2 Million Per Minute, Treasuries Mint Cash Like Never Before Ex-Trump Controller Says Cohen Repaid From Personal Account Jack Dorsey Leaves Bluesky Board, Calls X ‘Freedom Technology’ S&P 500 Extends Gains in Final Minutes of Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nA trio of Democratic-appointed labor board members ruled against the company, affirming the findings last year of an administrative law judge. In that decision, the judge concluded that the company violated federal law in 2022 by confiscating union flyers, prohibiting workers from placing them on a table in the break room and “coercively interrogating” employees.\n\nMonday’s ruling is the first decision against Apple by the NLRB’s members, agency spokesperson Kayla Blado said. The Cupertino, California-based company, which didn’t have an immediate comment, has previously denied wrongdoing.\n\nApple has faced a wave of organizing efforts over the past couple years, with employees at stores in Maryland and Oklahoma voting to unionize in 2022. Some other unionization petitions were withdrawn prior to voting, and other efforts — like the World Trade Center one — never got far along enough to seek a vote. The Maryland and Oklahoma stores haven’t yet reached collective bargaining agreements with the company.\n\nThe Communications Workers of America — the union behind the World Trade Center campaign and the Oklahoma win — said Monday that Apple continues to interfere with “workers’ ability to decide for themselves whether or not to join a union.”\n\n“Time after time, when workers want to join a union, Apple has had an opportunity to live up to its stated values and failed,” CWA spokesperson Beth Allen said in a statement. “This is why workers need an independent voice — to help Apple live up to its credo and make sure that every member of the team is respected and valued.”\n\nOther cases are still pending, including one in which an NLRB regional director accused Apple of illegally excluding unionized workers from certain benefits. Rulings by NLRB members can be appealed to federal court. The agency lacks authority to impose punitive damages or hold executives personally liable for violations.\n\nOn Monday, the NLRB members ordered Apple to “cease and desist” from coercively interrogating workers and confiscating union flyers from the break room. They also told the company to post a notice telling employees that it will obey the law and informing workers of their rights.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmployees at an Apple Store in Short Hills, New Jersey, are slated to vote Friday and Saturday on whether to become the third unionized site among the company’s roughly 270 US stores.\n\n(Updates with union comment in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChris Dixon’s Campaign to Overhaul Crypto’s Grifty Reputation The State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring AI Is Helping Automate One of the World’s Most Gruesome Jobs Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The economy is a feeling a touch blue — as seen through the lens of one of the world's largest tech players, IBM (IBM).\n\n\"Interest rates are higher for longer than most people supposed in the middle of last year. So as you take that into account, if interest rates are 2%, 3% higher for the five and 10-year (bond), then people thought that means all of the debt is going to carry an extra price,\" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Yahoo Finance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday.\n\n\"So I think CFOs are belt-tightening against that. Now, that's not systemic. That's not really secular, but it is a problem that's going to be there for a year or two,\" he added. However, he remains \"quite optimistic\" about the US and global economy.\n\nIBM's first quarter shed light on the mixed economic backdrop in the US as higher interest rates take hold.\n\nBig Blue's first quarter sales rose 1% from the prior year to $14.5 billion, falling just shy of Wall Street estimates. The company's lucrative consulting business saw sales unchanged amid more tepid corporate spending plans. Infrastructure sales declined 1% year on year.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $1.68 beat consensus forecasts by $0.08.\n\nThe company reiterated a forecast of constant currency revenue growth, \"consistent with its mid-single digit model.\"\n\nIBM did see momentum in its AI business, however.\n\nThe company revealed it had more than $1 billion in AI-related backlog. Krishna says companies are coming to IBM to unlock new productivity, with the economy being on the uncertain side.\n\nIBM's overall backlog increased 7% from a year ago.\n\n\"We view IBM’s Software and Consulting businesses well positioned for Hybrid Cloud and Digital Transformation growth ahead. However, we think the setup for the stock is challenging as investors weigh the potential for a global macroeconomic trough ahead and the company manages its way through the tail end of its most recent mainframe cycle,\" JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex said in a client note.\n\nIBM shares are up 4% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's 9% advance.\n\nThe enthusiasm amongst investors for all things AI rages on. But some of the excitement may be misplaced, former longtime Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers said in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy to Satisfy Your IRA Limits in 2024",
        "content": "2023 tax season has come and gone meaning it is time to consider 2024 contributions to your IRA. That will include some mix of Index and mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, and individual stocks. The maximum contribution in 2024 is $7,000 for those under 50 years of age and $8,000 for those 50 and older.\n\nWhile most investors will be primarily mixing funds and bonds many will also be picking individual stocks to add to their IRAs. How much money an investor dedicates to individual stocks within an IRA is largely a function of risk tolerance. Generally speaking, the higher that contribution, the more risk and reward it entails.\n\nThat said, let’s look at some of the better individual stocks to choose when considering IRA contribution limits in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is going to be one of the most popular large cap choices in an individual IRA in 2024. Many investors will have exposure to Microsoft through various index funds and ETFs. However, here we’re advocating for purchasing MSFT shares on an individual basis as part of an individual retirement account.\n\nFrankly, investing in Microsoft should be an easy choice. Analysts recommend purchasing Microsoft on a near unanimous basis. It’s generally expected that the value of those shares should rise by between 20% in a base case scenario and by as much as 50% should things rapidly improve.\n\nThere’s plenty of reason to believe in that best case scenario when one looks at the firm’s most recent earnings report from April 25. Revenues grew by 17% and net income increased by 20%. Thus, it’s entirely logical to believe that the value of the stock will rise by 20% moving forward. I like Microsoft because its AI fueled Cloud growth is a particular bright spot. Otherwise, investors should continue to consider Microsoft for its blend of growth and scale that has rarely been rivaled in the past.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealtyIncome (NYSE:O) represents an excellent individual stock choice within an IRA, especially for income-oriented investors. Each share includes a dividend yielding 5.6% paid as a monthly dividend. The beauty of a monthly dividend is that it includes three times as many distributions meaning greater opportunities to compound gains.\n\nRealty Income is also well-positioned defensively. Although the company is very retail oriented, it is highly recession resistant. The vast majority of its tenants operate in recession resistant sectors. That generally includes grocery stores, dollar stores, drugstores and other retail categories that tend to be non-cyclical in nature.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other thing to note about Realty Income is the structure of the leases it signs with its tenants. They tend to be longer, usually on the order of 10 years. Further, the triple net agreements place many of the cost responsibilities on the tenants themselves. That leaves more money for investors and shareholders in the end.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Close-up photo of hands holding glass Coca Cola (KO) bottles, clinking them together. One hand has a bottle opener and is opening a bottle.\n\nSource: BORIMAT PRAOKAEW / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will continue to show up on lists and articles discussing the best stocks to invest in. Whether it’s related to Warren Buffett or defensive positioning and anticipation of a weakening economy, Coca-Cola is generally well regarded.\n\nIt’s that ladder notion – a potential economic weakening – that bears discussion.  A lot of the issue centers around the ongoing fight against inflation. The Federal Reserve has not had as much success in the last few months as it would have liked. That leads some to believe that inflation will be much more persistent than initially believed.\n\nI believe Coca-Cola is uniquely positioned to benefit from that ongoing issue. First of all, Coca-Cola is one of the best defensive stocks there is. It tends to weather economic downturns better than the vast majority of the stock market. Further, consumers continue to buy Coca-Cola products despite higher prices brought on by inflation. In fact, the company raised its guidance for 2024 due to that fact. If inflation will indeed continue to prove more sticky than initially believed, Coca-Cola looks uniquely positioned to thrive regardless.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to deal with a period of stagnation and slowing sales. The news there isn’t all bad by any means. while Apple’s sales and earnings did decline on a year-over-year basis, each also bested guidance.\n\nApple decided to placate investor worries by increasing its share buyback program while simultaneously increasing its dividend by 4%. So, Apple is trying to introduce greater share price stability via more conservative means. The market seems to have appreciated the efforts. However, that is not the only reason to buy Apple at the moment.\n\nThe company remains tight-lipped about its AI plans. CEO Tim Cook is likely to divulge the details about Apple’s AI future at the firm’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June.\n\nThe best time to have invested in Apple would have been a few days ago before the share buyback announcement. However, all is not lost. Apple’s shares are strengthening again as it appears dedicated to stability. That, along with the potential for a price spike in June suggest that investors should buy in the interim.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s difficult not to like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock at the moment. Aside from the ever persistent threat of anti-monopoly litigation there’s very little to dislike. Amazon has largely avoided that threat for so long that it’s probably better to just ignore it wholesale. Instead, investors should focus on its earnings report and what it says about the company’s future.\n\nSales increased by 13%, rising to $143.3 billion. The company’s Cloud service – Amazon Web Services – continues to thrive. As good as those numbers are, the focus is really all about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company announced a generative AI based assistant intended to speed software development. That AI assistant should be particularly powerful from the perspective that it leverages Amazon’s AWS cloud. The company concurrently announced Bedrock, a fully managed AI service for quickly building and launching applications.\n\nThose developments –  along with strong results – suggest that Amazon is an excellent individual stock choice in any IRA.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to face a bevy of headwinds that have pulled its share prices lower by about 15%. Those headwinds include news that its Blackwell chips might ship later than initially anticipated, disappointing guidance from rival AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and ongoing concerns regarding when in 2024, if at all, rate cuts will occur.\n\nBuy it anyway because it is one of the best individual stocks to have in your IRA or otherwise. The simple fact remains that until another firm produces better AI chips than Nvidia does, there’s no reason to doubt the company over the mid and long-term. The artificial intelligence boom continues to be the greatest opportunity for investors of this generation.\n\nNvidia dominates demand for the chips that power the AI boom. However, Nvidia’s strengths extend beyond chips alone when it comes to AI. The company is rapidly moving into the artificial intelligence fueled humanoid robots sector. The Project GR00T foundational model is going to be an interesting theme to follow. Nvidia has clearly affected the data center space and may ultimately disrupt the entire economy down to the factory floor.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is arguably the best choice of the top three credit card stocks. Actually, if you follow the returns it’s inarguable that it’s the best. American Express has outperformed Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in 2023. That outperformance spans back more than 5 years and suggests that American Express will continue to outperform its rivals.\n\nThat logically begs the question of why American Express has been able to outperform other credit card stocks. My theory is that it relates to credit worthiness. American Express serves a higher income consumer base which is more credit-worthy. The risk of non-payments and defaults is much lower and as a result AXP shares simply outperform.\n\nFrankly speaking, any of the major three credit card stocks are good choices for the purpose of an IRA investment: each is relatively stable and well exposed to fintech growth opportunities. However, for all of the reasons I just discussed, American Express stands head and shoulders above the other two.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Other than tech stocks, investors also love dividends, as they can provide a nice buffer against drawdowns in other positions and a passive income stream.\n\nInterestingly enough, several tech stocks—Microsoft MSFT, Dell Technologies DELL, and Apple AAPL—reward their shareholders with quarterly payouts.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTech heavyweight Microsoft is coming off a recent double beat, with the company exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by nearly 5% and posting sales 2% ahead of expectations. Both items saw considerable growth from the year-ago period, with shares seeing buying pressure post-earnings.\n\nAnalysts have positively revised their earnings expectations across the board, with the trend notably bullish for its current fiscal year, up more than 9% to $11.76 over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has increasingly rewarded its shareholders, boasting a sizable 10.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple\n\nApple also recently reported quarterly results, bringing post-earnings fireworks. Concerning headline figures, the company posted a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales 1% ahead of expectations.\n\nUndoubtedly worthy of a highlight, the titan announced the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. Reflecting further positivity, Apple also unveiled a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.\n\nThe company boasts a 5.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDell Technologies\n\nDELL shares have been considerably strong year-to-date, up nearly 70% and crushing the S&P 500’s performance. Positive quarterly results have led the surge, with shares melting higher following its latest quarterly release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike MSFT, analysts have become notably bullish on the company’s current year outlook, with the $7.64 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up nearly 25% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares currently yield 1.4% annually, nicely above the average of the Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Undoubtedly pleasing investors, the company recently announced a 20% hike to its quarterly payout, reflecting its commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDividend-paying stocks don’t always have to be ‘boring,’ as many exciting companies from the technology sector also reward their shareholders with payouts.\n\nAnd for those interested in gaining exposure to the sector paired with quarterly payouts, all three stocks above – Microsoft MSFT, Dell Technologies DELL, and Apple AAPL – fit the criteria nicely.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Quantum computing is a space that leverages advanced computing techniques and quantum mechanics to solve problems that trouble conventional computers. This includes a variety of optimization applications, such financial modeling, weather and climate forecasting and traffic optimization. However, quantum computing still remains highly theoretically, and it will surely be some time before their use-cases expand beyond research and laboratories.\n\nThere are a number of quantum computing start-ups, such as IonQ (NYSE:IONQ), that have developed game changing technologies in the field. Unfortunately, given the amount of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment — elevated interest rates globally and persistent inflation pressures — investing in these pure-play quantum computing businesses is looking less and less like a viable option.\n\nBelow are three undervalued quantum computing stocks with a strong presence in the quantum computing space.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been researching quantum computing and employing the technology in cryptology since the early parts of the 21st century. In 2023, IBM continued to deliver fascinating finding. The company’s quantum computer was able to solve a complex physics question better than a conventional computer could. IBM’s Condor quantum processor reached new boundaries with 1,121 superconducting qubits, an industry achievement.\n\nIBM’s share price is now trading at 16.8x forward earnings, which is less than a number of tech giants in the space. In the past years, top-line growth has remained in the modest single digits. Investments in the quantum computing revolution could allow IBM to reap financial rewards in the future. This would, in turn, help boost revenue growth.\n\nFor investors desiring to bet on quantum computing, IBM still makes a solid choice among undervalued quantum computing stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another American tech giant with sizable exposure to the quantum computing space. The tech firm has been able to cross new boundaries with its Sycamore quantum computer. These days, Alphabet is more concerned with finding viable applications for quantum computing. In early March, Alphabet announced a $5 million reward to scientists who could research and develop practical applications for quantum computing.\n\nThe key reason Alphabet could be a great long-term quantum computing investment is the company’s Google Cloud product. Google Cloud is Alphabet’s main growth engine. Moreover, the tech giant has begun deploying quantum computing pow1er through its Google Cloud service. Offering quantum computing power through cloud services will not only make quantum computing more accessible but also foment the creation of practical applications for the novel technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet’s shares are trading at 21.6x forward earnings, which is also below tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell (NASDAQ:HON) is an industrial conglomerate with an advanced technological bent. The company has pursued the development of quantum computing technologies for some years now. In fact, Honeywell’s entry into the quantum computing space can be traced back to the formation of Quantinuum , which was the result of a business combination between Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum in 2021. Furthermore, Honeywell has invested $300 million into Quantinuum and owns a majority stake in the company. Quantinuum has been valued at $5 billion as of early 2024.\n\nBefore this business combination, Honeywell’s Quantum Solutions division had been breaking numerous barriers in the space. Successive breakthroughs are indeed possible. Honeywell’s stock trades at 19.4x forward earnings. For a quantum computing investment, Honeywell and its growth prospects in the space, makes it an enticing opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 25 richest billionaires in manufacturing industry. To skip our detailed analysis of the manufacturing industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Manufacturing Industry.\n\nGlobal Manufacturing Industry: An Analysis\n\nThe global manufacturing industry contributes massively to the world’s GDP. As per the data from the World Bank, global manufacturing accounted for nearly 16% of the world’s GDP in 2022. Manufacturing is involved in almost every industry. The US and China are two of the largest manufacturing countries in the world. According to a report by Deloitte, more than 200 new clean technology manufacturing facilities have been announced since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Approximately an investment of $88 billion has been made into the 200 new clean technology manufacturing facilities across the US. In addition, the manufacturing industry is boosted by the US CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act), which allocates almost $50 billion for the domestic semiconductor industry. Whereas, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) sets aside $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure in the US. Since the passing of the IRA, CHIPS ACT, and IIJA, annual construction spending has increased in the US. The annual construction spending in manufacturing was valued at $201 billion in the US, as of July 2023, reflecting a 70% increase year-over-year.\n\nThe changing trends in the manufacturing industry will have an impact on global manufacturing. According to a report by Oracle, the top industrial manufacturing trends in 2024 include technological investment, reskilling talent, reevaluating the supply chain, and building the factory for the future. Deloitte in its report mentions almost 86% of surveyed manufacturing executives believe that smart factory technologies will be the key drivers for competitiveness in the next five years.\n\nAccording to a report by Markets and Markets, the global smart manufacturing market was valued at $108.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $241 billion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 17.2%. Whereas, the global general manufacturing market was estimated at $726.3 billion in 2022. The market is projected to grow to $944.6 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 3.3%.\n\nThe manufacturing industry continues to face headwinds.

Manufacturing in Asia and Oceania recorded the highest year-over-year growth rate of 3.4% in Q4 2023. In comparison, the manufacturing output in Africa and Northern America was negative during the last quarter of 2023, dropping by 0.7% and 0.5% year-over-year, respectively.

        "title": "Top Research Reports for Apple, Linde &amp; Comcast",
        "content": "Monday, May 6, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Linde plc (LIN) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have lagged the Tech sector (-5.5% vs. +10.5%) and the broader market (-5.5% vs. +7.8% for the S&P 500 index) this year. But this trajectory appears to shifted materially following the iPhone maker's quarterly results and record buyback announcement.\n\nThe company’s Services segment is enjoying favorable momentum on the back of solid adoption of Apple TV+, Apple Pay and Apple Music. The updated MacBook and iMac lineup has helped Apple gain a share in the PC market.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Apple Vision Pro, a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world, has expanded Apple’s non-iPhone portfolio. The company’s strong cash balance and shareholder-friendly approach to dividends and share repurchase are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple has been suffering from stiff competition in the smartphone market and weakness in China. Growing legal complexities, including ongoing EPIC and Masimo lawsuits and the latest case by the U.S. Department of Justice, have been a headwind. Unfavorable forex is expected to have hurt fiscal second-quarter revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+15.9% vs. -11.4%). The company has an extensive range of industrial gas applications that are enhancing its global productivity day by day. The company supplies a wide range of gases crucial for various sectors like energy, steel, healthcare, manufacturing and electronics.\r\n\r\nLinde has long-term contracts with on-site customers, backed by minimum purchase requirements, ensuring stable cash flows. Its substantial backlog ensures earnings potential. The merger of Praxair and Linde has positioned the firm as an efficient player in the profitable industrial gas market, with a considerable size advantage.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising competition for new projects in emerging markets raises concerns. The decrease in U.S. industrial production is also expected to reduce the demand for industrial gases, thereby affecting profits. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>)\r\n\r\nComcast’s shares have declined -11.7% over the year-to-date against the Zacks Cable Television industry’s decline of -17.7%. The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the fourth quarter. Comcast has begun to deliver multi-gig symmetrical speeds in its DOCSIS 4.0 deployment. The technology is expected to help the company expand much faster and at a lower cost compared with competitors.\r\n\r\nRecovery in the theme park and movie business bodes well for the company’s profitability in the near term. Its streaming service, Peacock, is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband user base decreased in the reported quarter due to increasing competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. A leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ICICI Bank Limited (IBN), Xylem Inc. (XYL) and ResMed Inc. (RMD).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

The board authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, which represents a 22% YoY increase compared to last year’s authorization.\n\nFiscal Second Quarter Highlights\n\nRevenue dropped 4% YoY to $90.75 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $90.01 billion. Net income contracted 2% YoY to $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, while gross margin of 46.6% was in line with LSEG’s estimate.\n\nApple's revenue empire is undergoing a major restructuring.\n\niPhone sales tanked 10% YoY to $45.96 billion, while LSEG estimated $46 billion but CEO Tim Cook emphasized that these sales suffered from a difficult comparison as during last year’s comparable quarter, Apple realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues.\n\nMac brought in sales of $7.5 billion as revenue rose 4% YoY due to new MacBook Air models released with an upgraded M3 chip in March, exceeding LSEG’s estimate of $6.86 billion. iPad revenue tanked 17% YoY as it amounted to $5.6 billion, coming short of LSEG’s $5.91 billion. Other products brought in $7.9 billion, also falling short of LSEG’s estimate of $8.08 billion.\n\nA rare bright spot, services brought $23.9 billion to the revenue table, exceeding LSEG’s estimate of $23.27 billion as the segment continued to grow at a pace of 14.2% YoY.\n\nAn Unknown Outlook\n\nAlthough it did not provide an official guidance, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke of sales growth in the “low single digits” for the June quarter, while CFO Luca Maestri mentioned a double-digit YoY percentage growth in iPad saleswith services continuing to grow at about the latest reported rate. Apple is also due to announce new iPads in May that are expected to revive demand.\n\nWhat about AI?\n\nIt’s safe to say that there’s no tech company that hasn’t been heavily investing in generative AI over the past two years. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) decided to spend even more money on its development. With its latest earnings report, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that it will take years for Meta to start making money from AI. Fortunately, Meta has a good track record when it comes to monetizing its assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut, Apple is still being mysterious about its plans as generative AI didn’t make a big part of the earnings conversation. Once again, Cook only provided a teaser, perhaps somewhat bolder, saying that Apple has big generative AI plans that will differentiate it from its competitors. Hopefully, more about Apple’s AI roadmap will be revealed during its developer event in June.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Apple May Require a Gradual Strategic Shift to Maintain Growth",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the second-largest company in the world at the time of writing, and many investors are concerned the company may be past its high-growth stage. However, I believe the investment could still have a useful place in portfolios that are looking for good returns at a lower risk.\n\nMy own opinion on the stock over the long term is that it will certainly not contract in value in the next 10 years, but that its value accretion will be more moderate. Additionally, if management does not effectively shift the company's financial strategy to meet long-term growth opportunities and mitigate present growth risks, which are vastly different now compared to historically due to its size, Apple's stock could start to depreciate in value.\n\nApple might have to manage a strategy shift\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with SBSW.\n\nThere are valid concerns at the moment about how Apple's growth might slow down in the coming years due to how saturated its markets are. In addition, I believe that with the absence of Steve Jobs as CEO, the company could undeniably face issues in vision and technology development in the future. Even though I admire Tim Cook's management and believe Apple hosts some of the best talent in the world, it is leading that talent with an effective long-term vision which is paramount, and it is very difficult to match the late founder in this regard. I will discuss in the following sections how I believe Apple's negation of developing a real moat in artificial intelligence infrastructure is a mistake and that it may need to shift its focus away from consumer goods as its primary value-add to a higher focus on investment operations, similar to how Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) operates, with a strategy of portfolio management of technology companies that operate under the umbrella of Apple. I believe that a failure to do this could mean the firm eventually plateaus in growth and, over the next few decades, sees its share price depreciate as a result.\n\nWhile Apple's transition into services and its large moat in the app store is admirable, it is facing significant pushback from regulatory bodies for monopoly practices. I believe this is a bad reputation for Apple to be getting, and it also highlights a critical issue. The company is preventing innovative upstarts from flourishing through negative app store ecosystem payment rules, which are eating away at the potential earnings these newer players will depend on for their survival. Instead of investing in these companies, as I have alluded to would be wise in my analysis here, Apple is trying to capitalize off of them without necessarily astutely supporting their long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn essence, I think this is a bad strategy and is not conducive to long-term flourishment for Apple unless it changes its strategy somewhat. The tech giant has changed its commission structure for small developers, but I still think it could be more generous if it began a more thorough investment strategy, which could bolster long-term growth and open up its services and ecosystem for use in a more egalitarian way.\n\nAssessing Apple's valuation\n\nBecause Apple is the second-largest company in the world by market cap, there is very little room for inefficiencies in the valuation. As the GF Value chart indicates, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing. Recently, the company's valuation multiples have increased somewhat. However, this is warranted due to the fact its earnings growth rates without non-recurring items have been increasing over the past decade. Apple May Require a Gradual Strategic Shift to Maintain Growth\n\nThe main concern I have with the valuation is that, at the moment, it is still notably high, even if fair. I believe that if the company's growth reduces significantly over the long term because it fails to effectively pivot in a manner similar to my operations forecast above, the market could deem Apple's valuation a problem and begin a significant sell-off. After a potential significant correction, if the company is not managed with stock price growth in mind over the next decade, it could enter a new period of earnings contraction and share price depreciation. This is something we definitely do not want to see as shareholders, which is why Apple will have to focus carefully on its capital allocation strategies to maintain long-term growth in line with the broader economy as a baseline from here on out.\n\nDeeper analysis of market risks\n\nA significant slowdown in Apple's growth could occur if it ineffectively harnesses its acquisitions in AI to produce a moat in machine and deep learning capabilities, products and services. I believe that AI is going to absolutely transform the technology industry and will have far-reaching effects on every industry in the world. I believe it is a massive mistake for Apple to sideline AI or even outsource the most advanced tasks. Before his death in 2011, Jobs was involved in bringing Siri to the market through an acquisition led by Apple's leadership in 2010, which was arguably one of the first AI implementations in consumer technology. However, today, with the recent AI surge, which I posit was driven largely by OpenAI, Apple showed that it was not at the forefront of this innovation, but instead is having to adapt accordingly. Based on my analysis and research, the company wants to harness AI tools to create the best consumer goods rather than have a moat in any real sense in AI technology, tools or infrastructure. Its focus has been on deploying AI in its hardware and software ecosystems, with less noticeably visible offerings for consumers. To me, this is a mistake and will significantly negatively impact shareholder value over the long term as AI becomes the largest value-add in the modern technology industry in history.\n\nIn many respects, despite Apple's size, it is already behind on the AI front. Even considering its 25 acquisitions of AI companies from 2016 to 2020 and 32 AI startups being acquired in 2023, the question here is not acquiring the talent; it is what Apple does with the talent that is paramount. This reiterates my point that Jobs was known to be ruthless in the pursuit of technological excellence and vision. Without him, I believe the company's focus on consumer goods as its primary value-add could begin to wane over the long term. Its strategic shift to technology investments rather than fully integrated acquisitions could broaden its growth opportunities and allow for a deeper ecosystem of growth to strengthen it over the long term.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nApple may still be a big player in the game, but I believe it is quite telling that Microsoft has recently overtaken it. I think what Microsoft has over Apple, which is incredibly astute, is a business strategy that is similar to portfolio management but focused on technology. I believe this was instilled in Microsoft by Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio), and while I think Apple's consumer products have been the best in the world up until now, I think due to its size and the loss of Jobs, Apple's executive management has to navigate a shift in strategy to meet long-term financial growth targets that shareholders will want.\n\nIn many respects, Apple is at a critical crossroads and must navigate its future carefully. As such, I will hold the stock, but not at too high a weight in my portfolio until I see the shifts needed to maintain growth over the long term.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +8.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.12 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAPL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $82.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.8%. The $382.77 billion and $403.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.1% and +5.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $90.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.3%. EPS of $1.53 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.85%. The EPS surprise was +1.32%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nasdaq 100 e-minis climbed 64.25 points, or 0.36% while Dow e-minis rose 148 points, or 0.38%.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple dipped 0.3% premarket after the value of Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31, from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nParamount Global added 3.6% after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal, allowing the special committee to entertain other offers from rival bidders.\n\nPerficient jumped 53.2% after Swedish private equity firm EQT AB said it would take the U.S.-based digital consultancy firm private in an all-cash deal valued at about $3 billion.\n\nTyson Foods rose 2.4% after the meatpacker surpassed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit as it begins to reap the benefits of shutting some chicken processing plants to reduce costs.

        "content": "Wall Street was upbeat last week with the S&P 500 adding 0.6%, the Dow Jones gaining 1.1% and the Nasdaq advancing 1.4%. The benchmark U.S. treasury yield started the week at 4.63%, hit a high of 4.69% and ended the week at 4.50%.\n\nThe Fed’s plan to slower the balance sheet tightening process and the release of downbeat jobs data (which triggered bets over sooner-than-expected rate cuts) dragged down bond yields last week. The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in April, well below Wall Street expectations of 240,000. Health care and social assistance led the way with a gain of 87,000 jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate earnings have been bullish with Apple and Amazon coming up with both line beats. The corporate commentaries released throughout the week indicated the importance of AI growth and investments (read: ETFs to Tap Amazon's Q1 Earnings Beat, AI Growth).\n\nMeanwhile, crude oil ETF United States Oil Fund LP USO dropped about 6.2% last week on weak demand growth and less supply worries emanated from the Gaza-Israel peace talk.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best May dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Best May Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nWe are nearly halfway through 2024 and the market is showing stable performance. Though the S&P 500 fell by nearly 4% in April, the index surged by 8.12% this year so far and also recorded its biggest first-quarter gain since 2019. Analysts are also holding a positive stance about the market’s condition this year as they predict that earnings growth for the S&P 500 will pick up speed, reaching 9.7% in the second quarter, as reported by Forbes. They also expect that companies in the index will deliver an impressive 10.8% growth in earnings for the rest of 2024. In addition to this, dividend stocks are also showing a modest performance this year, with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index gaining 2.07% year-to-date.\n\nAlso read:\n\n12 Best Dividend Stocks with High Upside Potential\n\nRegardless of market conditions, investors consistently favor dividend stocks as they are known for generating regular income for them. Dividend growth stocks are especially important in this strategy because of their compounding effect and share price appreciation. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat Index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their dividends consistently for at least 20 years. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2024, the index produced a total return of 915.47% and a price return of 344.83%. The difference of 570.64% between the total return and price return is attributed to the dividends received over the period. The report further mentioned that the dividend growth rate of companies in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrat Index has also surpassed inflation over the long term. The index’s dollar dividends grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.96% from 2000 to 2023, exceeding the performance of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same period. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their dividends for decades and have delivered solid returns over the years. You can also take a look at\n\n16 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time.\n\nGiven investors’ inclination toward dividend stocks, companies around the world are increasingly adopting the strategy of growing their dividends steadily over time. Janus Henderson Investors reported that global dividends have grown from $1.24 trillion in 2017 to $1.66 trillion in 2023. The fund manager also expects global dividends to reach their all-time of $1.72 trillion in 2024, showing a nearly 4% growth on a headline basis. Analysts are also optimistic about dividend growth in the US. According to a report by S&P Global Market Intelligence, all 20 sectors within the US market are predicted to boost their regular dividend payouts this year, with an annual average rise of 6%. This growth is partially credited to companies that resumed dividend payments in 2023 following dividend cuts induced by the pandemic of 2020, and a few more are expected to follow suit in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile long-term investors like to hold onto dividend stocks for long-term gains, some aim for maximum returns in the short term through a strategy called dividend capture that involves purchasing a stock just before the dividend is distributed, holding it just long enough to receive the dividends, and then selling it. To learn more about this strategy, read our article Dividend Capture Strategy: 10 High Yield Stocks To Buy in November. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that are trading ex-dividend in May. 10 Best May Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in May 2024.

Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL)\n\nEx-Dividend Date: May 15\n\nPool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL) is an American company that distributes swimming pool supplies and equipment. The company reported a strong cash generation in the first quarter of 2024 with an operating cash flow of $145.4 million, up 41% from the same period last year.

The Company reported sales in their last quarter that declined -8% due to mild weather earlier in the year and after a few years of elevated sales driven by COVID-19 dynamics. We view these declines as transient and are not reflective of longer-term industry competitive dynamics. The Company continues to take market share in the North American pool care business and has maintained excellent profit and return metrics during this post-Covid digestion period. Pool Corp differentiates itself by carrying a large array of industry-specific products compared to mass-market retailers that carry more standardized products or smaller industry competitors that have less availability or narrower selections. This sweet spot positions Pool Corp well in the expanding pool care and development market and the Company should be able to drive double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.”\n\n6.

This can be seen as a relief for risk proxies,\" Christopher Wong, FX strategist at OCBC Global Markets, said in a note.\n\nU.S. stock indexes appear to have stabilized after a rocky April following some hotter inflation data, as a much better-than-expected first-quarter earnings season and hopes of U.S. monetary policy easing draw buyers back into the market.\n\nThe Fed last week left interest rates unchanged and signaled it was leaning toward eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but repeated that it wants to gain \"greater confidence\" that inflation will continue to fall before cutting rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and his New York counterpart John Williams are scheduled to speak later in the day, kicking off speeches from a host of U.S. central bank officials this week.\n\nKey data releases this week will include weekly jobless claims and U.S. consumer sentiment data for May.\n\nWith the earnings season in full swing, markets will watch out for quarterly numbers from major firms including Walt Disney , Uber and Arm Holdings later this week.\n\nOf the 397 firms in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings as of Friday, 76.8% have reported earnings above analyst estimates, compared with the long-term average of 66.7%, as per LSEG data.\n\nAt 07:19 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 123 points, or 0.32%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 17.25 points, or 0.33% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 41.25 points, or 0.23%.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple dipped 0.5% after the value of Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31, from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nParamount Global added 3% after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal, allowing the special committee to entertain other offers from rival bidders.\n\nPerficient jumped 52.3% after Swedish private equity firm EQT AB said it would take the U.S.-based digital consultancy firm private in an all-cash deal valued at about $3 billion.

        "content": "Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is more than just a search-engine provider. Indeed, with Baidu stock, you’ll get to participate in China’s counterpart to OpenAI’s artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a brilliant move when it invested in OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. In 2024, there are other popular generative AI chatbots besides ChatGPT. I encourage you to invest in Baidu.\n\nBaidu Isn’t Just China’s Google\n\nIt’s easy to pigeonhole Baidu as the Chinese version of Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google search engine. And I’ll admit, just as Google is Alphabet’s bread and butter, Baidu generates significant revenue from its popular search engine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, it’s not fair to pigeonhole Baidu in this way. For example, Baidu launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. Also, Baidu is an important AI-technology develop.\n\nIn fact, per The Wall Street Journal, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) “held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.\n\nFurthermore, Baidu recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Nissan Motor (OTCMKTS:NSANY) to conduct research on AI and “smart cars.” Not only that, but the agreement calls for Nissan to “equip its Chinese cars with Baidu’s AI products,” Reuters reported.\n\nBaidu’s AI Chatbot Achieves a Milestone\n\nClearly, Baidu is making its presence known as an AI-tech contender. Investors should keep an eye out for more partnerships, as the Baidu-Nissan MOU might only be the start of an ongoing trend.\n\nAdditionally, Baidu is quickly staking its claim as a gen-AI juggernaut in the company’s home country. U.S.-based stock traders might not be aware of this, but Baidu’s ERNIE Bot gen-AI chatbot is gaining serious traction in China.\n\nRecently, Baidu achieves a major milestone when its ERNIE Bot “amassed 200 million users.” That’s what I would call ultra-rapid growth, as ERNIE Bot debuted on March 16, 2023.\n\nThis is a perfect example of why U.S. investors should broaden their horizons. ERNIE Bot has a huge presence in China, just like ChatGPT does in America.\n\nThus, investigating investment opportunities abroad can alert you to new and interesting stock ideas.\n\nBaidu Stock: Grab This While It’s Still Cheap\n\nAre you seeking prime gen-AI exposure in your portfolio, but at a great price? Look no further.\n\nBaidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 12.94x, versus the sector median P/E ratio of 18.98x. Hence, there’s a terrific bargain that’s ripe for the picking.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s a shame that some American investors won’t take advantage of this. Maybe they’ve unfairly pigeonholed Baidu or they’re just not aware of the company.\n\nSo, feel free to grab some Baidu stock shares while they’re still cheap, as they’ll probably be much more expensive in a year or two.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The iPhone manufacturer lifted its dividend payments and unveiled a record share buyback program amid the steep decline in iPhone sales.\n\nBolstered by the increased dividend and stock repurchase commitment, Apple shares jumped as much as 8% in after-market hours, lifting its market capitalization by more than $160 billion. Investors seeking to tap the strength should consider ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Plenty of ETFshave Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nApple Earnings in Focus\n\nEarnings per share came in at $1.53, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and increasing from the year-ago earnings of $1.52. Revenues fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion but edged past the estimated $90 billion. Though revenue was hurt by a sluggish smartphone market and headwinds in China, higher-than-expected revenues demonstrate resilience (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\n\niPhone sales declined 10% to $45.96 billion, marking the steepest quarterly decline in iPhone sales since the pandemic’s outset. Services revenues, comprising iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple Care, rose 14.2% year over year to an all-time high of $23.9 billion. Revenues from Wearables, Home and Accessories, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV and Beats headphones, declined 10% to $7.9 billion despite the launch of Vision Pro. Mac sales rose 4% to $7.5 billion, while iPad sales declined 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is still struggling in China, with sales falling 8% year over year to $16.4 billion.\n\nFor the ongoing fiscal third quarter, the iPhone maker expects overall revenues \"to grow low-single digits\" and iPad revenues to grow in double digits. The company is planning a long-awaited push into generative artificial intelligence. On the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that generative AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, which is way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is gearing up for significant events that are expected to shape its future trajectory. A media event scheduled for May 7 is anticipated to unveil new iPad models and the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), starting Jun 10, is anticipated to provide AI-related announcements and insights into the company’s AI strategy.\n\nThe tech giant unveiled the largest buyback in the company's history. It has announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan and raised its cash dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index.

        "title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) posted its latest earnings report on May 2. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 31), the tech giant's revenue fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion but exceeded analysts' estimates by $190 million. Net income dipped 2% to $23.6 billion, but the company's $43.3 billion in buybacks boosted its diluted EPS by a penny to $1.53 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.03.\n\nApple's growth rates were anemic, but it boosted its quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.25 a share, which translates to a forward yield of 0.5%; and authorized a new $110 billion buyback plan, which is equivalent to 4% of its market cap. Image source: Apple.\n\nApple's stock rallied after the report, but it's only advanced about 8% over the past 12 months as the S&P 500 rallied 22%. Will Apple's stock head higher over the next 12 months, or will it continue to underperform the market?\n\nApple's three biggest problems\n\nApple faces three problems: declining iPhone sales (which accounted for 55% of its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2024), sluggish sales of Macs, iPads, and other hardware devices; and regulatory headwinds for its services business.\n\nApple's iPhone sales declined 10% year over year in the second quarter, compared to its 6% growth in the first quarter and 2% decline in fiscal 2023. Some of that slowdown can be attributed to the end of the 5G upgrade cycle, but it also faced macro and competitive challenges in China. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple's iPhone sales in China dropped 19% year over year in the first quarter of calendar 2024 as Huawei, Honor, and Xiaomi gained ground.\n\nApple's second quarter iPhone sales also faced messy comparisons to the prior year quarter, when it aggressively ramped up its shipments of higher-end iPhones to bounce back from its pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions. Excluding that one-time $5 billion boost to its sales last year, its iPhone sales would have grown year over year in the second quarter.\n\nApple's Mac sales rose 4% year over year in the second quarter, accelerating from its 1% growth in the first quarter and 27% decline in fiscal 2023. That recovery, which it attributed to the strong launch of the new MacBook Air, suggests the laptop and desktop PC markets are gradually recovering from their post-pandemic declines.\n\nThe company's iPad sales still fell 22% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2024 -- compared to its 3% decline in fiscal 2023 -- but it expects the business to finally return to double-digit growth in the third quarter. However, its Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue dropped 11% in the first half of fiscal 2024 as it struggled to sell more Apple Watches and AirPods.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's core growth engine was still its Services business, which grew 13% year over year and accounted for 22% of its top line. That marked an acceleration from its 9% growth in fiscal 2023. Apple expects its Services revenue to grow by the double digits in the third quarter, but antitrust regulators in Europe and the U.S. are trying to tear down that walled garden by challenging the company's policies regarding third-party payments and apps which directly compete against its first-party services. That pressure could reduce the stickiness of its services ecosystem, which already serves more than a billion subscribers.\n\nApple's plans are murky and its valuation is high\n\nApple plans to sell more iPhones in India and other emerging markets to reduce its dependence on China, but it could still face stiff competition from cheaper Android devices. Its Mac and iPad sales should gradually stabilize, but they won't curb Apple's dependence on the iPhone anytime soon.\n\nPlans for the future are also murky. The Vision Pro has gotten off to a sluggish start, partly due to its high price tag and lack of popular apps, and Apple recently scrapped its electric vehicle plans. It plans to roll out new generative AI features for its devices and apps, but that could be more a defensive move against its big tech rivals than an offensive one.\n\nApple expects its revenue to rise by the \"low single digits\" in the third quarter, while analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 1% and 7%, respectively, for the full year. For fiscal 2025, they expect 7% revenue growth and 9% earnings growth. Those growth rates are steady, but they're arguably not high enough for a stock which trades at 27 times forward earnings. Its low yield also won't attract any serious income investors.\n\nWhere will Apple's stock be in a year?\n\nApple will likely remain an attractive safe haven stock as long as interest rates stay elevated. But if interest rates decline, investors could pivot away from Apple's maturing business and buy higher-growth stocks instead. Therefore, Apple's stock might head higher over the next 12 months -- but it could struggle to outperform the S&P 500 and many of its peers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – May 6, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Nvidia NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\n\nMag 7 Leadership Reflects Earnings Power\n\nWith Q1 results from Apple and Amazon now out, we only have Nvidia’s results still awaited at this stage of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of companies. The sub-par growth numbers from Tesla and Apple notwithstanding, the Mag 7 group as a whole showed impressive top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\n\nIn fact, had it not been for the substantial earnings contribution from the Mag 7, Q1 earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.\n\nIt is interesting to note here that the market reaction to the Tesla and Apple releases has thus far been the best of the group. This may look odd since Tesla’s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple’s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn’t surprising as both companies’ results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple’s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.\n\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2024 Q1, the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 22.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\n\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +28.2% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 1200 companies reporting results, including 54 S&P 500 members. This week’s notable reports include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Shopify, and others.\n\nThrough Friday, May 3rd, we have seen Q1 results from 400 S&P 500 index members, or 80% of the index’s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 400 index members are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -2.2%, while the growth pace improves to +8.3% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.7% revenue growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> A Positive Earnings Picture Remains\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window)\n\n*\n\nFutures up: Dow 0.23%, S&P 0.26%, Nasdaq 0.23%\n\nMay 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Monday, pointing to more gains on Wall Street, as traders priced in a higher chance of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow closed at three-week highs on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in April, taking pressure off the U.S. central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nTraders are currently pricing in rate cuts worth 48 basis points from the Fed by the end of 2024, with the first cut seen either in September or November, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\nU.S. stock indexes appear to have stabilized after a rocky April, as a much better-than-expected first-quarter earnings season and hopes of U.S. monetary policy easing drew buyers back into the market.\n\nThe Fed last week left interest rates unchanged and signaled it was leaning toward eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but repeated that it wants to gain \"greater confidence\" that inflation will continue to fall before cutting rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and New York Fed President John Williams are scheduled to speak later in the day, kicking off speeches from a host of U.S. central bank officials this week.\n\nKey data for the week includes weekly jobless claims and U.S. consumer sentiment data for May.\n\nAt 5:44 a.m. ET, S&P 500 e-minis were up 13.25 points, or 0.26%. Nasdaq 100 e-minis rose 41.25 points, or 0.23%, while Dow e-minis climbed 88 points, or 0.23%.\n\nApple dipped 0.8% in premarket trading after the value of Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nParamount Global added 4.7% after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal, allowing the special committee to entertain other offers from rival bidders.\n\nPerficient jumped 54% after Swedish private equity firm EQT AB said it would take the U.S.-based digital consultancy firm private in an all-cash deal valued at about $3 billion.

        "title": "Even Worse than Gamestop? 3 Meme Stocks That Are Screaming Sells",
        "content": "You’ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE:GME) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it’s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.\n\nSo who is?\n\nQuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score, based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.\n\nThere are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which clocks in at 94. I won’t select it because I’m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity. Crap is crap.\n\nAnyway, this list of top meme stocks includes some names worth owning. I’ll save these for another time.\n\nImmunityBio (IBRX) Medical technology network team meeting concept. Doctor hand working smart phone modern digital tablet laptop computer graphics chart interface, sun flare effect photo, PTE\n\nSource: everything possible / Shutterstock.com\n\nImmunityBio (NASDAQ:IBRX) has a WallStreetBets score of 97, which means it gets a lot of chatter. Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.\n\n“ImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,” states the company’s investor relations site,” the company’s investor relations site states.\n\nDr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014. He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he’s worth $12.6 billion, up $2.1 billion in 2024.\n\nIf he’s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper — he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million — you don’t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.\n\nOne benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company’s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika’s shares are up 70% over the past month.\n\nWhile good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.\n\nThere was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor’s strategy of buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for his data analytics software business’s balance sheet wasn’t a terrible idea.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve’s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10%. Today, it’s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn’t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670. Today, it’s over $58,000.\n\nThe company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.\n\nIn February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn’t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn’t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.\n\nThe problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nUnlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.\n\nIf you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RMBL) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop’s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it’s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.\n\nThe good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you’re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year’s gains.\n\nThe gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG’s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports’ content on the Rumble platform.\n\n“I’m excited about Rumble’s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,” said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. “With the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.”\n\nIt all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn’t pay the bills.\n\nIn 2023, Rumble generated $81 million, which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.\n\nDon’t waste your money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple Has a Problem -- and Investors Should Love It",
        "content": "It's tougher than you might think to be a $2.8 trillion company. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) faces a more challenging task to continue the success of its past the bigger it gets.\n\nThe tech giant announced its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results on Thursday. One thing was evident from this update: Apple has a problem-- and investors should love it.\n\nApple's $162 billion problem\n\nWhy would anyone be pleased that a company they've invested in is facing problems? Some problems are good ones to have.\n\nThat's the story with Apple. The iPhone maker has too much cash on its hands. As of March 30, 2024, Apple's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $162.3 billion. To put that number into perspective, it's greater than the market cap of 450 members of the S&P 500.\n\nThis problem is great for investors because of the actions Apple is taking because of its massive cash stockpile. The company plans to transition to a net cash-neutral position over time, where its cash and debt are equal. With Apple's total debt at close to $105 billion and quarterly operating cash flow of nearly $23 billion, it has a lot of cash to spend.\n\nApple announced last week that it's increasing its stock buyback program by a whopping $110 billion. This is the largest share repurchase authorization in the company's history. The more stock Apple buys back, the more its remaining outstanding shares will be worth.\n\nThat's not all. Apple is also raising its dividend payout by 4%, its 12 consecutive annual dividend increase. In the six months ending March 30, 2024, the company returned over $7.5 billion to shareholders through dividends.\n\nA few not-so-lovable problems\n\nApple has a few other problems that aren't so lovable. The biggest is that the company's revenue fell 4% year over year in its fiscal Q2 to $90.8 billion. This decline is the result of contributing problems with several product lines.\n\niPhone sales sank nearly 10.5% year over year in the latest quarter to $45.9 billion. Around $5 billion of this negative trend was due to replenishment of channel inventory after COVID-related supply disruptions in the prior-year period.\n\niPad sales fell 16.7% year over year to $5.56 billion. The main culprit behind this decline was that Apple launched its M2 iPad Pro and the iPad 10th generation model last year.\n\nIt was a similar story for wearables, home, and accessories. Sales for this category slid 9.6% year over year to $7.91 billion primarily because of the tough comparisons with 2023 Q2 when Apple launched new version of its AirPods and Apple Watch.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolutions to some of these problems could be coming\n\nApple could have solutions on the way to some of these revenue problems. CEO Tim Cook said in the Q2 call Thursday evening the company will have \"an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love.\" He added that Apple's team \"can't wait to reveal what we have in store\" at the Worldwide Developers Conference next month.\n\nIt's a pretty safe bet that artificial intelligence (AI) will be at the heart of some of the upcoming announcements. Cook said, \"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era.\"\n\nI predict that Apple's AI innovations could kick off a new major upgrade cycle for iPhones (and maybe iPads, too). If I'm right, the company's sales should rebound in a big way. And I think these prospects, combined with the big stock buybacks and higher dividends, make Apple a stock investors can love again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Buffett Praised Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- At Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday, Warren Buffett heaped praise on Apple Inc. — after revealing he’d cut his stake in it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFrance’s Macron Calls for Reset of Economic Ties With China Everything Apple Plans to Show at May 7 ‘Let Loose’ iPad Event Berkshire Cash Hoard Scores Another Record as Earnings Gain Worsening Weather Is Igniting a $25 Billion Market The World’s Hunger for Salmon Is Linked to an Ecological Disaster\n\nBerkshire reported a $135.4 billion share in the iPhone maker at the end of the first quarter, down from $174.3 billion at the year end. The move quickly became one of the biggest topics as the meeting unfolded, even though Berkshire had sold some shares in Apple during the quarter before.\n\nDespite the sale, Apple is “even better” than American Express and Coca-Cola, which are “wonderful” businesses Berkshire also owns, Buffett told the crowd of thousands in Omaha. Unless something changes dramatically, Apple will remain its largest investment, he said, hinting that tax implications had motivated the sale. The iPhone may be one of the greatest products of all time, Buffett added.\n\nApple has faced a slew of headwinds — a $2 billion antitrust fine, slumping sales in China and the scrapping of a decade-long car project among them. Shares in the company are down about 5% this year.\n\nThe sale bolstered Berkshire’s cash pile, which climbed to a record $189 billion at the end of March. Given current market conditions — where rate cuts are uncertain, inflation remains elevated and geopolitical risks abound — Buffett said he didn’t mind amassing the cash and said it could reach $200 billion by the end of the quarter.\n\nThe cash hoard also benefited from higher interest rates, earning $1.9 billion of interest income compared to $1.1 billion during the same quarter a year prior.\n\nBerkshire’s cash pile has grown amid a dearth of sizable deals. Buffett said on Saturday he’s been unable to find recent acquisitions that would “move the needle” for the firm. Investors took it as a sign of his view on the stock market, too.\n\n“Buffett is hoarding cash and therefore is bearish on the stock market,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. “He is unlikely to apply those funds unless he has a chance to buy an entire company or there is a major market sell off of 30% or more.”\n\nHere are some other key takeaways from Berkshire’s annual meeting and earnings:\n\nEarnings Gain\n\nIn a sign the US economy remained robust at the beginning of the year, the conglomerate’s collection of businesses - which include manufacturers, home builders, insurance companies and retailers — generated $11.2 billion of operating earnings, a 39% jump on the prior year.\n\nStory continues\n\nImproved results at its insurance businesses helped the increase, earning $2.6 billion versus $911 million in the same period last year. At its auto-insurer Geico, pre-tax profits more than doubled to $1.93 billion, reflecting higher average policy premiums and lower claims, Berkshire said in its earnings statement. The business swung to profitability last year following several quarters of consecutive losses.\n\n“There’s still work to be done, but in the meantime, we are not going to shrink,” Buffett said of Geico.\n\nBerkshire’s railroad unit BNSF reported an 8.3% decline in earnings from the prior period, which Berkshire said was down to “unfavorable changes in business mix” as well as lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nClimate, Wildfires\n\nBerkshire’s PacifiCorp recorded $2.4 billion of estimated pre-tax probable losses from wildfires that spread across Oregon and California. About $1.7 billion of that remains unpaid, Berkshire said in its earnings report.\n\nPacifiCorp faces liability claims from the blazes, and damages sought by plaintiffs in Oregon and California totaled approximately $7 billion at the end of the first quarter, Berkshire said. At its annual meeting, Greg Abel — Buffett’s appointed successor and vice chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations — pointed to an additional claim for $30 billion that was filed last week, though he described it as “an incremental claim” to an existing lawsuit.\n\nThe absence of Charlie Munger, Buffett’s long-time business partner who died in November age 99, cast a pall over the meeting, which kicked off with a tribute film featuring a highlight reel of Munger’s famously acerbic one-liners.\n\nBuffett said the two had a “lot of fun doing anything” — he referenced golf and tennis — but they had even more fun “with things that failed, because then we really had to work, and work our way out of them.”\n\nAt one point, Buffett mistakenly called Abel “Charlie” when he turned to him, and answered a question from a young attendee about what he’d do if he had another day with to spend with Munger. Buffett answered that he would have spent it the same way as other days.\n\n“He went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99, but the world was interested in him,” Buffett said of Munger.\n\nSuccession\n\nBuffett referenced his own mortality throughout the day, as the question of succession arose repeatedly. The billionaire investor assured Berkshire’s shareholders that the company’s future was in good hands. Abel — who understands businesses “extremely well”— should take over Buffett’s capital allocation when he is no longer around, he said.\n\n“When you’ve got somebody like Greg and Ajit, why settle for me?” Buffett said, referring also to Ajit Jain, Berkshire’s vice chair of insurance operations. “It has worked out extremely well.”\n\nBuffett also kept invoking leadership changes at Apple, noting the strong leadership of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who took over for Steve Jobs.\n\n“Buffett made it very clear that the structure of the firm is in place,” said J. Dennis Jean-Jacques, founder and chief investment officer at Ocean Park Investments who first attended the meeting in 2000. “It’s going to become more important for shareholders to ensure the board of directors and managers keep the structure in tact — they are smart people and are not afraid to write to the CEO to let them know things are going wayward.”\n\nParamount Global\n\nBerkshire also sold its position in Paramount Global at a loss, Buffett said, adding that he was responsible for the investment. The company has faced challenges as viewers shifted from traditional TV to online offerings and is currently the subject of takeover talks.\n\n“I did it all by myself, folks,” Buffett said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe State of Crypto Is Anything But Strong AI Is Helping Automate One of the World’s Most Gruesome Jobs Why Banks These Days Are So Excited About Being Boring Will GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "title": "Disney steps up as Big Tech steps back: What to know this week",
        "content": "Over the last two weeks, investors were deluged by earnings, economic data, and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.\n\nIn the week ahead, the earnings flow will remain steady but slow down while the week's economic calendar should be among the year's quietest.\n\nOn Friday, investors cheered the April jobs report, which showed the US labor market growing at a slower pace last month, bringing the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this year back to the fore.\n\nCombine this report with strong earnings late Thursday out of Apple (AAPL), which became the latest Big Tech company to also boost its shareholder return plans, and all three major indexes finished the week in positive territory.\n\nEarnings expected in the week ahead won't include any members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" for the first time in three weeks. In their place, consumer and entertainment names will take top billing.\n\nResults from Disney (DIS), expected out Tuesday morning before the bell, should be the week's most closely watched report, as the media conglomerate is set to deliver its first quarterly earnings since winning its proxy fight with Nelson Peltz last month. Subscriber growth for its streaming services, parks attendance, and Disney's read on the summer box office will be key themes for investors.\n\nAs the parent company of ESPN, any commentary on the sports media landscape — in particular ongoing negotiations for the NBA's next media rights deal — will also be of note. Results from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), parent company of cable networks HBO, TBS, and TNT, later this week should pique investor interest along similar lines. Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger in attendance as the Los Angeles Clippers play against the San Antonio Spurs during the second half at Crypto.com Arena. (Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports) (USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Connect / Reuters)\n\nElsewhere on the earnings side, Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) will offer updates on the ridesharing business, Reddit (RDDT) will report its first quarterly results since going public, and consumer eating and drinking habits will get a checkup via results from the Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), Papa John's (PZZA), Celsius (CELH), and Krispy Kreme (DNUT), among others.\n\nThe economic calendar features little of note for investors, with Friday's preliminary look at consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan the only report of note. A handful of Federal Reserve officials are set to speak publicly over the next week, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell is not among them.\n\nFinding better balance\n\nNo news last week made a bigger impact on markets than Friday's jobs report.\n\nThe US economy added 175,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in April, fewer than expected. The unemployment rate also rose a tenth of a percentand annual wage growth slowed to 3.9%, its lowest level since June 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nJob growth slowing after a gangbusters start to 2024 and wage pressures appearing to ease were enough for investors to price in an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve as soon as September.\n\n\"The labor market is still healthy, and the Fed needs to see several months of benign inflation data before lowering rates,\" wrote Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n\"However, the April jobs report should help Fed officials regain confidence that inflation can get back to 2%.\"\n\nIn his press conference last week, Fed Chair Jay Powell noted, \"The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.\" Friday's report will affirm the chair in this view.\n\nStill, a softer employment report that takes pressure off the Fed should not be mistaken for a sign the US labor market is rolling over.\n\nRick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote in a note on Friday the US labor market's consistency has been \"remarkable\" over the last year, with three-, six-, and 12-month average job gains totaling 242,000, 242,000, and 245,000, respectively.\n\nRieder added that while he expects the pace of job growth to slow, \"some of the highest frequency measures of labor market health, such as separations, initial claims, etc., have moved sideways at low levels since March suggesting few signs of mass layoffs and a relatively healthy labor market.\"\n\nIf the first quarter of 2024 was defined by investors making peace with the idea rate cuts might be entirely off the table, the first month of the second quarter has been more positive for those investors clamoring for lower rates.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images)\n\nEarnings excitement\n\nAnd just like that, first quarter earnings season is just about done.\n\nThrough Friday, some 80% of the S&P 500 had reported results, with aggregate annual earnings growth coming in at 5%. At the end of Q1, investors expected earnings had grown 3.4% over the prior year, according to data from FactSet.\n\nAnd not only has this earnings season been better than expected for investors, but the typical pattern of analysts growing more cautious ahead of next quarter's earnings season hasn't held either.\n\nAccording to FactSet, analysts raised earnings estimates during April by 0.7%. In the first month of any given quarter, analysts have typically cut forecasts by an average of 1.9%. Earnings estimates typically fall during the first month of a quarter. But for the first time since 2021, estimates actually rose in April. (Source: FactSet)\n\nCompanies, of course, are more than happy with analyst habits to lower estimates during the quarter, making the eventual earnings \"beat\" a more manageable task.\n\nAnd given both companies and analysts are aware of the dynamics of this dance, that analysts aren't lowering estimates speaks to the positive fundamental story backing up this year's market rally.\n\nTake Apple, for instance.\n\nOn Friday, the iPhone maker's stock gained 6%. Its fiscal second quarter results reported Thursday were better than feared. And though the company reported another annual revenue drop, in the current quarter Apple expects revenue to rise by low single digits.\n\nAnd even more encouragingly for investors, CFO Luca Maestri told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton that sales in mainland China actually rose during the most recent quarter. Customers trying Apple's iPhone 15 series smartphones at the largest Apple flagship store in Asia in Shanghai, China, on March 23, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nWith investor community fears of Apple's position in China at elevated levels, and some alternative data suggesting an ugly picture for the company in Asia, Apple was asked by analysts how it squares these competing readings.\n\n\"I can't address the data points,\" CEO Tim Cook told investors. \"I [can] only address what our results are ... I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.\"\n\nA pointed, blunt assessment on how Apple views outside efforts to track its business.\n\nAnd the kind of message you will only hear in an environment where companies are emboldened to lean into discrepancies between their own numbers and outside estimates.\n\nAn environment in which it follows, then, that analysts won't be quite as quick as normal to pare their expectations.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEarnings: Palantir (PLTR), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Tyson (TSN), BioNTech (BNTX), Williams (WMB), Goodyear Tire (GT), Simon Property Group (SPG), Vertex (VRTX), Fidelity National (FIS), Air Lease (AL), Aaron's (AAN), Lucid (LCID), Coty (COTY), Hims & Hers (HIMS)\n\nEconomic news: No notable economic news.\n\nTuesday\n\nEarnings: Disney (DIS), Lyft (LYFT), Reddit (RDDT), Match Group (MTCH), Twilio (TWLO), Coupang (CPNG), Kenvue (KVUE), TransDigm (TDG), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Rockwell Automation (ROK), Ferrari (RACE), Crocs (CROX), BP (BP), Datadog (DDOG), Celsius (CELH), Rivian (RIVN), Electronic Arts (EA), IAC (IAC)\n\nEconomic news: No notable economic news.\n\nWednesday\n\nEarnings: Uber (UBER), Toyota (TM), AB InBev (BUD), Airbnb (ABNB), Arm Holdings (ARM), Fox (FOXA), New York Times (NYT), Icahn Enterprises (IEP), Hain Celestial (HAIN), Wolverine World Wide (WWW), Robinhood (HOOD), Instacart (CART), Bumble (BMBL), Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), AMC (AMC), Beyond Meat (BYND)\n\nEconomic news: MBA mortgage applications, May 3 (-2.3% previously)\n\nThursday\n\nEarnings: Roblox (RBLX), Unity (U), Warner Bros.

        "title": "The ending of Google's monopoly trial has Silicon Valley on edge",
        "content": "Google has a lot at stake as a federal judge weighs whether the tech giant’s search empire should be broken up.\n\nSo does the rest of Silicon Valley.\n\nA landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.\n\nGoogle's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, pushed back one more time with a claim the company has made from the beginning: \"Google is winning because it’s better,\" he said.\n\nA government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court on Oct. 30, in Washington, D.C., after testifying in the antitrust case against his company. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThat's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\nIn Apple’s case, US attorneys have alleged the iPhone maker blocked rivals from entering the smartphone market by using a “web of contractual restrictions.”\n\nA similar claim was made by the government in Google's case, which hinges on several types of contracts that Google allegedly used to cement its search dominance.\n\n\"The broad lessons here are a long way off, but this is clearly a really important time when the very first of these tech cases is going to be decided,\" said University of Washington antitrust professor Douglas Ross.\n\n\"I do think they're going to be interested in how narrowly or broadly [the judge] defines the markets here,\" Ross added, \"and if there is any learning in what he writes that might have application elsewhere.\"\n\nThe government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\nGenerally, Ross said, prosecutors are inclined to craft narrower market definitions to make it easier to prove a defendant holds a monopoly.\n\nHow courts react to those arguments, he added, will be significant.\n\nNew York University Law professor Harry First said the impact of Google's case also depends on the extent to which the judge accepts or rejects one of the government’s antitrust theories — that Google’s collective actions qualify as anticompetitive.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat strategy has been unsuccessful for the DOJ so far, including in its landmark case in the 1990s that eventually forced Microsoft (MSFT) into a settlement to open its operating system to competitors in the early 2000s. Amit Mehta, left, is the judge overseeing the Google antitrust case. Here he is pictured in 2012 when he was an attorney before the New York State Supreme Court. (DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images) (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\nBut if the judge in the Google case is persuaded that the theory has some merit, First explained, it could alter the way future antitrust cases are evaluated.\n\n\"I'm curious to see the extent to which the government tries to return to that theme and maybe move it in a direction that could be useful in other cases,\" First said.\n\nMany companies could be impacted by what the judge decides, even beyond the world of tech.\n\nA government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\nThe government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\nGovernment prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\nIn 2022, according to prosecutors, those payments totaled roughly $20 billion. The DOJ said its figure represented 15%-20% of Apple’s worldwide net income. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in April. (REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nSome tech companies, however, stand to gain if the government ultimately prevails.\n\nA breakup of Google’s contractual arrangements could boost rival search engines like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.\n\nIt could also open the door to newcomer search engines and mobile manufacturers.\n\nAmazon, for its part, exited the mobile phone market after Google's contracts allegedly prevented it from attracting manufacturers to its alternative operating system, Fire OS, a competing \"fork\" to Google’s Android operating system.\n\nProsecutors said manufacturers were concerned that Amazon's partnership with Bing for mobile search services would risk lucrative deals with Google.\n\nThe government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.\n\nThe outcome of November's presidential election could also impact the case, which was brought under former President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nIf Biden is defeated, a new administration could decide to pursue different remedies or drop the case altogether.\n\nThe judge in this case, Mehta, may or may not have tipped his hand in his final questions to the lawyers during closing arguments this past week.\n\nHe pushed back on arguments made by both sides.\n\n\"You can talk about competition, but the competitor bears some responsibility for competing,\" Mehta said while also questioning why new rivals were not pushing to enter Google's market — and whether that's even possible.\n\n“It seems to be very, very unlikely, if not impossible, under the current market conditions,” Mehta said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia: Billionaire Dan Loeb Is Betting on This Dividend-Paying Magnificent Seven Stock to Win the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race Instead",
        "content": "Many savvy technology investors and entrepreneurs agree: The AI revolution is the real deal, and will likely transform our lives in the years to come. But unlike other disruptive revolutions, this one should actually benefit many current incumbent technology giants. These powerful companies are, after all, the only ones with the massive financial war chests and diverse technology know-how to deploy this extremely expensive and difficult technology at scale.\n\nNo wonder the Magnificent Seven Stocks have taken off recently. But while AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) gets most of the attention, its stock has also taken off into the stratosphere and trades at a high valuation for a chip stock.\n\nThat's why billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is betting on one of the cheapest Mag Seven stocks as his new AI bet instead.\n\nThird Point Invests in Alphabet in Q1\n\nIn his first quarter letter to shareholders, Loeb detailed the firm's new buy of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) as a cheap way to play the AI race.\n\nIt should be noted that Loeb also said AI-related bets comprised about half of Third Point's holdings today. So, Loeb is clearly bullish on this powerful trend, which accelerated following the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that AI stocks rarely come cheap these days. But as Loeb spelled out in his Q1 letter, Google's initial missteps in the rollout of its large language model, Gemini, which seeks to compete head-to-head against ChatGPT, provided that window of opportunity.\n\nThe much-anticipated rollout of Gemini in February didn't go quite as planned. When prompted by early users to create historical images, Gemini often depicted racially diverse figures in historical settings in which it was not historically accurate to do so, and these politically charged inaccuracies were well-publicized. In response, Google's stock fell to a year-to-date low in early March.\n\nHowever, Loeb wrote in his letter:\n\nAssigning primacy to a small operational misstep while demoting the fact that the company has been building world-class capabilities in AI for over a decade, created an attractive entry point for a long-term investor. While it is easy to forget that the original paper on Transformers which paved the way for the rise of LLMs was published by Google engineers, and that it was Alphabet that built two of the leading AI research organizations (Google Brain and DeepMind), when news reports previewed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) intentions to embed Gemini into iOS, investors paid attention. We believe the moment when Gemini takes a seat at the economic table is approaching.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only does Loeb see Alphabet's AI team eventually working out the kinks in Gemini to make it a pre-eminent LLM, Loeb also notes AI has the potential to greatly enhance Alphabet's current core businesses across Search, YouTube, Android, cloud and others. And rather than being threatened by AI, Loeb thinks Google Search could actually become even more of a trusted source of information, as the post-AI internet becomes full of \"ad-supported content full of fakes.\" Dan Loeb bet on Alphabet in the first quarter 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bet pays off\n\nLoeb had good reason to expound on Third Point's Alphabet position in the first quarter. Five days before his letter came out, Alphabet reported first quarter earnings that handily beat analyst expectations. In addition, the company announced its first-ever dividend payment, which amounts to a 0.5% dividend yield at this stock price.\n\nThe dividend payment was interesting, as management showed confidence in its growth path while also giving a nod to the company's newfound focus on operational efficiency since the downturn of 2022.\n\nIn any case, Alphabet rallied higher following the April 25 release, and is now up about 20% on the year and roughly 25% from it March lows.\n\nHow Alphabet's stock looks after the rally\n\nEven after its recent rally, Alphabet trades at less than 26 times trailing earnings and just 21 times its 2025 earnings estimates. That's still among the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Not only that, but Alphabet also has a substantial $108 billion cash hoard, and it's still losing over $1 billion every quarter on its \"Other Bets\" segment.\n\nStripping out those two factors, and Alphabet's core Search, YouTube, Android, and Cloud businesses are trading at an even cheaper valuation than Alphabet's headline P/E ratio would suggest. In this Alphabet shareholder's opinion, investors would do well to follow Loeb into the stock for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

To be clear, we could certainly still see the economic \"soft landing\" that the Federal Reserve has been aiming for, but it's not a guarantee by any means.\n\nTherefore, it can be a smart idea to set your portfolio up with stocks that should do well regardless of what happens with the economy. With that in mind, of the roughly 40 stocks in my own portfolio, these are the two I'd worry about least if a recession were to arrive.\n\nAn incredible collection of assets that can win in tough times\n\nIf I could own only one stock, it would probably be Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). For one thing, Berkshire isn't just a single business. It's more like a diversified investment portfolio all in one stock.\n\nBerkshire owns more than 60 subsidiary businesses, including recession-resistant giants like GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and BNSF Railroad. It also has a stock portfolio worth more than $350 billion that includes massive stakes in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), American Express(NYSE: AXP), and several others, with most of the portfolio handpicked by legendary value investor Warren Buffett himself.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason I'm comfortable owning Berkshire even during bad times is its stockpile of nearly $168 billion in cash (as of Dec. 31). Even after the $30 billion Buffett insists on keeping in reserves, this leaves almost $140 billion that is currently earning billions in interest income but that could be put to work if opportunities arise. Berkshire's financial flexibility has allowed the company to make some great investments in bad economies -- including the highly successful Bank of America stake -- so a recession could ultimately be a net positive for long-term Berkshire investors.\n\nA boring business in the best possible way\n\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that specializes in freestanding properties, mostly occupied by retail and service businesses. And there are a couple of good reasons why it should hold up just fine in a recession:\n\nThe company specifically invests in properties occupied by recession-resistant businesses, such as discount retailers, drug stores, and quick service restaurants. It focuses on retailers that sell things people need, and that can potentially benefit when consumers are looking for bargains in tough times.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income is a net-lease REIT. This means tenants sign long-term leases (10 years or more), with annual rent increased built in. Plus, tenants agree to cover property taxes, insurance, and most maintenance costs. All Realty Income has to do is put a high-quality tenant in place and enjoy years of predictably growing income.\n\nThe proof is in the performance. Since going public in 1994, Realty Income has produced 13.9% annualized returns, handily outperforming the S&P 500. The stock also has a 5.6% dividend yield and has increased the monthly payout for 106 consecutive quarters, even during recessions.\n\nThese stocks can get volatile\n\nAs a final point, it's important to mention that while I think these businesses will be just fine, or do even better, during tough times, that doesn't mean their stock prices are completely immune from volatility. In tough markets, both can certainly have double-digit percentage swings in short periods of time.\n\nHaving said that, these are best suited as long-term investments, and are designed to be value-creation machines for decades. Any weakness caused by economic headwinds could be a great buying opportunity, but the bottom line is that these are stocks that should let you sleep soundly at night regardless of what is happening in the economy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and the biggest assembler of Apple's iPhone, reiterated on Sunday it expected a rise in second-quarter revenue, and reported record sales for the month of April.Foxconn said in a statement that this year's second quarter \"remains a traditional off-peak season, and major products are entering a period of transition between old and new products\".\n\nBut it added: \"The operations outlook for the second quarter is expected to show both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth\".\n\nThe statement did not elaborate and the company does not give numerical guidance.\n\nThe company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said April revenue reached T$510.9 billion ($15.83 billion), which it said was the highest figure on record for the same period and represented an on-year rise of 19%.\n\nRevenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, in April showed \"significant growth\" year-on-year, it said.\n\nStrong artificial intelligence (AI) server demand also delivered \"strong growth\" in April on-year for its cloud and networking products segment, the company added.\n\nThe monthly sales data comes ahead of Foxconn's first-quarter earnings call on May 14.\n\nFoxconn has previously reported that for the first quarter, revenue slid 9.6% year-on-year to T$1.322 trillion, underperforming a T$1.401 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.\n\nThe first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.\n\nApple's quarterly results and forecast beat modest expectations on Thursday, and CEO Tim Cook said revenue growth would return in the current quarter.\n\nIn March, Foxconn adopted a far more bullish outlook for this year, saying on its fourth-quarter earnings call that it expected a significant rise in revenue driven by booming demand for AI servers.\n\nFoxconn's shares have surged almost 50% so far this year, compared with a 13% gain for the broader market.\n\nThey closed up 1.3% on Friday.\n\n($1 = 32.2800 Taiwan dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. posted strong growth in April sales, potentially raising expectations for iPhone sales while AI-related business booms.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTruce Talks Shift to Qatar as Hamas Hits Israel Border Crossing France’s Macron Calls for Reset of Economic Ties With China Buffett Praises Apple After Trimming It, Drops Paramount Stake Everything Apple Plans to Show at May 7 ‘Let Loose’ iPad Event Worsening Weather Is Igniting a $25 Billion Market\n\nThe company, which assembles the majority of Apple Inc.’s smartphones, reported a 19% rise in monthly sales to NT$510.9 billion ($15.8 billion), compared with revenue of NT$429.2 billion in April 2023. It said in a statement Sunday that April revenue climbed to a record for the month.\n\nHon Hai, known also as Foxconn, makes most of the world’s iPhones but is diversifying to put greater focus on building datacenter server racks and other equipment for artificial intelligence clusters.

It posted a near-10% plunge in first-quarterly revenue in part because Apple’s flagship device underperformed.\n\nThe second-quarter remains a traditional off-peak season, and major products are entering a period of transition between old and new products, Hon Hai said in the statement. The visibility for the second quarter is approximately in line with current market expectations, with operations outlook for the period expected to show both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth, according to the statement.\n\nApple on Thursday surprised investors with a decent beat on quarterly revenue from China, defying a plethora of negative data points on iPhone sales. That discrepancy could be due to differences in the way independent analysts account for the business, or higher average sales prices than anticipated.\n\nInvestors scrutinize the company’s performance in China because of its role as both a huge market and global iPhone production base.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nHon Hai may face hurdles boosting its iPhone-related revenue in 2024 given 1Q’s downbeat demand and the swirl of unknowns clouding the broader picture. Despite being the iPhone’s largest producer, Hon Hai’s margins may be at increased risk from diminished scale economies within the iPhone business, and the steady capacity relocation to India.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Steven Tseng, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nIn the current period, Apple expects sales to climb by a percentage in the low single digits.

        "title": "Got $5,000? These 3 Growth Stocks Are Near Their 52-Week Lows",
        "content": "Buying growth stocks on the dip can be a way to lock in some great future gains. The current economy might not be ideal for all businesses, but in the long run, it is likely to recover. And amid that recovery, growth stocks as a whole should perform better.\n\nThree such stocks that investors have been feeling bearish about of late are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), and Prologis (NYSE: PLD). They are all trading near their 52-week lows, and if you have $5,000 you can afford to invest, here's why you should consider loading up on these stocks right now.\n\nApple\n\nAt around $175, Apple's stock has been rising of late, but it's still not far from its 52-week low of $164.08, and it's still down 9% year to date. It's trading at 26 times its trailing earnings, which isn't a steep multiple for one of the most valuable stocks in the world.\n\nInvestors have become concerned about iPhone demand. In China, a key market for Apple, sales have been falling during the early part of the year with consumers scaling back spending or buying cheaper options, including from Chinese rival Huawei.\n\nBut with more than 2 billion active devices, Apple already has a massive customer base. And while some consumers might be more hesitant to upgrade their phones right now because the economy isn't ideal, that doesn't mean sales will lag forever. Consumers could simply postpone upgrading their phones to help conserve cash.\n\nThey could also be waiting for a phone that includes the latest and greatest artificial intelligence (AI) features; generative AI capabilities are rumored to be coming to the iPhone 16 later this year.\n\nIt would be premature to worry about Apple's business. Its vast ecosystem and devoted user base make it likely that the company will continue to grow for years, particularly as it offers more services and becomes a bigger player in AI. For long-term investors, now can be an optimal time to buy the stock.\n\nStarbucks\n\nAnother company with a legion of devoted customers is Starbucks. Despite there being cheaper options for coffee, the chain continually pumps out strong numbers.\n\nStarbucks recently posted its second-quarter results, for the period ending March 31, and its consolidated net revenue of $8.6 billion was down 2%, which wasn't terribly bad given the current macroeconomic conditions, which are far from ideal for the business, with many consumers cutting back on spending. Its net income declined by 15% to $772.4 million. But in the long run, as economic conditions improve, Starbucks' numbers should recover.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe underwhelming results, did, however, lead to a sharp sell-off of the stock on Wednesday, sending it to a new 52-week low. While the near-term may look troubling for Starbucks, this is still a top restaurant chain to invest in for the long haul. Last year, the company announced plans to grow its number of stores from approximately 38,000 to 55,000 by the end of the decade.\n\nInvestors can also benefit from the stock's above-average dividend yield of 2.6%, which is higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.4%.\n\nPrologis\n\nPrologis is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that gives investors a great way to invest in e-commerce. As a leader in logistics, it invests in warehouses and helps companies grow their operations. Its customers include many big names, such as Amazon, PepsiCo, and Walmart.\n\nThe uncertainty of the current economic climate is likely weighing on the stock, which is down 22% this year. It's now less than $10 away from its 52-week low of $96.64. Prologis stock currently trades at an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ratio of less than 19, which is well below its five-year average of over 24.\n\nPrologis can be a good option for investors in the long run given the ongoing need for warehouses and logistics as the world of e-commerce continues to grow. In 2023, the company reported core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $5.61, which was 9% higher than the $5.16 it reported a year earlier. This year, the REIT projects core FFO growth of more than 9% again.\n\nIts financials are strong enough to support its dividend, which totals $3.84 per share over a full year. At 3.7%, investors can collect a dividend that's well above the S&P 500 average, giving them even more incentive to buy shares of Prologis.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 7 Stocks Make Up 84% of Warren Buffett's $336 Billion Stock Portfolio",
        "content": "Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), holds dozens of different stocks in its portfolio. But there is a high level of concentration at the top, with just seven stocks accounting for approximately 84% of its total holdings as of its latest quarterly report. And these companies can tell investors a lot about Buffett's broad, long-term strategy.\n\nStrong consumer brands at the top\n\nBuffett's top holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). It has long been one of his favorite stocks, with its popular products and strong customer base.\n\nBuffett loves great brands, and Apple has proved that it is among the best of the best. In the past, he's called Apple the \"best business I know in the world.\" In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated more than $100 billion in free cash flow.\n\nGiven his admiration for the stock, it's hard to imagine any other investment could take the top spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. At 40.3% of Berkshire's holdings, the iPhone and iPad maker is far and away the top position, even after a little trimming in the first quarter.\n\nAnother company that Buffett loves is Coca-Cola (he's often spotted drinking its products). Its strong brand has allowed the company to fight off the effects of inflation by passing along higher costs to consumers while still being able to generate growth.\n\nLast year, sales rose by 6%, and earnings per share were even more impressive, rising by 13%. At around 7.3%, Coca-Cola is the fourth-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, based on its value at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe final consumer goods stock within Berkshire's top seven is Kraft Heinz. Buffett has admitted in the past that Berkshire overpaid for the stock, but like Coca-Cola and Apple, it has been a fixture amid its top holdings. At 3.6% of the portfolio's total weight, it's barely hanging on to the No. 7 spot. It has many strong brands, including Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Jell-O.\n\nIn total, these consumer products companies account for a little over 51% of Berkshire's total portfolio, highlighting the value that Buffett places on companies with strong, iconic brands.\n\nFinancial stocks are a great way to bet on the economy\n\nHe is also fond of financial institutions and insurance companies, viewing them as a way to bet on the long-term health of the U.S. economy -- a good move, in Buffett's eyes.\n\nThe top two financial stocks in Berkshire's portfolio are Bank of America (11.7%) and American Express (10.3%). They are the largest holdings after Apple and account for right around 22% of the portfolio's weight.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America, one of the nation's top banks, is in a great position to benefit from a growing economy. And while there have been concerns with regional banks in the past few years, a top bank stock such as Bank of America provides a lot of long-term stability for Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBuffett loves credit card companies (Visa and Mastercard are in his portfolio as well), but Amex has an elevated status. Part of the reason could be that, like Apple, it caters to an affluent customer base, making it a safer option, especially amid a challenging economy.\n\nOil and gas stocks can add some important diversification during inflationary periods\n\nThere are also two stocks in Berkshire's top seven devoted to the oil and gas industry: Chevron (5.8%) and Occidental Petroleum (4.8%). Energy stocks can provide investors with some good returns amid inflation, and many of them -- like Chevron and Occidental -- also pay dividends.\n\nOver the past three years, these two stocks have generated market-beating returns, with Occidental surging 160% and Chevron rising by 58% -- far higher than the S&P 500's 22% gains during that time frame.\n\nFor investors worried about persistent inflation, or looking for a way to diversify, these are a couple of solid stocks within the oil and gas industry; both generate double-digit profit margins.\n\nShould your portfolio follow the Berkshire mold?\n\nBerkshire's portfolio has some good diversification among its top seven stocks. There are good reasons for investors to buy the same or similar stocks. Together, they can provide you with diversification, dividends, help in fighting inflation, and safety even in a challenging economy.\n\nIf you're not sure which stocks to buy, Berkshire's top seven can be a great place to start looking.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Queue the bears.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) cash pile hit another record high in the first quarter of $189 billion, the industrial giant said in its earnings release on Saturday.\n\nThat massive cash war chest will likely reach $200 billion by the end of the current quarter, Buffett told shareholders at a packed CHI Health Center today.\n\nSuch a hoard of greenbacks signals Buffett is “bearish” on the stock market right now, according to one veteran value investor.\n\n“Buffett is bearish on the stock market. He shows this by growing his massive cash position to $200 billion, selling Apple (AAPL) shares and saying that he doesn’t see bargains,” Smead Capital Management CIO and long-time Buffett watcher Bill Smead told me on the grounds of the Woodstock of Capitalism.\n\nBerkshire’s decision to reduce its stake in Apple and boost the company’s cash position is a move that Buffett says makes sense given the current macroeconomic environment.\n\n“I don’t think anyone sitting at this table has any idea how to use it effectively, and therefore we don’t use it,” Buffett said in response to a shareholder question of why Berkshire isn’t putting the cash reserve to work.\n\n“As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong” and you want to be able to “act when that happens,” Buffett added.\n\nApple and those other Buffett stocks\n\nThe bears have some meat to feast on, compliments of Buffett.\n\nBerkshire reduced its position in Apple by about 13% during the first three months of the year, marking the second quarter in a row that the conglomerate reduced its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nAs of March 31, Apple accounted for about 40% of Berkshire’s vast stock portfolio, worth a total of $135.4 billion.\n\nBerkshire reduced its position in Apple as the tech giant has struggled in recent quarters and valuation on the stock remains elevated. The stock fell about 10% during the first three months of the year, weighing on Berkshire’s quarterly results.\n\nWhile some initially looked at Buffett’s decision to reduce the Apple stake as a sign that his stance on the tech beast has changed, one analyst told Yahoo Finance that \"taking a little off the top doesn’t hurt.\"\n\n\"This does not concern us all that much because Apple was such a large position in the 13-F portfolio at the end of 2023, so anything to lessen that exposure is good from a diversification perspective,\" Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren told me at the meeting.\n\nThe legendary investor was also quick to reassure shareholders as to his confidence in Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\n“At the end of the year, I would think it’s extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have now,” Buffett told a packed house, which included Apple CEO Tim Cook. Harold and Caroline Ernst of St. Louis chat with fellow shareholders as they wait for the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting to begin on Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBuffett compared Apple to two of Berkshire’s most well-known, top holdings: Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP). While he called Coca-Cola and American Express “wonderful businesses,” he noted Apple was an “even better business.”\n\nWhile Buffett remains optimistic on Apple, the business does face short-term headwinds.\n\nWeakness in China has been front and center for Apple investors as it loses market share to domestic players. A more cautious US consumer hasn't aided investor sentiment, either.\n\n“It's easy to blame the overall consumer environment but there's also a market share dynamic that's occurring with Huawei and others becoming extremely competitive,” Ariel Investments emerging markets equities senior vice president Christine Phillpotts told me at Berkshire's annual meeting.\n\nIt’s a trend that Phillpotts says will likely accelerate as domestic players continue to “increase the value proposition.”\n\nApple shares have declined 4.8% since the start of the year despite coming AI announcements, far underperforming the S&P 500’s 8% gain.\n\nBuffett's cash hoard hints other stocks may follow Apple's lead lower as the year treks along.\n\nCurious on what Apple is up against in terms of AI competition?

        "content": "Warren Buffett, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, offered some insights Saturday at the company's annual meeting into the decision to reduce its stake in tech giant Apple, which was and remains its largest stock holding.\n\nBerkshire's stake in Apple fell by 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31 from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023, even as the iPhone maker's share price fell just 11%. The conglomerate appears to have sold about 115 million shares, or 13% of its holdings in the quarter.\n\nThe sale resulted in Berkshire realizing an $11.2 billion after-tax gain in the quarter from its sale of Apple stock and contributed to the rise in the company's cash holdings to a record of $189 billion. Despite Berkshire reducing its holdings in Apple, Buffett said he expects it to remain the company's largest stock investment.\n\n\"We have sold shares and I would say that at the end of the year I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett said. He went on to explain how he and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, viewed their stock investments in companies like Apple.\n\nBUFFETT RETAKES THE STAGE AS BERKSHIRE PREPARES TO PASS THE BATON Berkshire Hathaway co-founder and CEO Warren Buffett discussed the company's reduction of its stake in Apple.\n\n\"One interesting thing is that Charlie and I looked at common stocks or marketable equities or the things that people love to look at as being businesses, and so when we own a Dairy Queen, or we own whatever it may be, we look at it as a business. When we own Coca-Cola or American Express or Apple, we look at that as a business,\" Buffett explained.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"Now, we can buy really wonderful companies in the market as businesses — we can't buy all of their shares, we can't buy 90% or 80% or anything like that,\" he added.\n\nBuffett went on to say those companies and Apple are \"wonderful\" businesses and that Berkshire's assessment of those firms is such that they'll remain major holdings unless something dramatic occurs.\n\nWARREN BUFFETT PAYS TRIBUTE TO FRIEND, CHARLIE MUNGER AS 'ARCHITECT' OF BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY Buffett said that he believes Apple is a \"wonderful\" business that he expects will remain Berkshire's largest holding barring something unforeseen.\n\n\"We will own — unless something really extraordinary happens — we will own Apple and American Express and Coca-Cola when Greg takes over this place,\" Buffett said.\n\nLater in the question-and-answer session, Buffett cited Apple CEO Tim Cook's leadership as a reason for his confidence in the tech giant and said he has been a great successor to the late Steve Jobs.\n\nBuffett also touched on the tax consequences of selling Apple stock at this time when the capital gains tax rate is lower than it has been historically and said that it may be higher again in the future as the government looks to narrow the budget deficit. He also said that given alternatives in the market and uncertainty around the world, holding a larger cash stake is preferable.\n\nStory continues\n\nWARREN BUFFET BLASTS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN ANNUAL LETTER Buffett said that he doesn't mind the tax hit from Berkshire's sale of some of its Apple stock.\n\n\"I don't mind at all under current conditions building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available in the equity markets and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"Almost everybody I know pays a lot more attention to not paying taxes than I think they should. We don't mind paying taxes at Berkshire, and we are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking in Apple and that rate was 35% not too long ago, and it's been 52% in the past when I've been operating,\" Buffett said.\n\n\"It doesn't bother me in the least to write that check and I would really hope that with all that America has done for all of you, it shouldn't bother you that we do it and if I'm doing it at 21%, and we're doing it at a lot higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind that we sold a little Apple this year,\" he explained.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Buffett explains Berkshire's reduced stake in Apple at annual company meeting\n\nView comments",

        "content": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter profits plummeted along with the paper value of its investments, but the company said Saturday that most of the businesses it owns outright performed well.\n\nThe company reported reported a $12.7 billion profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in the quarter. That’s roughly one-third of last year's $35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share.\n\nThe figures were heavily influenced by a large drop in the paper value of Berkshire’s investments. Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the conglomerate’s operating earnings that exclude the investment figures. Operating earnings jumped 39% to $11.222 billion from last year’s $8.065 billion as its insurance companies showed strong results.\n\nOn a per share basis, this year's first quarter operating figure amounts to $7,796.47 per Class A share, beating three analysts' estimates by FactSet Research, who predicted $6,701.87 per Class A share.\n\nBuffett was a net seller of $17 billion in stocks during the quarter, including trimming about 13% of Berkshire’s massive Apple stake. At $135.4 billion, the iPhone maker still accounts for the biggest share of Berkshire's $364 billion portfolio. Buffett said he expects it to remain so even up to when his successor Greg Abel takes over.\n\nThe estimated value of Berkshire’s Apple stake suggests Buffett sold off more than 100 million shares. In the past, Buffett has said he invested in Apple’s stock because of how devoted consumers are to the company's products, similar to consumer brands he loves like Berkshire's own See's Candy.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who is at the Berkshire meeting, told CNBC that he still considers it a privilege to have Berkshire as a major shareholder, and he knew about the sales before Berkshire disclosed them Saturday.\n\nBerkshire reported a $2.6 billion underwriting profit at its insurers, up from $911 million a year ago, as Geico in particular continued to improve its results. However, BNSF railroad’s profits dropped 8% to $1.143 billion.\n\nMost of Berkshire's many other companies delivered solid results, including a 72% jump in operating profits at the utility unit, adding $717 million to Berkshire’s total.\n\nRevenue grew 5% to $89.87 billion in the quarter. The two analysts who reported estimates to FactSet predicted $87.044 billion.\n\nWith no major acquisitions in sight, Berkshire’s cash pile climbed to a record $188.993 billion even after it spent $2.6 billion repurchasing shares during the first three months of the year. Holdings including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and an assortment of dozens of others keep generating mountains of cash.\n\n“We’d love to spend it but we won’t spend it unless we’re doing something with very little risk that will make us a lot of money,” Buffett said.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett pays tribute to Charlie Munger on a 'tough day' for shareholders",
        "content": "A new vibe at the Woodstock of Capitalism.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting on Saturday marked a new era for the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. It’s the investing legend’s first without his right-hand man Charlie Munger, who passed away on November 28, 2023, just shy of his 100th birthday.\n\nWhile Munger’s absence is significant, his presence loomed throughout the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nCharlie Munger’s name was among the first words uttered by Buffett as he took the stage.\n\nBuffett described Munger as the “architect of Berkshire”, and his request to shareholders to “join me in applauding Charlie” was met with cheers and a standing ovation by a crowd that included the likes of Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup (C) CEO Jane Frasier and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.\n\n“In terms of having a partner, I simply cannot think of a conversation I had with Charlie that he misled me,” Buffett later told the packed house.\n\nBuffett added: “In terms of managing money, there wasn’t anybody better in the world to talk to for many, many decades than Charlie.”\n\nThe meeting started with a video tribute to the former Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which included a number of Munger’s famous one-liners from prior meetings, including “I think that, every time you saw the word EBITDA, you should substitute the word \"bulls**t\" earnings.”\n\nEBITDA is more formally known on the Street as shorthand for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Companies tend to hype the metric as a purer read on the health of the business rather than net profits.\n\n“It’s a bittersweet moment… a tough day for a lot of people,” new Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me of Munger’s absence. Berkshire Hathaway investment manager Ted Weschler, center, talks with Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan, Friday, May 3, 2024, in Omaha, Neb., one day ahead of the annual shareholders meeting. (AP Photo/Josh Funk) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSheridan’s message was echoed by executives of other Berkshire-owned companies.\n\nDairy Queen Executive Vice President Maria Hokanson described it as “an air of gratitude” and “a moment for us to reflect and celebrate his character and his wisdom.” Meanwhile, long-time See’s Candies CEO Pat Egan noted that Munger’s investment influence is evident in how Berkshire’s businesses operate.\n\n“He's still here in many ways… It’s about simplicity, doing the right thing, not overthinking things and taking care of the customer,” Egan said to me. See's Candies President & CEO Pat Egan talks with Warren Buffett at the See's Candies booth at the Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Meeting on Friday, May 3, 2024 in Omaha, Neb. (John Peterson/AP Images for See's Candies) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nEgan added: “You can't replace Charlie Munger. He's just an incredible, incredible presence and he's missed.”\n\nAs the meeting got underway, Buffett misspoke and called his successor Greg Abel “Charlie” when asking him to weigh in on a shareholder’s question. His mistake was met with cheers from the audience.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett was also quick to highlight Munger’s influence on Berkshire’s portfolio, telling shareholders BYD (BYDDY) and Costco (COST) were the two stocks Munger advocated for the most.\n\n“Charlie in all those years, only two times said “buy, buy, buy.” BYD was one of them and Costco was the other. Looking back, I should have been more aggressive in Costco. He was right, big time, in both companies.”\n\nBuffett and Munger’s unique and special partnership was evident when the Oracle of Omaha was asked what he would do if he could have one more day with Charlie.\n\n“Charlie liked learning. He liked a wide variety of things… We had as much fun, perhaps even more fun, with things that failed because then we really had to work out a way out of them,\" Buffett said.\n\n“It’s an interesting question,” Buffett added. “We never had any doubts about the other person, period… Charlie always said ‘just tell me where I’m going to die so I'll never go there.’ The truth is, he went everywhere with his mind, and therefore he was not only interested in the world at 99 but the world was interested in him. It’s remarkable.”\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith. Tips on deals, mergers, activist situations, or anything else?

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) reported first-quarter results on Saturday, and there's quite a bit to unpack. In addition to the headline revenue and earnings numbers, investors always watch Berkshire's cash stockpile, buyback activity, and the operating income from its subsidiary businesses.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a rundown of the key numbers, a major investment move that was revealed, and the important information we don't know yet.\n\nThe headline numbers (which don't mean much)\n\nWarren Buffett himself has cautioned investors not to pay too much attention to the company's net income (earnings per share, or EPS), as it includes unrealized investment gains and losses from Berkshire's massive stock portfolio. That's especially true for the first quarter, as an excellent first quarter of 2023 resulted in an EPS decline of 64% -- even though Berkshire's business performed quite well, as we'll see in the next section.\n\nBerkshire's revenue grew by 5%, and it's worth noting that both the top and bottom-line numbers came in significantly higher than analysts had been expecting.\n\nOperating earnings paint a better picture\n\nBerkshire's operating earnings tell us how the company's subsidiary businesses are performing, and these look great. Overall, Berkshire's operating earnings grew by 39% year over year.\n\nMuch of this strong performance was due to the insurance business. Underwriting income nearly tripled year over year, and investment income grew by 32%, mainly due to the rising interest rate environment over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway Energy operating earnings rose by 72% year over year. The only significant decline was an 8% year-over-year drop in BNSF Railroad's operating earnings, but the rest of Berkshire's business more than made up for it.\n\nIs Buffett souring on Apple?\n\nOne of the most important things investors should know about Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports is what isn't revealed.\n\nSpecifically, while Berkshire reports the cost basis of its massive stock portfolio from quarter to quarter, we generally don't know what stocks Berkshire bought or sold (with few exceptions) until its 13-F is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This quarter's filing is due on May 15, so we'll get an updated snapshot of Berkshire's portfolio as it stood on March 31.\n\nHowever, Berkshire reports the market value of its largest stock positions as of the end of the quarter. Judging by these, it appears that Berkshire unloaded about 13% of its massive Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) investment during the first quarter. This would certainly explain the rapid growth in the cash stockpile, as well as the realized investment gains of $11.2 billion Berkshire mentioned in its earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuybacks accelerated in the first quarter\n\nBerkshire's buyback activity is always of interest to shareholders, as it provides insight into whether Buffett thinks the company's stock is attractive. While a price below intrinsic value is a requirement for buybacks to take place at all, the pace of buybacks has varied widely over the past few years.\n\nThe first-quarter earnings report shows that Berkshire spent $2.6 billion on buybacks, including both Class A and Class B shares.\n\nFor context, Berkshire repurchased $2.2 billion of its shares in the fourth quarter of 2023 and spent $9.2 billion throughout the entirety of last year. So, the first quarter represents a bit of an acceleration.\n\nBerkshire's cash hoard hits a new record\n\nAt the end of 2023, Berkshire's cash stockpile soared to an all-time high of $167.6 billion. Simply put, Buffett has found it difficult to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in recent years, and with short-term Treasuries yielding about 5% on Berkshire's idle cash, Buffett is in no rush to pull the trigger.\n\nTo say that Berkshire's cash hoard grew in the first quarter would be an understatement. Including cash, equivalents, and short-term Treasury Bills, Berkshire now has a staggering $189 billion on its balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the earnings report was released on the morning of Berkshire's widely followed annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The meeting includes hours of Q&A with Warren Buffett and the heads of Berkshire's insurance and non-insurance operations, so there's likely to be some new information (and investment wisdom) shared throughout the day. We may even find out why Buffett sold a significant amount of Apple.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Just Released Its Second-Quarter Results And Analysts Are Updating Their Estimates",
        "content": "It's been a good week for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest quarterly results, and the shares gained 8.3% to US$183. Apple reported US$91b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.53 beat expectations, being 2.1% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, Apple's 42 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$387.1b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$6.57, approximately in line with the last 12 months. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$387.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.54 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$202. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Apple at US$250 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$125. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.\n\nOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Apple's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 2.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 9.8% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 5.9% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have forecasts for Apple going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nThat said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

Berkshire also reduced its massive stake in Apple during the first quarter by about 13% to 790 million shares, Barron’s calculates, based on information in the Berkshire 10-Q report released in conjunction with the earnings.

        "title": "23 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 23 most profitable stocks of the last 12 months. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.\n\nThe United States stock market has come a long way since the turn of the millennium more than two decades ago. Emerging from the dotcom boom and bust without permanent damage, the economy has faced the financial meltdown of 2008, a tech-enabled boom that has resulted in trillion dollar valuations, and the pandemic crisis of 2020 that ground business to almost a complete halt across the globe. From 2003 to 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has registered double digits annual returns thirteen times.\n\nInvestors at the stock market have made money from this growth by piling into profitable stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, even as these tech stocks become the hottest equities, old-school value investing has yet to lose charm. Value investors who like to invest in profitable companies with high gross margins and net income have made shrewd investments in businesses with a solid track record over these twenty years. For example instead of NVDA, we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times market value excluding cash and investments using the value investing approach.\n\nThe present condition of the stock market is better understood in the context of a recent research report by investment advisory Deutsche Bank. The report underlines that the seven biggest companies in the S&P 500 now have a combined market capitalization that make these firms the second biggest stock market in the world, almost double the size of the Japanese market that is in fourth position. Jim Reid, the head of global economics and thematic research at the advisory, has warned that this makes the US market most concentrated in history.\n\nThe fortunes of these firms are set to rise even further as AI hype and rate cut expectations serve to increase interest in growth stocks. Businesses are investing heavily in AI tools to keep pace with industry demand in this regard. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), recently highlighted the role that he expected AI to play in changing work trends in the coming years and months. He made these comments during the second quarter earnings call at the end of January.\n\n“A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo select stocks for this list, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify companies with high gross margins and net income. The Finance Charts database was then used to identify firms with the best net income growth in the past twenty years. The analyst ratings of each stock are also discussed to provide readers with some context for their investment choices. The hedge fund sentiment around each stock was calculated using the data of around 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 23 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years\n\nAn overhead view of a bustling stock exchange, with brokers and traders exchanging stocks.\n\nMost Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years\n\n23. Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 49\n\nNet Income: $452 Million\n\nFair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO) develops analytic, software, and digital decisioning technologies and services that enable businesses to automate, enhance, and connect decisions.

Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO): FICO is a leader in predictive analytics and decision management software and is also the provider of FICO credit scores. FICO reported solid 4Q results, with revenue beating expectations, partially mitigated by a slight shortfall in EPS. Total revenue sustained low-double-digit growth in the quarter, with Scores up 12% year-over-year and Software up 11%. Software annual recurring revenue growth accelerated to 22% year-over-year in 4Q from 20% in 3Q. FICO also guided to double-digit revenue and EPS growth in fiscal year 2024.”\n\n22. ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 44\n\nNet Income: $500 Million\n\nANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) develops and markets engineering simulation software and services worldwide. On March 5, investment advisory Rosenblatt maintained a Neutral rating on ANSYS, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ANSS) with 585,625 shares worth more than $212 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Conestoga Capital Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS): ANSS is the gold standard in selling computer-aided engineering (CAE) software that allows engineers to simulate how product designs will behave in real world environments before they are manufactured. Shares rose sharply at the end of the year on rumors that it was in talks to be acquired by Synopsys (SNPS), a leader in electronic design automation (EDA) software.”\n\n21. IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nNet Income: $845 Million\n\nIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) develops, manufactures, and distributes products primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, dairy, and water testing markets. On February 6, investment advisory JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) stock and raised the price target to $630 from $600.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based firm Fundsmith LLP is a leading shareholder in IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) with 2.7 million shares worth more than $1.5 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Conestoga Capital Advisors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDXX): IDXX is the industry leader in providing instruments (and consumables) used in diagnostics, detection, and information systems for veterinary, food, and water testing applications. Earnings for the quarter were mixed, as IDXX revenue came in lower than expected on weaker veterinary clinic traffic. However, pricing came in better than expected and shares rebounded after a significant drawdown from July highs.”\n\n20. Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nNet Income: $1.4 Billion\n\nRoper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) provides software, engineered products and solutions. On February 5, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) stock and raised the price target to $596 from $580.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 38 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.1 billion in Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP), compared to 42 in the previous quarter worth $2.4 billion.\n\n19. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 42\n\nNet Income: $1.6 Billion\n\nMonster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of energy drink beverages and concentrates in the United States and internationally. On February 29, investment advisory Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 42 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.4 billion in Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), the same as in the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.\n\n18. Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 56\n\nNet Income: $1.6 Billion\n\nMoody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) operates as an integrated risk assessment firm worldwide. On February 14, investment advisory UBS maintained a Neutral rating on Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) stock and raised the price target to $380 from $355.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Nebraska-based investment firm Berkshire Hathaway is a leading shareholder in Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) with 24 million shares worth more than $9.6 billion.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, L1 Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyse Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”\n\n17. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nNet Income: $1.7 Billion\n\nPaychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a New York-based company that provides human resource, payroll, and other services to businesses. In late December, investment advisory Stifel maintained a Hold rating on Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) stock and raised the price target to $130 from $124.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Select Equity Group is a leading shareholder in the firm with 2.3 million shares worth more than $281 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Ensemble Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”\n\n16. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\n\nNet Income: $1.9 Billion\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a real estate investment trust that owns and runs self-storage facilities. On March 7, investment advisory Jefferies maintained a Buy rating on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock and raised the price target to $331 from $315.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $678 million in Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), up from 24 in the preceding quarter worth $1.4 billion.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)  was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the most recently reported quarter, business results for Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.”\n\n15. Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\n\nNet Income: $2.3 Billion\n\nSimon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is a real estate investment trust engaged in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations. On February 28, investment advisory Evercore ISI maintained an Equal Weight rating on Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) stock and raised the price target to $150 from $142.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 27 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $320 million in Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG), the same as in the preceding quarter worth $240 million.\n\nJust like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) is one of the most profitable stocks of the last 12 months.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&P Global Inc. gave back some gains from earlier this year due to investor concerns that rising interest rates will weigh on future debt issuance and asset-based fees. Management also removed its 2026 revenue target for the ESG segment due to a more uncertain regulatory landscape and political climate. On a positive note, S&P Global reported strong second quarter financial results, with 7% adjusted revenue growth and 11% EPS growth as ratings issuance returned to growth for the first time in six quarters.

We continue to own the stock due to the company’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”\n\n14. Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nNet Income: $2.3 Billion\n\nMicrochip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) develops, manufactures, and sells smart, connected, and secure embedded control solutions in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. On February 2, investment advisory Needham maintained a Buy rating on Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) stock and raised the price target to $90 from $85.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Sydney-based investment firm Platinum Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) with 1.5 million shares worth more than $141 million.\n\nIn its Q3 2023 investor letter, Weitz Investment Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.”\n\n13.

(NASDAQ:ADI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the semiconductor industry, demand is closely tied to the economic cycle, and industry order patterns are magnified by its complex supply chain. Furthermore, it’s a capital and technology intensive industry, resulting in frequent overcapacity and product obsolescence. For these reasons, we shied away from any investment in the industry for many years. However, several years ago, we felt that segments of the industry had developed strong enough moats to merit investment under the right conditions. We made one investment (Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) in Large Cap) that we thought was compelling, but it wasn’t until late 2021 when the semiconductor industry entered a severe downturn, that we began purchasing semiconductor stocks in earnest. Our view on the cycle risk was simple – the long-term growth outlook was tremendous given the proliferation of electronics and software in everyday objects, and the downturn had already begun, and a healthy amount of it was known. We ignored the near-term outlook for profits, assuming they would be down substantially. It turned out that the downturn was more severe than most other investors or industry observers had forecasted. Thus, semiconductor stocks in general remain depressed, and our investments have so far shown mixed results.\n\nHowever, we have not changed our view on the long-term attractiveness of the industry segments in which they operate, nor on the normalized earning power of these companies five to ten years out. Thus, we have been consistently adding to our exposure for the past two years, which, in addition to Analog Devices, now includes Microchip Technology (Mid Cap), MKS Instruments (Mid Cap), and Texas Instruments (Large Cap), the last of which was a new purchase in 2023. Each of these has wide and deep moats, top-notch management teams, and strong secular growth prospects. We expect our investments here to ultimately work out for us, but they are examples of how unpredictable, cyclical factors can overwhelm other factors in the short term.”\n\n11. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nNet Income: $3.6 Billion\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a biotech firm that develops therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is one of the most profitable stocks of the last 12 months.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, Aristotle Atlantic Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) develops drugs for treating cystic fibrosis, cancer, inflammatory bowel, autoimmune disease and neurological disorders. The biotechnology company has four commercial drugs used to treat cystic fibrosis. Vertex has other drugs in development, including additional cystic fibrosis treatments and medications addressing sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and pain.\n\nVertex is the global leader in treating cystic fibrosis and has additionally built a robust pipeline in several therapeutic areas. Late-stage studies in acute and neuropathic pain are expected to be another catalyst for the company. We believe Vertex’s valuation is attractive and at a discount relative to their 5-year historical average. Additionally, the company is well capitalized, with roughly $12.5 billion in net cash on its balance sheet.”\n\n10. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

(NASDAQ:GILD) with 3.8 million shares worth more than $312 million.\n\nIn its Q4 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) stock and raised the price target to $48 from $46.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared to 64 in the previous quarter worth $1.6 billion.\n\nHere is what Oakmark Funds has to say about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 12 Months.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDividend Contenders List Ranked By Yield: Top 25 13 Best Mining Stocks To Buy Now 11 High Growth Micro-Cap Stocks to Buy\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAs Big Tech goes on its spending spree, building out its infrastructure for the coming AI wave, Apple continues a shift of its own.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which make up around half of the company’s revenue, have been declining, and Thursday’s quarterly report showed another 10% drop in sales.\n\nBut the company’s quarter was well received thanks, in part, to its services business, which has emerged as a bright spot and the source of continued profit margin growth for the world’s second-biggest company.\n\nThe Services segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV+, and Apple Music, saw revenue growth of 14% in the company’s second quarter.\n\nAnd as CFO Luca Maestri noted on Thursday evening’s earnings call, these gains, along with some cost cutting, were instrumental in boosting the company’s gross margins to 12-year highs of 46.6%, up from 45.9% in the prior quarter.\n\nAs our Chart of the Week shows, the company has been boosting its margin profile, to use analyst speak, for years.\n\nEfficiency emerged as a fresh new theme for tech after last year’s shift to profitability and leanness following the industry’s post-pandemic, talent-grab bulking phase.\n\nAnd now, at least in one part of the sector, growth mode is back as AI spurs an investment boom.\n\nOn Apple’s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook punted on any AI announcements and told investors next to no detail about plans or spending.\n\nThe general idea, though, is that they are indeed spending less than their Magnificent peers.\n\nWhich, as Evercore analysts wrote Thursday, investors should appreciate as “Apple executes on AI in a more capital efficient manner vs. other tech companies.” Spending less to make more, hopefully, unlike, say, Meta.\n\nAnd perhaps this is part and parcel of the company’s AI strategy, which has been nothing if not consistent with the company’s longtime philosophy not to rush into a product category. Rather, Apple has preferred to be a thoughtful late adopter, unbowed to trends.\n\nComputers, MP3 players, phones, tablets, headphones, VR headsets. Most were successes for Apple; all were “late” relative to the competition.\n\nUnlike the brute power of investment its peers are pouring into AI, Apple’s services business relies on the company’s shiny brand and walled-garden ecosystem.\n\nWe’d expect Apple’s pending AI strategy to capitalize on this approach, continue fostering the company’s margin boom that has defined its last few years of corporate life, and set the company apart from its peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "Apple’s China sales tell a different story than what analysts have heard for months. Where is the disconnect?",
        "content": "Are the iPhone’s best days in China behind it?\n\nThat was the big question going into Apple’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday. By the time the call concluded, Apple’s stock price was up more than 6%, and CEO Tim Cook had repeatedly enthused about his “great view” on Apple’s business in China.\n\nBut despite Wall Street’s positive reaction to Apple’s results (helped by a massive stock buyback announcement), questions about the iPhone’s standing in China may only have become more complicated in the wake of the latest earnings. The company’s surprisingly better-than-expected results in China, and the disparity from what several prominent independent research firms had predicted, reveals a disconnect involving one of the most important pillars of the $2.8 trillion company’s business.\n\nGreater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is Apple’s third largest region by revenue, representing 19% of Apple’s total sales during the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nAs tensions between the U.S. and China have increased over the past year, demand for American tech products, including iPhones, has fallen among Chinese consumers. Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies like Huawei are making headway on new smartphones and guzzling the market share Apple is losing. The Chinese government has supported this shift toward domestic technology, last year ordering state officials to stop using non-Chinese phones for work.\n\nApple’s revenue in the region has declined on a year-over-year basis in five out of the six most recent quarters, and all signs pointed to more pain in the first three months of 2024.\n\nIn the beginning of the year, Apple’s weekly shipments into China declined by 30% to 40% year over year on a weekly basis, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, a renowned TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate insights into Apple’s business.\n\n“This downward trend is expected to continue,” he wrote in a January blog post. “Apple may have the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024,” he said.\n\nFor the quarter, market research firm Counterpoint estimated Apple’s iPhone sales in China were down 19% from the same time last year.\n\nIt turns out that Apple sales in Greater China did indeed decline in the first three months of the year, coming in 8% below levels a year ago. But that decline was far less severe than Wall Street had been bracing for: Compared with the 13% decline in the fourth quarter of 2023, it was actually an improvement. Sales of iPhone, Apple said, actually increased in mainland China during the quarter (though it didn’t specify if the increase was from the previous quarter, or the previous year).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe surprise was enough to prompt multiple questions from analysts during their call with Apple executives. As one analyst on the call bluntly put it: “What are we missing?”\n\nTo that, CEO Tim Cook wouldn’t give an answer, saying he couldn’t address numbers that Apple didn’t produce. “I can only address what our results are,” Cook said. “I can’t bridge to numbers we didn’t come up with.”\n\nCook said that the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro Max were the two bestselling phones in “urban China” during the quarter, and he recounted the “warm and energetic” reception he received from consumers in Shanghai when he visited and opened a new store in March.\n\nWhat’s really going on inside China\n\nIt isn’t immediately clear why Apple’s numbers aren’t more closely aligned with the independent research.\n\nBetween quarterly earnings reports, Wall Street analysts rely on independently collected data to gauge how a company’s business is faring. These research reports can include anything from supply-chain information to retail store inventory levels, gleaned from both official sources and leaks from insider contacts. While this data can’t tell the full story, it does give analysts a strong impression of what’s going on.\n\nBut the disparity between the third-party research reports and Apple’s report in Q1 left many investors and observers scratching their heads.\n\nApple reports revenue for China, while many industry analysts look at unit shipments, creating some room for divergence if prices change. Cook’s comments about the newer iPhone 15 models, including the 15 Pro Max, being top sellers in urban China suggests that the company may have benefited from higher prices even if overall units were down more sharply.\n\nWill Wong, an analyst at IDC, which had projected a 10% unit decline in China iPhone sales, told Bloomberg that different methods of measuring pricing may have prompted some of the confusion.\n\n“IDC counted the street prices (i.e., the prices that consumers paid), while Apple is likely using another price level, such as factory price, in its financial report,” Wong was quoted as saying.\n\nFollowing the earnings call with Apple executives, many of Wall Street’s equity research analysts appear to have sided with Apple’s version of the story. Analysts have largely revised their models to reflect a more favorable China business, according to their research notes published on Friday. Bank of America analysts called the China concerns “unfounded,” while analysts from investment firm Wedbush said they expect to see China sales turn a corner by June and show growth by September.\n\n​​“The worst is now behind Apple in China,” Wedbush analysts wrote.\n\nApple’s overall revenue declined 4.3% to $90.8 billion during the quarter, which is better than analysts expected. Apple also beat earnings per share predictions, meeting last year’s number at $1.53. Executives announced its largest stock buyback of $110 billion, an increase from the $80 billion to $90 billion repurchase Apple has offered in recent years.\n\nBut some analysts remain cautious. While the independent research reports may not have aligned with Apple’s results in China, UBS analysts noted that the iPhone clearly appears to have lost market share in China.\n\n“Peak China units of 50M in FY 22 is also not likely to be repeated given 300-500 [basis points] of share loss in that region,” UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a note to investors on Friday, stressing that Apple is not “in the clear yet.”\n\nUBS, which has a neutral rating on Apple, doesn’t expect the company to sell many more iPhone 16 devices, which are expected to premiere in September, than iPhone 15s. This sentiment is partly because of lost market share in China, the firm said.\n\nAnd even as Cook talked up China during Thursday’s call, the company also appeared to be laying the groundwork for a future where China was less vital to its business. CFO Luca Maestri noted that other “emerging markets” like India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Turkey, and Indonesia were getting larger and in aggregate nearing the size of China.\n\n“The gap as you compare it to China is reducing, and hopefully that trajectory continues for a long time,” Maestri said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Along with its Magnificent Seven peer Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPLhighlighted a week that saw a nice rally in broader markets after Fed Chair Jerome Powell dismissed the possibility of rate hikes on Wednesday.\n\nAdding momentum to the market, Apple was able to exceed quarterly expectations for its fiscal second quarter yesterday evening and announcied an increase in its dividend and stock buybacks.\n\nQ2 Financial Highlights\n\nRevenue records in more than a dozen countries helped Apple post an all-time high for Q2 EPS at $1.53 which edged estimates of $1.51 a share and rose a percentage point from the comparative quarter. Canada, Latin America, and the Middle East were some of the international segments that saw record growth with Q2 sales of $90.75 billion beating estimates by 1% despite decreasing from $94.83 billion a year ago.\n\nNotably, Apple has exceeded top and bottom-line expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDividend Increase & Stock Buybacks\n\nApple’s board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases given continued confidence in its business as the tech giant aims to be cash-neutral. Additionally, Apple will be raising its dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share (quarterly) and is planning for more annual payout increases going forward. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectory\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, Apple’s annual earnings are now expected to be up 6% in fiscal 2024 and are projected to rise another 8% in FY25 to $7.10 per share. Total sales are forecasted to be virtually flat this year but are projected to rise 5% in FY25 to $403.72 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nApple’s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, Apple appears to be pushing past domestic monopoly concerns and regulatory issues in China by expanding in other foreign markets although there could still be better buying opportunities ahead.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "With Q1 results from Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN now out, we only have Nvidia’s NVDA results still awaited at this stage of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of companies. The sub-par growth numbers from Tesla TSLA and Apple notwithstanding, the Mag 7 group as a whole showed impressive top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\n\nIn fact, had it not been for the substantial earnings contribution from the Mag 7, Q1 earnings growth for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be in negative territory.\n\nIt is interesting to note here that the market reaction to the Tesla and Apple releases has thus far been the best of the group. This may look odd since Tesla’s Q1 earnings were down -53.4% from the year-earlier level on -8.7% lower revenues, and Apple’s earnings and revenue growth rates were -2.2% and -4.3%, respectively. But it isn’t surprising as both companies’ results proved better than what market participants had feared. We also need to keep in mind the impact of Apple’s blockbuster buyback announcement, the largest ever in history.\n\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its March-quarter results on May 22nd, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +49% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth performance in the context of what we saw from the group in the preceding quarter and what is currently expected for the next three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s growth picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe charts below show the aggregate earnings and revenues for the group on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.9% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 21.2% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2024 Q1, the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 22.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\n\nThe chart below shows the group’s earnings contribution to the index over time and what is currently expected for the next two years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership.\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +28.2% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 1200 companies reporting results, including 54 S&P 500 members. This week’s notable reports include Disney, Uber, Lyft, Shopify, and others.\n\nThrough Friday, May 3rd, we have seen Q1 results from 400 S&P 500 index members, or 80% of the index’s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 400 index members are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +4.2% higher revenues, with 78.3% beating EPS estimates and 61% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.3% from the same period last year on +4.3% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nThe chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2024 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you likely know already, the Tech and Energy sectors are having the opposite effects on the aggregate growth picture. Excluding the Tech sector, Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -2.2%, while the growth pace improves to +8.3% on an ex-energy basis.\n\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.9% on +1.7% revenue growth.

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif., May 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apple Inc. has released the following notice:\n\nA Federal Court authorized this Notice. This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.\n\nTO: ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO OR WHICH HELD SHARES OF APPLE INC. (“APPLE” OR THE “COMPANY”) COMMON STOCK AS OF THE CLOSE OF TRADING ON APRIL 29, 2024.\n\nTHIS NOTICE RELATES TO THE PENDENCY AND PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF YOU ARE A CURRENT APPLE SHAREHOLDER, THIS NOTICE CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS.\n\nTHIS ACTION IS NOT A “CLASS ACTION.” THUS, THERE IS NO COMMON FUND UPON WHICH YOU CAN MAKE A CLAIM FOR MONETARY PAYMENT. IF YOU DO NOT OBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OR THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE, YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO TAKE ANY ACTION.\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to inform you of: (i) the pendency of the shareholder derivative action brought on behalf of Apple Inc. (“Apple” or the “Company”), styled as In re Apple Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, Case No. 4:19-cv-05153-YGR (the “Federal Action”) , pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division (the “Federal Court”); the shareholder derivative action brought on behalf of Apple pending in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara (the “California Court”), styled as In re Apple Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 19CV355213 (the “California Action”), and a factually-related litigation demand on Apple’s board of directors (the “Demand” and, together with the Federal Action and California Action, the “Actions”); and (ii) a proposed settlement of the Actions (the “Settlement”), subject to approval of the Federal Court.\n\nThe terms of the settlement are set forth in an Amended Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release dated April 29, 2024 (the “Amended Stipulation”).1 This notice should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the text of the Amended Stipulation, which has been filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. A link to the text of the Amended Stipulation and the full-length Notice of Pendency and Proposed Settlement of Shareholder Derivative Actions may be found on the “Investor Relations” section of Apple’s website, investor.apple.com.\n\nUnder the terms of the Amended Stipulation, as a part of the proposed Settlement, Apple will adopt and/or implement corporate governance reforms, which are attached as Exhibit A to the Amended Stipulation (“Enhancements”).

Plaintiffs’ Counsel will apply to the Court for service awards of $5,000 (“Service Awards”) to each of the Plaintiffs to be drawn from the Fee and Expense Amount.\n\nA Settlement Fairness Hearing will be held on July 16, 2024 at 2:00 p.m., before the Honorable Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Courthouse, Courtroom 1 – Fourth Floor, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, CA 94612. At the Settlement Fairness Hearing, the Federal Court will, among other things: (i) determine whether the proposed Settlement on the terms and conditions provided for in the Amended Stipulation is fair, reasonable, and adequate to Apple and its shareholders, and should be approved; (ii) determine whether the Judgment, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C to the Amended Stipulation, should be entered dismissing the Federal Action with prejudice; (iii) determine whether the agreed-to Fee and Expense Amount and Service Awards should be approved; and (iv) consider any other matters that may properly be brought before the Federal Court in connection with the Settlement.\n\nAny Current Apple Shareholder who or which continues to own shares of Apple common stock as of July 16, 2024, the date of the Settlement Fairness Hearing, has a right, but is not required to, appear and to be heard at the Settlement Fairness Hearing. Any Current Apple Shareholder who satisfies this requirement may enter an appearance through counsel of such shareholder’s own choosing and at such shareholder’s own expense, or may appear on their own.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Shattered Quarterly Records",
        "content": "Earnings season continues to roll along, with a solid chunk of companies already delivering their quarterly results. The period has remained positive, underpinned by strong results from the technology sector.\n\nAnd interestingly enough, several companies – Apple AAPL, Eaton ETN, and Spotify SPOT – posted quarterly records, with shares of each seeing buying pressure post-earnings. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nTechnology heavyweight Apple reported after the close yesterday, with the results bringing post-earnings fireworks. Concerning headline figures, the company posted a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and posted sales 1% ahead of expectations.\n\nImpressively, Services revenue of $23.9 billion reflected a quarterly record, showing 14% growth from the year-ago period. iPhone results weren’t as positive, with $45.9 billion in sales down 10% year-over-year.\n\nNonetheless, the titan wrapped up the quarterly results by announcing the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion. The print helped Apple shares see notable bullish activity post-earnings but overall remain underperforming relative to the S&P 500 YTD. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEaton\n\nEaton posted EPS of $2.40, growing 28% year over year and reflecting a quarterly record. Sales totaled $5.9 billion, reflecting another quarterly record and improving 8% from the year-ago period. Finally, segment margins reached 23.1%, another quarterly record and a 340-basis-point climb from the same period last year.\n\nThe company topped off the robust results with positive guidance, raising its outlook for organic growth, segment margins, and EPS. Shares have been considerably strong performers in 2024, gaining 34% and crushing the S&P 500.\n\nUnsurprisingly, analysts raised their earnings expectations across the board following the record-breaking quarter, with the stock holding its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify\n\nSpotify’s set of quarterly results came in well above expectations, beating our Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by a sizable 67% and posting revenue 2% ahead of expectations. The company’s growth has been stellar, with EPS growing 185% and sales 21% higher from the year-ago periods.\n\nThe company posted record profitability, aided by healthy subscriber gains and improved monetization. Monthly Active Users (MAUs) grew 19% year-over-year, whereas Premium Subscribers saw 14% growth from the year-ago period.\n\nSimilar to ETN, analysts have revised their earnings expectations considerably higher post-earnings, with Spotify holding the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season continues its rapid pace, with a plethora of companies scheduled to deliver results in the coming weeks. The Q1 cycle has turned out to be positive, underpinned by the technology sector’s strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period so far, several companies, including Apple AAPL, Eaton ETN, and Spotify SPOT, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "7 Apple Analysts Size Up Q2 Results: Artificial Intelligence 'A Major Upgrade Cycle Within Product Categories Such As The iPhone'\n\nTechnology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported second-quarter financial results that saw revenue and earnings per share beat Street estimates.\n\nAnalysts have responded to Apple’s results, updated guidance, increased dividend, and the announcement of a $110 billion buyback.\n\nThe Apple Analysts:\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan has a Buy rating and raises the price target from $225 to $230. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng has a Buy rating and $226 price target. Keybanc analyst Brandon Nispel has a Sector Weight rating and no price target. Needham analyst Laura Martin has a Buy rating and $220 price target. DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria has a Neutral rating and $200 price target. Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett has a Neutral rating and raises the price target from $189 to $196. Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar has a Neutral rating and $190 price target.\n\nRelated Link: Apple Delivered Much Better-Than-Feared ‘Jalen-Brunson-Like’ Quarter, Says Bullish Analyst: Why Betting Against Cupertino Is A ‘Wrong Move’\n\nBank of America on Apple: A multi-year upgrade cycle for Apple makes the stock a top pick for Mohan.\n\n\"Apple reported a strong quarter with many positives,\" Mohan said.\n\nThe analyst said third-quarter revenue guidance could be conservative with upside from Apple's Services and Accessories segments.\n\nMohan sees an iPhone upgrade cycle coming, driven by GenAI. The analyst also said Apple is growing iPhones in China and easing fears from investors.\n\nThe analyst highlights the AI opportunity for Apple.\n\n\"We expect Gen AI related features for iOS18 at WWDC in June and then at the iPhone event in Sep. We expect Apple to continue investment in its own Silicon and focus on integrating hardware, software and services to fully monetize the Gen AI opportunity.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs on Apple: Strength of Apple's Services and iPhone were keys in the second quarter for Ng.\n\n\"We gain confidence in our Buy rating with AAPL demonstrating the strength of its ecosystem and allaying several key concerns.\"\n\nThe analyst said Apple showed improving trends in Greater China, including iPhone growth.\n\n\"In our view, F2Q24 provides demonstrable momentum across AAPL's key categories and clears the way to a catalyst-rich NTM including increased clarity in AAPL's generative AI initiatives, new products and ongoing Services momentum.\"\n\nNg said Apple's installed base is \"underappreciated\" and the company's revenue per user could be improved in the future.\n\nKeyBanc on Apple: Artificial intelligence is a key item for Apple going forward, according to Nispel. The analyst is not convinced that consumers will rush out to buy new Apple AI devices like investors believe.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"While F3Q guidance was better than feared, we believe it's more driven by new product introductions in Mac/iPad, as we believe is implied by the guidance iPhone is down MSD,\" Nispel said.\n\nThe analyst expects soft upgrades for replacement cycles in the U.S. and increased competition in China to weigh on the iPhone going forward.\n\n\"AAPL's user base is growing across products and geographies; its user growth fuels growth in Services, creating an ecosystem that gives AAPL a competitive advantage, which should support AAPL's margin expansion and capital allocation.\"\n\nNeedham on Apple: Guidance, margins, share buybacks and China were keys in Apple's second quarter results for Martin.\n\n\"On China, AAPL stated that iPhone unit sales rose in mainland China vs channels checks of down 13% to 18%,\" Martin said.\n\nOne area of concern for Martin is Apple's commentary on generative AI.\n\n\"AAPL's GenAI commentary continues to be very weak (our view). Investors we talk to believe that GenAI is the next technology disruption, and AAPL continues to focus its commentary on the last disruption, which was mobile.\"\n\nMartin said Apple could be quiet about its GenAI ambitions, but capex spending guidance suggests it isn't increasing spending on the growth area.\n\nThe analyst said Apple was the biggest beneficiary of the consumer shift to mobile devices and could be slow in the \"3rd technological disruption cycle.\"\n\nDA Davidson on Apple: The second quarter was solid for Apple with a beat on revenue and earnings per share, Luria said.\n\nThe analyst is looking for more from Apple coming soon, turning attention to WWDC in June and more commentary on Apple's Generative AI efforts.\n\n\"We expect Apple to delivery meaningful announcements surrounding the implementation of generative AI across their ecosystem, which we believe can help catalyze a major upgrade cycle within product categories such as the iPhone,\" Luria said.\n\nLuria also highlighted Apple's Services segment in the new investor note.\n\n\"We continue to believe that this growing segment of revenue can help moderate growth for Apple moving forward, with a large user install base that includes over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on their platform.\"\n\nRosenblatt on Apple: Better-than-feared guidance from Apple was a highlight in the earnings report for Crockett.\n\nThe analyst said Apple's iPhone sales in China for the second quarter completely brushed off third party research estimates.\n\n\"In addition to growth in iPhone in China, Apple is bragging of setting sales record in major emerging markets globally, including India,\" Crockett said.\n\nCrockett said Apple stock is best when it trades based on disruptive innovation.\n\n\"The only real investable opportunity is gen AI, where Apple plans announcements for its WWDC in June and can leverage its skill with the hardware/software integration and proprietary neural chips and privacy.\"\n\nCrockett said Apple's risk is that its Gen AI efforts are not appealing enough.\n\nPiper Sandler on Apple: Headset concerns were the major item from Apple's second quarter, analyst Kumar is centering in on.\n\n\"The primary point of contention for Apple investors appears to be slowing handset growth in China, to which we point out that within China specifically the iPhone segment was down ~8%,\" Kumar said.\n\nThe analyst said Apple's quarter strength and reason for the stock being up is likely the Services segment, $110 billion buyback and better than expected results in China.\n\n\"Fundamentally we would like to see further improvements in iPhone trends before getting involved.\"\n\nAAPL Price Action: Apple shares are up 7% to $185.22 on Friday, versus a 52-week trading range of $164.08 to $199.62.\n\nRead Next: Despite Tim Cook’s Scant Details About iPhone AI, Tesla Investor Ross Gerber Thinks It Will Trigger ‘Whole New Upgrade Cycle’\n\nPhoto: Unsplash\n\nLatest Ratings for AAPL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Equal-Weight Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Strong Buy Jan 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article 7 Apple Analysts Size Up Q2 Results: Artificial Intelligence 'A Major Upgrade Cycle Within Product Categories Such As The iPhone' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The US economy added 175,000 jobs in April, which was far below analyst expectations - Scott Eells/Bloomberg\n\nTraders have pulled forward their expectations for the first interest rate cuts in the US as the economy added fewer jobs than expected.\n\nMoney markets indicate the US Federal Reserve will cut rates by September, compared to expectations of a change by November before the publication of the latest nonfarm payrolls data from the Labor Department.\n\nThe data showed that the world’s largest economy added 175,000 jobs last month, down from a revised March figure of 315,000, while the jobless rate edged slightly higher to 3.9pc.\n\nUS stock indexes on Wall Street jumped sharply higher and the FTSE 100 hit a new record high as the report also showed wages grew at a slower pace than expected at 3.9pc, compared to estimates of 4pc. It was down from 4.1pc in the year to March.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe US Federal Reserve opted on Wednesday to hold interest rates steady for a sixth meeting in a row at their 23-year highs of 5.25pc to 5.5pc.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell had warned that it is still too early to declare victory against stubborn inflation after “a lack of further progress” in a blow to hopes of imminent rate cuts.\n\nRichard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, said: “In recent months, it has become clear that the Fed is happy to move slowly in the cutting part of the rate cycle, but unwanted and unexpected weakness in the economy, as we are seeing today, may cause a shift in this approach.\n\n“A dive in the labour market may be what it takes to push the Fed from a stroll to a sprint.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:00 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThat’s it for the Markets blog this week.

Our retail editor Hannah Boland reports:\n\nHenrietta Billings, director of SAVE Britain’s Heritage, said the Housing Secretary would be “firmly justified” in once again refusing M&S’s request to demolish its flagship Oxford Street building.\n\nMr Gove rejected the plans last year and SAVE Britain’s Heritage said he would be justified in coming to the same conclusion to block the project a second time. The Housing Secretary has been forced to reconsider his decision after a successful legal challenge by M&S.\n\nMs Billings said: “M&S’s destructive plans were conceived more than six years ago and they’re looking increasingly outdated.\n\n“So much has changed since then, from our understanding of the sustainability impacts of demolition and re-building from scratch – to the widespread public interest in this case and growing awareness about the need for change.”\n\nRead the full story...

That period of exclusivity ends today, and a source familiar with the matter said the exclusivity period is unlikely to be extended, opening the doors to other bidders.\n\nSony and Apollo reportedly submitted a non-binding offer letter on Wednesday. The $26bn offer is a combination of cash and assumption of debt.\n\nParamount is behind major film and television brands such as Star Trek, Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones.\n\nhas been struggling to recover from last year’s months-long strikes by Hollywood writers and actors and a soft advertising market.\n\nIts streaming service also widely trails rivals such as Netflix and Disney+ in subscriber numbers.\n\nSony Pictures and Apollo have been approached for comment.

Now it will close by December, meaning it could still close as early as September, according to a company spokesman. US Steel's Mon Valley Works in Pennsylvania, pictured in February - Gene J.

Daniel Woolfson has the details:\n\nFears are growing over the risk of empty shelves as growers across Europe battle a combination of extreme weather, inflation and high interest rates.\n\nGiles Henschel, the owner of Olives et Al, a retailer of olives and olive oils, said: “The price of olive oil is unlikely to come down from where it is now. There will be shortages, there will not be enough.”\n\nMr Henschel has spent recent weeks on a motorcycle tour of olive growers across Europe, interviewing farmers and investigating the effects of climate change on the kitchen cupboard staple. He said: “I think we’re facing an existential threat to the business that we created.\n\n“Will we still be able to actually sell olives in three years time? I don’t know.

US Justice Department lawyers have said the huge sum is indicative of how important it is for Google to make itself the default search engine and block competitors from getting a foothold.\n\nGoogle says that customers could easily click away to other search engines if they wanted, but that they invariably prefer Google. Companies such as Apple testified at trial that they partner with Google because they consider its search engine to be superior.

        "title": "Is Apple Missing Out on the AI Hype?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence buzz across the tech world has increased over the past year. All the big players are competing with each other to grab a piece of this booming market. Nevertheless, one tech giant is seemingly on the limp in this race for dominance, or at least that's the image it wants to portray. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always stepped up the game by boosting innovation and enhancing the user experience. But with AI, the tech giant has been maintaining a discrete profile for a long time.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BTI.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that AI is here to revolutionize the tech landscape, a sort of renaissance if one thinks of it. PwC estimates AI will contribute a staggering $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Given these rosy projections, Apple's toned-down approach toward the technology has raised speculations about whether it is missing out on the AI hype or playing its cards in silence to take the market by surprise.\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nDespite recent financial struggles, including a major revenue slump since the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Apple saw a nearly 50% spike last year, though it lagged other tech giants such as Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company had a challenging start to 2024 with shares tumbling amid a series of analyst downgrades and was dethroned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world. Some critics have blamed Apple for not having a clear AI strategy unlike its competitors, such as Microsoft and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), which are aggressively investing in the technology.\n\nWhen it comes to AI (or machine learning, as Apple prefers to say), the company is not new to integrating such features into its devices. It has revolutionized many features using machine learning, including Siri, facial recognition and personalized recommendations. However, in the current landscape, compared to other tech giants, Apple has taken a more cautious approach to introducing and announcing AI features and investments. Apple is making calculated moves in the AI space behind the scenes. The company has acquired several AI start-ups in the past decade and is partnering with universities and research institutions to collaborate on projects.\n\nResearch and development spending is one of the key indicators to measure a company's commitment to introducing new features and advancements into its business strategy, especially for tech companies. Apple's R&D spending was roughly 7% of its revenue for 2022. In comparison, in the same year, Google and Microsoft allocated nearly double for R&D and Meta's (NASDAQ:META) spending was more than four times Apple's. According to the 2023 Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard by the European Commission, Apple ranks in fourth place, above Asian rivals Huawei (fifth) and Samsung (XKRX:005930) (seventh). However, the company ranks below Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft (first three places). While this spending disparity could be highlighting a difference in priorities, it is easy to overlook Apple's strategy of acquiring resources in other areas to step up innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle-Apple alliance: A double-edged sword\n\nRecent reports suggest Apple could enter an AI partnership with Alphabet's Google. As per Bloomberg, Apple is negotiating with the Google parent company to license its state-of-the-art AI model, Gemini. If the deal goes through, Apple might integrate Gemini's AI features into its upcoming operating systems for devices. The possibility of this partnership raises many questions about the company's long-standing tradition of prioritizing in-house development and tight control over its technology.\n\nGoogle and Apple have been in a strategic partnership for a long while and it has proven to be a profitable one. Currently, Google is the default search engine for Apple's Safari browser, and to secure this position Google is reportedly paying around $18 billion annually to Apple. Therefore, Google's AI model Gemini seems like a natural choice for Apple. However, other than the obvious contradiction of the iPhone maker's privacy-first policy, this deal might raise many other concerns, including legal challenges and reduced quality in the user experience.\n\nCurrently, tech giants are facing scrutiny around the world, especially from the U.S. government and European Union. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for its alleged monopoly on the smartphone market and unfair treatment of developers through its App Store system. Partnering with another major tech firm and a rival might fuel the current controversy and could attract more legal scrutiny. Moreover, if Apple begins to rely on Google for AI tools, it could stifle competition and reduce consumer choices in the future for potential AI feature upgrades. Google's AI is a cloud-based system that allows developers to use consumer data to strengthen the LLM to become more efficient, which means the privacy of the user data will not be assured. This means more red flags for Apple.\n\nThe current regulatory scrutiny is already hampering Apple's operations. The potential delay in winning the lawsuit and the restrictions that may be imposed by the government could hinder the company's efforts in the AI field. Additionally, the financial burden of a lawsuit could put a halt on the company's ability to find an internal AI solution. Moreover, a well-defined and transparent data protection framework should be put into practice before entering into a partnership with Google, if at all.\n\nApple's AI master plan\n\nEven though Apple is not vocal about its advancements with AI efforts, several ongoing projects are making progress. News surrounding the company's own AI model has garnered substantial traction. According to sources, Apple has reportedly developed a large language model called Ajax GPT, with a performing capacity exceeding GPT 3.5. Also, it may be working on an AI-powered chatbot dubbed Apple GPT.\n\nApple might have been suspiciously quiet about AI in product launches. However, it has acquired the greatest number of startups among all tech giants since 2017. The company is likely to have spent around $1 billion in acquiring various AI ventures. In 2023 alone, Apple reportedly bought more than 30 AI ventures. These acquisitions take place mostly to cover various specialties such as self-driving technology, voice design, music generation and image recognition, but sometimes to even acquire the talented individuals behind these startups.\n\nThe latest and most important addition to Apple's AI arsenal is DarwinAI. Acquiring DarwinAI can be seen as an investment in technology as well as personnel, particularly specialists in machine learning and AI from the University of Waterloo. A prominent figure in the AI community and former director at the University of Waterloo, Alexander Wang, is currently appointed as a director at Apple, leading the company's AI efforts in Canada. Also, DarwinAI's synthesis model is expected to help Apple's most ambitious AI capability; on-device AI (also referred to as Edge AI) with plans to move forward with generative AI programs in the future.\n\nTwo recent theses published by Apple have shown the company's effectiveness in incorporating advanced levels of AI within the pre-existing ecosystem. One research paper in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne delves into the development of the MM1 generative AI model. The results of the thesis demonstrate Apple's capabilities in developing cutting-edge AI architectures, particularly multimodal learning, which combines images with text data.\n\nAnother paper published showcases the successful execution of large language models in natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks with limited memory. The methods used in the thesis collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a four to 25 times increase in inference speed compared to other approaches in CPU and GPU. Ultimately, this research paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory to deliver exceptionally faster performance.\n\nBoth these research papers and recent acquisitions indicate Apple is on the right track to offering on-device AI capabilities that will far exceed what is currently available in the market.\n\nUsability focus is Apple's product strategy\n\nVoice Assistant, Facial Recognition, Photo optimization, Personalized recommendations, Animoji and Fitness tracking may look like functions that have nothing to do with AI, but all these features are fundamentally built upon various machine learning technologies. Apple was the pioneering tech brand that managed to integrate these features seamlessly into mobile devices successfully. Today, it is working behind the scenes to improve these features by integrating AI.\n\nWhen Siri, the voice assistant, was released, it was received remarkably well across the globe. But soon after the initial product launch, because of Siri's inability to complete slightly advanced tasks, its credibility declined. Following many internal conflicts faced by Apple's Siri team with engineers frustrated by a lack of tools and data to improve it, the chat bot has started lagging behind its competitors. Meanwhile, Google Assistant, with its superior natural language processing and ability to handle complex queries, and Amazon Alexa, with its vast compatible ecosystem, are gaining momentum.\n\nWith the new on-device AI integration, Apple may have reversed the future of Siri and also could enhance the performance of Apple fitness trackers. The Apple Watch already integrates AI features to enhance fitness tracking. For example, the watch uses machine learning to identify workout types and analyze heart rate data, helping to offer more personalized coaching assistance. However, some competitors offer more advanced AI-powered health monitoring features, including blood pressure monitoring.\n\nKeeping up with its brand of prioritizing the user experience more than anything else, Apple has made its first direct AI-related product with the new MacBook Air with an M3 chip highlighting its capabilities for AI tasks. This can be seen as a major breakthrough in Apple's AI strategy, promising its customers not a cloud-based AI service, but an on-device AI experience that upholds user privacy.\n\nApple follows a pattern of announcing new features as they are coming to the market. Therefore, the upcoming Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June may bring potential AI-related announcements. Speculations suggest AI features will be integrated into the new Mac OS as well as iOS 18. The speculations are further strengthened with Apple acknowledging the term AI in its latest quarterly earnings transcript, deviating from its usual terminology. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook has confirmed the introduction of generative AI software in Apple products later in the year.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction of AI-integrated hardware such as Edge AI is expected to have a positive impact on the iPhone upgrade cycle. With the current upcycle period standing at a record high of 4.5 years, users upgrading their mobiles for a better AI-powered user experience will boost new hardware sales. This is crucial for Apple amid four straight quarters of sales declines and the dampening sales numbers in China. Analysts such as Dan Ives and Ben Reitzes believe that with AI integration, Apple will experience another supercycle in smartphone upgrades.\n\nApple's AI gamble - Missing out or playing the long game?\n\nApple may not be as aggressively discussing its AI plans compared to other tech giants, but the company is making steady progress behind the scenes. The company's on-device AI integration strategy may prove to be the differentiator in the future. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 26, the stock is valued at a premium to the five-year average of 24. This premium may seem unjustifiable at first, but if the company's on-device AI strategy succeeds, a potential iPhone upgrade supercycle will help it book stellar revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. Apple is certainly not missing out on AI despite not joining the hype publicly, yet. Contrarian investors may want to build a position in Apple to potentially benefit from a surprise AI announcement in the coming months.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Vanguard ETFs to Buy If You're Looking for Reliable Passive Income",
        "content": "Vanguard exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are excellent ways to get low-cost exposure to a variety of stocks. And while investors may be familiar with one of the more well-known Vanguard funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, Vanguard Growth ETF, or the Vanguard Value ETF, there may be even better funds out there for generating reliable passive income\n\nWith expense ratios of 0.10% or less, here's why the Vanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU) are all great choices for generating dividend income. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Vanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF\n\nWhen investors think of high-yield dividend stocks, companies with 4%, 5%, or maybe even 6% dividend yields may come to mind. And while there are plenty of stocks out there with those kinds of yields, the Vanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF balances quality with yield by focusing on companies where dividends are a core part of the capital return program. The emphasis on quality is one of the reasons why the fund yields 2.8% -- which may be less than what you may expect from a high-yield fund.\n\nProcter & Gamble(NYSE: PG), which is the fund's fifth-largest holding, is a great example of the caliber of company you'll find in this ETF. P&G yields 2.5%, which is decent but not great. But the company is as reliable as it gets, with 68 consecutive years of dividend raises and a massive capital return program that features buybacks and dividends.\n\nExxonMobil and Chevron are also top 10 holdings in the ETF. So are big banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Despite having a mere 1.4% yield, Walmart is the 11th largest holding, and is a good example of why yield isn't everything. Walmart is a Dividend King with over 50 consecutive years of dividend raises. Its low 1.4% yield is mainly a result of the stock's strong performance and not a lack of commitment to the dividend.\n\nVanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF gives investors a yield that is more than double the yield of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, while still focusing on quality.\n\n2. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is basically a more extreme example of the Vanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF. It focuses even more on quality than yield by including growth stocks you wouldn't find in the High-Dividend Yield ETF.\n\nNotable examples are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), the two largest holdings in the Dividend Appreciation ETF -- making up a combined 7.7% weighting. Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard(NYSE: MA) are also top 10 holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fund focuses on companies with track records of dividend increases, where yield is an afterthought. Growth stocks drag the fund's yield down to just 1.8%, but again, the focus is more on companies that are committed to raising their dividends. In this vein, the fund doesn't punish a company with a low yield due to an outperforming stock price.\n\nFor example, Microsoft, Apple, Visa, and Mastercard have all put up solid returns over the last five years, but they have also rapidly increased their dividends in a relatively short amount of time (except Apple, which spends way more on buybacks than dividends). By comparison, low-growth companies that focus on dividends and buybacks rather than reinvest in their businesses often underperform the market. MSFT Chart\n\nEven though all four stocks yield between 0.5% and 0.7%, they are still top holdings in the fund because they are committed to their dividends. In fact, Microsoft and Apple pay more dividends than any other U.S.-based company, but they are so massive that it would take a lot to pay a compelling yield. With a market capitalization of just over $3 trillion, Microsoft would have to pay over $90 billion per year in dividends just to have a 3% yield -- roughly the value of companies like Palo Alto Networks, CVS Health, or Dell Technologies.\n\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is my personal favorite ETF on this list because it focuses on the most important quality of a dividend-paying company -- growing the payout over time. There are plenty of companies with high yields because their stock prices have underperformed the market. But a high yield means little if the capital losses outweigh the payout or the dividend is unsustainable and the company cuts it.\n\n3. Vanguard Utilities ETF\n\nUtility companies are excellent passive income investments because they tend to generate consistent cash flows no matter what the economy is doing. The Vanguard Utilities ETF has a yield of 3.3%, making this ETF a good choice for investors who want to generate a sizable amount of passive income or supplement income in retirement.\n\nThe Vanguard Utilities ETF is a straightforward product that mirrors the performance of the utility sector. The fund is a good fit for value investors as well, since it sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.5 -- which is lower than the 24.9 for the Dividend Appreciation ETF and 25.3 for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.\n\nBut despite being more on the value side of the market, utility stocks can still be more expensive than sectors like energy, materials, and many industrial and financial stocks. Therefore, it may surprise you that the Vanguard High-Yield ETF has an even lower 16.1 P/E ratio. Still, utility stocks are a great choice if you're looking for passive income and a sector that has historically been defensive in nature and \"safe\" during recessions.\n\nPower your passive income with an ETF that's right for you\n\nThe Vanguard High-Dividend Yield ETF, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, and the Vanguard Utilities ETF showcase the different ways you can invest in dividend stocks. The best pick for you will depend on your risk tolerance and the growth/value balance you may be looking for.\n\nEspecially for risk-tolerant investors with long time horizons, the key is not to get too caught up in what a stock yields today and focus more on finding a company with a strong investment thesis and runway for growing earnings and dividends for years, if not decades, to come. That's why the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is my favorite choice on this list, but the other two funds are also solid picks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Whitehall Funds - Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Whitehall Funds - Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Whitehall Funds - Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "If you've ever wondering why more than 40,000 people flock to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting each year, look no further than the track record of longtime CEO Warren Buffett.\n\nSince the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" became CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a greater-than 4,900,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A). Returns like these are bound to get money managers noticed on Wall Street.\n\nAlthough extensive books have been written discussing the \"recipe\" Buffett has used to grow his wealth and that of Berkshire's long-term shareholders, the one factor that's arguably played the biggest role in his investment success is portfolio concentration. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAs of the closing bell on April 26, 2024, Berkshire's $372 billion portfolio was spread across 45 stocks and two index funds. However, a small number of these holdings make up the lion's share of invested assets. Buffett and his top investment aides, which until his recent passing including the great Charlie Munger, have long believed that their best ideas deserve added weighting.\n\nThe following two magnificent companies currently comprise 52% of the $372 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nApple: $153.3 billion in market value (41.2% of invested assets)\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that the largest holding (by a mile!) in Warren Buffett's portfolio, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), is the company he referred to as \"a better business than any we own\" during Berkshire Hathaway's 2023 annual shareholder meeting. Apple accounts for more than 41% of invested assets.\n\nWarren Buffett's love for Apple as an investment and business boils down to four factors: branding, innovation, management, and capital returns.\n\nWith regard to the former, Apple has some of the most loyal customers on the planet, and is recognized as one of the most-valuable global brands. This loyalty goes a long way to generating predictable sales and cash flow year after year.\n\nSecondly, Apple is an innovator on multiple fronts. Most people are rightly familiar with its success as an inventor/producer of physical products that include the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch. Since introducing a 5G-capable version of the iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has controlled at least half of domestic smartphone market share.\n\nBut Apple is also innovating beyond its physical products. The company is undergoing a multiyear transition that's emphasizing subscription services. A services-driven model should lift its operating margin, generate predictable cash flow in any economic climate, and smooth out the sales fluctuations that have historically accompanied major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe third reason Warren Buffett has no intention of parting ways with his company's massive stake in Apple is the company's top-tier management team. CEO Tim Cook is trusted by consumers and Wall Street, and is the brains behind Apple's services transformation.\n\nLastly, Apple's capital-return program is unrivaled among publicly traded companies. Aside from dishing out $14.8 billion in dividend income annually to its shareholders, its board has green-lit the repurchase of $651 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Put another way, Apple has spent more on buybacks over the last 10 years and change than the market caps of all but eight S&P 500 companies, one of which is itself.\n\nShare buybacks offer a dual benefit in Buffett's eyes. Reducing Apple's outstanding share count with steady or growing net income results in higher earnings per share (EPS) and a more attractive valuation. Additionally, share repurchases are increasing Berkshire's ownership stake in Apple without Buffett or his aides having to lift a finger. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBank of America: $39.1 billion in market value (10.5% of invested assets)\n\nThe other magnificent stock that, along with Apple, makes up 52% of the $372 billion portfolio Warren Buffett manages at Berkshire Hathaway is money-center goliath Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), which is commonly referred to as \"BofA.\"\n\nThere's not a sector the Oracle of Omaha loves putting his company's capital to work in more than financials. The reason for this is simple: they're cyclical.\n\nRecessions are both a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle. But Berkshire's greatest investment minds astutely realize that downturns in the economy don't last long. Only three recessions since 1945 have lasted at least 12 months, and none have surpassed 18 months in length.\n\nOn the other hand, most periods of expansion have stuck around for multiple years, including two growth spurts that endured for longer than a decade. Bank stocks are able to take advantage of these long-winded expansions by growing their loan portfolios.\n\nPerhaps no money-center bank is better positioned in the current economic climate than Bank of America. Among America's largest banks by assets, it's the most sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Federal Reserve undertaking its most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s has translated into BofA generating billions of dollars in added interest income each quarter. If inflation remains stubbornly high and the Fed is forced to delay its rate-easing cycle, Bank of America should disproportionately benefit.\n\nBank of America's ongoing investments in technology are paying off, as well. It's successfully shifted 76% of its consumer households to digital banking and completed 50% of all consumer loan sales online or via mobile app during the March-ended quarter. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions. As digital banking adoption grows, so should BofA's operating efficiency.\n\nBank stocks are also known for their hearty capital-return programs. When the U.S. economy is expanding, it's not uncommon for Bank of America's board to return in excess of $20 billion, annually, to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.\n\nWarren Buffett simply has no incentive to sell Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Bank of America anytime soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple’s Surprise iPhone China Growth Leaves Lingering Questions",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. surprised investors with a decent beat on quarterly revenue from China, countering months of data that showed a quickening decline in iPhone sales.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Turkey Confirms All Trade Halt With Israel Over War in Gaza Huawei Secretly Backs US Research, Awarding Millions in Prizes Biden Calls Ally Japan ‘Xenophobic’ Along With China, Russia In Jamie Dimon's America, the Stock Market Has Already Voted\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook said iPhone revenue in mainland China grew “on a reported basis,” before adjustments related to Covid supply chain disruptions in 2022. He reiterated Apple’s long-term optimism about a market that’s shrinking but still accounted for 18% of the company’s net sales.\n\nInvestors scrutinize the company’s performance in China because of its role as both a huge market and global iPhone production base. Cook kept his remarks on the subject brief, leaving analysts to square those with independent data showing the iPhone is rapidly losing ground in the country’s mobile arena. On the call, he fielded questions on China from at least three analysts seeking clarification.\n\n“What are we missing,” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers asked, “given the data points that were reported throughout the course of the last quarter?”\n\nGovernment data of new device registrations showed the iPhone down heavily in the first two months of the year, while analysts at Counterpoint Research saw a 19% decline in March-quarter sales in China. IDC, generally considered the benchmark for tracking the mobile industry, estimated global iPhone shipments slid 10% in the period. The discrepancy may arise from differences in the way analysts and Apple account for revenue.\n\n“We tracked a year-on-year decline in total value generated by iPhones in China in 1Q24,” IDC analyst Will Wong said after Apple’s results. “The average selling price played a key part in explaining why there’s a difference. IDC counted the street prices (i.e. the prices that consumers paid), while Apple is likely using another price level, such as factory price, in its financial report.”\n\nApple’s shares gained as much as 7.9% in extended trading Thursday, after it announced a $110 billion buyback and a smaller-than-expected decline in global sales. Suppliers in Asia, from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to LG Innotek Co., surged on Friday after the report.\n\nApple doesn’t dive deep into geographical data nor reveal iPhone shipments in general, leaving third-party analysts to parse available information. This year’s iPhone sales in China were more heavily skewed toward newer models, Counterpoint analyst Charles Moon said, nudging up the average selling price per unit. That may help explain how the company’s unit sales could be down while revenue was up.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Mostly it’s the shift in product mix that’s supporting the revenue number,” Moon said. Counterpoint estimates Apple’s global ASP for the March quarter was $900, a new high for the period. “New models accounted for around 80% share in Q1 2024 versus only two-thirds in Q1 2023, pushing ASPs higher.”\n\nThe resurgence of Huawei Technologies Co. has transformed China’s smartphone market since the summer. The Shenzhen-based firm, Apple’s strongest rival in the premium segment, reported a six-fold profit surge during the March quarter and was top of Canalys’ rankings for shipments in the country. Like the other researchers, Canalys found iPhone shipments in China down significantly.\n\nOn Thursday’s call, Cook urged analysts to take the longer view and “step back from the 90-day cycle.”\n\n“What I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class” in China, he said. “We clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world.”\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. shares jumped in late trading after the company posted stronger-than-expected sales last quarter and predicted a return to growth in the current period, sparking optimism that a slowdown is easing.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudi Arabia Steps Up Arrests Of Those Attacking Israel Online Huawei Secretly Backs US Research, Awarding Millions in Prizes Biden Calls Ally Japan ‘Xenophobic’ Along With China, Russia US and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East Turkey Halts All Trade With Israel Over War in Gaza\n\nRevenue fell 4.3% to $90.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, which ended March 30, the company said in a statement Thursday. That compared with an average analyst estimate of $90.3 billion. Profit in the quarter also topped Wall Street projections, and the company announced the biggest stock buyback in history.\n\nIn the current period, Apple expects revenue to climb by a percentage in the low single digits, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang.\n\nThe results came as a relief to investors, who have been waiting for the iPhone maker to pull out of a long slump. Apple has posted sales declines in five of the past six quarters, hurt by a sluggish smartphone market and headwinds in China. The company warned analysts in February that revenue in the latest period would be down about 5% from a year earlier.\n\nThe shares gained as much as 7.9% in extended trading after the report was released. Apple had been down 10% to $173.03 this year through Thursday’s close.\n\nEarnings amounted to $1.53 a share in the second quarter, exceeding the $1.50 analysts had estimated. Apple increased its dividend 4% to 25 cents a share, in line with expectations. And the board approved plans to buy back an additional $110 billion of the company’s stock.\n\nA lack of innovative new devices has contributed to slow sales at Apple, but the company looks to begin rectifying that on May 7. That’s when it plans to unveil new iPads — the first updates to its tablet line in 1 1/2 years.\n\nRead More: Apple to Hold Launch Event on May 7, With New iPads Expected\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also is planning a long-awaited push into generative artificial intelligence. In June, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is expected to lay out Apple’s AI strategy at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\n“We are making significant investments in the space,” Apple’s Maestri said Thursday. “We believe we are well-positioned.”\n\nApple’s slowdown in China has been of particular concern to investors in recent months. Consumers there are flocking to homegrown smartphone brands, and the government has banned the use of foreign technology in some offices.\n\nStory continues\n\nCounterpoint Research estimated that sales of the iPhone nosedived 19% in China during the first three months of the year, the product’s worst quarter since 2020. Worldwide, shipments of the device fell nearly 10% in the quarter, according to IDC, marking the steepest drop since Covid lockdowns snarled supply chains in 2022.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Apple’s China results were more upbeat than expected. The company generated $16.4 billion in revenue from greater China last quarter. Though that number was down from a year earlier, it handily beat the $15.9 billion analysts had predicted.\n\nRead More: Apple’s China iPhone Sales Dive 19% in Worst Quarter Since 2020\n\nMaestri said that the China concerns were overblown. “We were happy with our results in China,” he said. “The reality is different from maybe what you read at times.”\n\nIn mainland China, revenue from the iPhone actually grew last quarter, the company said.\n\nAt the same time, Apple hasn’t shown that new product categories can reinvigorate growth. It canceled work on a self-driving car in February, eliminating a project that some had hoped could become one of its famous “next big things.”\n\nThe company did push into the mixed-reality headset market this year, with the Feb. 2 debut of the Vision Pro. But that product is off to a slow start and could take years before it adds meaningfully to Apple’s revenue.\n\nThe company’s biggest moneymaker remains the iPhone, which accounts for about half of sales. The product generated $46 billion in the second quarter, topping estimates of $45.8 billion. That was a sharp decline from the $51.3 billion Apple reported in the year-ago quarter — despite the fact that the latest model was considered to be a substantial upgrade.\n\nApple is planning to upgrade the iPhone this year with slightly bigger screens and new chips focused on AI. The Pro models also will add a new button for capturing photo and video, but they’ll otherwise look the same as current versions.\n\nThe iPad business continued its decline last quarter, with revenue coming in at $5.56 billion. That missed the average analyst estimate of $5.91 billion. For the first time in the product’s history, Apple went an entire calendar year without upgrading the iPad’s hardware. The device may fare better in the current quarter, with pent-up demand helping fuel sales of the models set to be unveiled next week.\n\nThe Mac generated $7.45 billion in sales, beating the $6.79 billion projection. The business got a boost from the new MacBook Air, which was updated in March with an M3 chip. Apple is planning to release its first Macs with M4 processors later this year, adding a fresh focus on AI capabilities, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nRead More: Apple to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips\n\nApple’s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment brought in $7.91 billion revenue. That compares with estimates of $8.29 billion and represents a nearly 10% decline from the year-ago quarter. The latest Apple Watch models were only minor upgrades, and the company hasn’t resolved litigation surrounding a disabled feature for calculating blood-oxygen saturation.\n\nServices were a relative bright spot, growing 14% to $23.9 billion in revenue. That topped Wall Street expectations of $23.3 billion. The category includes Apple Music, the TV+ streaming platform and iCloud subscriptions, but its revenue primarily comes from the App Store.\n\nThat business is under pressure from regulators, with Apple being forced to allow third-party marketplaces and payment services in the European Union. Depending on how Apple fares in a legal battle with the Justice Department, it may have to make changes in the US as well.\n\n(Updates shares in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

In 2018, the tech giant authorized $100 billion in share repurchases, according to data compiled by market research firm Birinyi Associates that goes back to 1999.\n\n“An astonishing number,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. “Apple may be acknowledging that they are becoming a value stock that returns money to shareholders rather than a high powered growth stock that needs its cash for R&D or expansion.”\n\nAll told, Apple is responsible for the top six of the 10 largest share-repurchase announcements ever made in the US. The list also includes Chevron Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nApple also reported quarterly results post-market Thursday that exceeded investor expectations. The company posted sales that were better than estimates and predicted that it would return to revenue growth in the current period. Apple also raised its quarterly dividend for the twelfth year in a row. That stoked hopes that the slowdown that’s hit the company is easing.\n\nRead: Apple Rallies After Company Forecasts Return to Sales Growth (2)\n\nShares rose as much as 7.9% in post-market trading.

        "content": "Thursday, May 2nd, 2024\r\n\r\nMarket indices put up healthy numbers this Thursday. Following well-behaved Jobless Claims figures (but surprisingly worse Productivity/Unit Labor Costs), off a mostly down day Wednesday and a tough ride since Monday’s high, markets forged higher: the Dow gained +322 points, +0.85%, the S&P 500 was +0.91%, the Nasdaq up an impressive +235 points, +1.51%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 +1.57%. Only the Russell is in the green over the past five sessions.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL posted mild outperformance in its fiscal Q2 report this afternoon. Earnings of $1.53 per share beat expectations by 2 cents, on revenues of $90.75 billion which nudged higher than the $89.99 billion analysts were looking for. iPhone sales were slightly down from estimates, and more than -10% lower year over year. But the company has put forth the largest share buyback in history: $110 billion, while Apple’s dividend yield has been raised to 25 cents per share. AAPL is now trading +3.5% in the late session. I guess it’s official: Apple is now an old-school equity.\r\n\r\nBlock SQ posted big beats on its top and bottom lines after today’s close. Earnings of 85 cents per share easily surpassed the 62 cents in the Zacks consensus (and more than double the 40 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter), on revenues of $5.96 billion, well ahead of the $5.75 billion expected. The point-of-sale register supplier saw its cash app gross profit blossom +25% year over year to $6.98 billion. Shares are zooming ahead +10% in late trading.\r\n\r\nCoinbase COIN also scoffed at top and bottom-line estimates in its Q1 report this afternoon. Earnings more than quadrupled to $4.40 per share from $1.04 anticipated, on $1.64 billion swept beyond the $1.26 billion expected. EBITDA margins rose +62% year over year on strong trading rates and higher crypto prices. The crypto trading platform counted 312 billion in Q1 trading volume. But shares gained +9% ahead of the release, and have sold off -3% on the news.\r\n\r\nBoth Booking.com BKNG and Expedia EXPE put up strong Q1s, as “outbound travel” continues to find buyers. Booking’s earnings reached $20.39 per share, way ahead of the $14.03 expected, while revenues of $4.42 billion trounced the $4.25 billion analysts were looking for. Expedia swung to positive earnings to 21 cents per share (versus -37 cents projected) on $2.89 billion in revenues beating the $2.80 billion in the Zacks consensus. But Booking is +5% in late trading while Expedia is -7% — strength in travel to Asia helped the Priceline and Kayak parent, while Expedia lowered expectations for its VRBO unit in the coming quarter.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is the Employment Situation report from the U.S. government. Last month reportedly topped 300K new jobs filled for only the second time in the past year, and well ahead of where labor force projections were in the early part of this year. Expectations are for 240K jobs in April, down a tad but still 100K or so more than we need to account for retiring Baby Boomers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, we’re still seeing excellent employment numbers, and that goes for Wednesday’s private-sector payroll numbers from ADP ADP as well. But a big negative surprise in the labor market might be enough to start shaking the Fed loose to make a move on interest rate cuts sooner than later.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

But, so far, the technology doesn't appear to be driving sales of competing smartphones from the likes of Samsung and Google.\n\nCook has been relatively tightlipped regarding Apple's generative AI plans, dropping small tidbits about the company's investments here and there. This is one of the first times he's come out so strongly about how Apple will set itself apart from its Big Tech rivals in the generative AI space.\n\nWall Street is waiting on tenterhooks for Apple's generative AI announcements. The company hasn't debuted any generative AI products since the technology exploded in popularity in late-2022.\n\nRivals including Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have rolled out a series of generative AI capabilities and products including chatbots and search engine improvements. Microsoft, in particular, has added generative AI directly to Windows 11 via the Windows 11 Copilot.\n\nIf Apple's generative AI plans are going to live up to Wall Street's expectations, it will need to enable some kind of must-have features that users can't get on their existing devices. We'll find out what Apple's cooking up next month. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.53 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.52 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.32%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of 4.31%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, posted revenues of $90.75 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.85%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $94.84 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 12.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.31 on $82.33 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.53 on $382.77 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Mini computers is currently in the bottom 11% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Quantum-Si Incorporated (QSI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 9.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -35.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nQuantum-Si Incorporated's revenues are expected to be $0.45 million, up 80% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Paramount has spent a decade as the source of buyout rumors. That might finally come to an end.",
        "content": "Paramount Global (PARA) has been at the center of media merger talks for years. Now, the company's fate could soon be determined with a key negotiation window set to expire on Friday.\n\nNational Amusements, the holding company run by Shari Redstone, is in exclusive talks with David Ellison's Skydance Media to sell its controlling stake in the media giant, according to a source familiar with the matter. Skydance has previously collaborated with Paramount on the production of popular film franchises, including \"Mission Impossible,\" \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" and \"Transformers,\" among others.\n\nParamount's exclusivity window with Skydance expires on Friday, although it's possible that deadline could be extended. Paramount's nonvoting shareholders have publicly expressed concerns over the terms of a Skydance deal, which they say unfairly benefits Redstone at the expense of other investors.\n\nSkydance isn't Paramount's only suitor either. Sony Pictures Entertainment and private equity firm Apollo Global Management have formally expressed interest in purchasing the media giant for $26 billion, according to a source familiar with the situation. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo.)\n\nParamount's fate ultimately comes down to what Shari, the daughter of the late media mogul Sumner Redstone, decides.\n\n\"We don’t expect Paramount, as currently constituted, to operate independently for much longer,\" Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin wrote in a note to clients on April 30.\n\nAmid the turmoil over its future, Paramount recently announced the departure of its CEO Bob Bakish, who was reportedly at odds with Redstone over a Skydance deal.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Ariel Investments co-CEO John Rogers told Yahoo Finance. \"It's just really crazy to have the CEO fired in the midst of earnings season, in the midst of an M&A transaction, in the midst of a crucial negotiation with Charter Communications.\"\n\nDolgin added Bakish's ousting signals \"the company is simply biding time until it either merges with Skydance or accepts a superior takeout offer.\" Shari Redstone arrives at the red carpet of the 44th Kennedy Center Honors at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Dec. 5, 2021. (Tom Brenner/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nParamount's M&A rumor mill\n\nParamount has long been viewed as a potential acquisition target due to its small size relative to competitors. The company boasts a current market cap of just about $10 billion, compared to Disney's (DIS) $200 billion and Netflix's (NFLX) roughly $240 billion.\n\nRumors of a sale have circulated the company for years following highly publicized corporate governance issues dating back about a decade ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2015, Sumner Redstone — the billionaire media magnate whose vast empire included Viacom and CBS as well as National Amusements — became the subject of shareholder outcry amid his deteriorating health.\n\nRedstone's mental capacity was frequently questioned and even led to a civil lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. One year later, the fight for control of the company reached a fever pitch.\n\nSumner Redstone stepped down from his position as chairman of CBS and Viacom in February 2016, prompting a nasty legal battle between former Viacom chairman Philippe Dauman and Shari Redstone on who would ultimately control the Viacom-CBS empire.\n\nShari Redstone eventually won that fight, with the family holding on to its controlling stake. However, the legal drama prompted a severe leadership shake-up across the board with Bob Bakish eventually placed at the helm of Viacom in December 2016. Sumner stepped down from his board position a few days later.\n\nThe public turmoil led to increased chatter surrounding a potential sale throughout the late 2010s, both prior to and after the eventual merger of Viacom and CBS Corp. in 2019.\n\nOver the years, telecom giants including AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) reportedly expressed interest in purchasing CBS, while tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Netflix eyed acquiring a major studio like Paramount Pictures to beef up their respective streaming services.\n\nThe most recent flurry of M&A reports surrounding Paramount kicked off with Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav meeting with Bakish at the end of 2023 to discuss a potential merger, as first reported by Axios.\n\nThat opened the M&A floodgates with media mogul Byron Allen offering a reported $30 billion to buy all of Paramount's outstanding shares, including debt, at the start of the year.\n\nThe company also weighed selling parts of its business. BET and Showtime were two assets that had been the subject of consistent sale rumors in recent years. Paramount ultimately decided against selling the company in parts, largely due to Redstone's preference to keep the company together.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 5G Technology Stocks With the Potential to Make You an Overnight Millionaire",
        "content": "5G stocks have an increasingly bad rap, as initial trends (reminiscent of blockchain enthusiasm, then artificial intelligence exuberance) pointed to every 5G company as a millionaire-maker. But, just as we saw with blockchain and are starting to see with AI, only a handful of companies are truly innovative and worth buying for the long-term: the rest are riding the tailcoats of others’ initiatives. But, now that the dust has settled over the wider industry, those top 5G stocks are coming to the surface — at a discount.\n\nRapid advancements drive the surge in innovation within 5G stocks. We use more data than ever, necessitating expanded coverage from terrestrial and space-based telecom providers. Additionally, the rise of edge computing is increasing the demand for ultra-fast data connections, and semiconductor innovations are enhancing our connectivity as the Internet of Things concept continues to evolve.\n\nDespite the market often pricing them as volatile meme stocks, quality 5G stocks are far from speculative. And these 5G stocks are as high-quality as they come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) hits two major “hard tech” investment criteria: the semiconductor company is also a strong 5G and wireless data stock in its own right. This company supplies critical semiconductors across the wireless ecosystem, from cell towers to user phones, with a key role in expanding 5G connectivity globally through its components vital for band switching and other 5G functionalities.\n\nWhile Skyworks benefits from a vast market potential, its heavy reliance on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which constituted more than 65% of its 2023 revenue, introduces risk. Still, the fast-growing and expanding 5G market, projected to grow at 32% annually until 2030, provides a buffer against client concentration risks.\n\nInstitutional investors hold 84% of Skyworks’ shares, underscoring the stock’s smart money backing. Beyond basic passive indexing institutions (Vanguard et al.), Skyworks’ roster includes brand-name hedge and active fund managers. This broad institutional support indicates a strong belief in the unique value of this 5G-meets-semiconductor stock within the niche tech sector.\n\nFabrinet (FN) A concept image of a cellphone tower with numbers surrounding it.\n\nLike Skyworks, Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) stands out among 5G stocks by sitting at the intersection of multiple emerging tech trends, including artificial intelligence. Fabrinet specializes in manufacturing optical cables essential for high-speed data transmission across various hardware platforms, capable of speeds exceeding 800GB per second. These cables are hot topics for 5G data transfer, advancing machine learning and AI technologies. This particular product line contributes $500 million to Fabrinet’s revenue, highlighting its importance to the company’s financial health.\n\nStory continues\n\nFabrinet is a crucial supplier to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the semiconductor giant, alongside many other big-name 5G and semiconductor companies. While pure-play 5G competitors vie for leadership in the sector, Fabrinet secures its profitability by providing essential components required in the industry, ensuring its success irrespective of which company leads the market.\n\nWith a valuation of just 2.9x sales and 25x earnings, Fabrinet seems undervalued, considering its pivotal role across multiple domains. As the global economic landscape improves and regions continue 5G integration, Fabrinet could be one of the game’s biggest winners.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the stabler side of the spectrum, legacy telecom stock AT&T (NYSE:T) is also emerging as a top 5G stock contender based on its longstanding market penetration and strength, relative stability and dividend and emerging forward-looking 5G initiatives.\n\nOne such growth initiative for AT&T is its sizable stake in and partnership withAST SpaceMobile’s (NASDAQ:ASTS) ambitious project to provide satellite-based cellular services, aiming for a commercial launch in 2024. While this venture may not transform AT&T overnight, it underscores its commitment to exploring new technologies and maintaining competitiveness in a saturated market.\n\nIn its late January earnings report, AT&T disclosed some missed targets but highlighted robust growth areas, such as a nearly 4% increase in wireless service revenue year-over-year. This growth demonstrates AT&T’s ability to navigate economic challenges and expand its customer base through strategic pricing. AT&T added 526,000 postpaid phone subscribers, exceeding the forecasted 487,500, reaffirming its strong market position as national and global customers make the 5G transition.\n\nDespite some views of AT&T as a yield trap, the company maintains a solid 6.7% dividend yield supported by a sustainable 56% payout ratio, continuing to make it an attractive option for dividend-focused investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "20 Fastest Growing Fintech Companies In 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the twenty fastest fintech companies in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the financial technology industry and all the recent trends and developments, then you can take a look at the 5 Fastest Growing Fintech Companies In 2024.\n\nJust like nearly every other industry out there, like industrial manufacturing and healthcare, finance has also been significantly disrupted by the onset of computing. Modern day financial systems are significantly different from what we were used to just a couple of years back. Global inter connectivity has meant that transferring funds worldwide takes just a couple of minutes or days depending on jurisdictions. At the same time, consumers no longer have to go to their banks to access their money since online and internet banking has provided them with greater flexibility.\n\nSimilarly, just as today's banking is vastly different from the past, banks are not the only financial companies that regular consumers and businesses can use to manage their money. A growing sector of the market is dominated by firms that are part of the financial technology industry. These firms can be firms that offer digital wallets, like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), or payment gateways like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Additionally, the global rise in Internet use has also provided humanity with its own set of digital currencies - the most popular of which is the cryptocurrency coin Bitcoin.\n\nLike all other stocks, financial technology stocks are also dependent on the broader market for their performance. For most of these firms, a robust economy is good for price performance. This is due to the nature of their business models. Firms like PayPal and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) benefit from a robust economy because people are more likely to use their services. This means that the firms earn more commission, and as a result, investors also feel more confident in betting on their shares for future growth.\n\nTo see how this works, let's consider Block and PayPal's share price performance over the past 12 months and 2022. Starting from NYSE:SQ, the biggest catalyst to its share price over the past year came in October 2023 when the firm released its earnings results for the third quarter of 2023. This revealed that its premier product, CashApp, doubled monthly active users from June for a fresh tally of two million. This also accompanied an all time record for payment volumes, with the figure jumping to a cool $113 million. Naturally, investors were pleased as the shares soared by 11% in the immediate aftermath of the results.\n\nStory continues\n\nRewinding the hands of time to see how Block's stock was doing in 2022 - when most of the market was convinced that a recession was just on the horizon - the shares sank a stunning 61% during the year. To jog your memory, in 2022 nearly all high growth and technology stocks, whether those in the consumer arena such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or others like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), had tanked and lost double digit percentages in the value due to rapidly rising interest rates and inflation. For Block, the downward spiral started at the tail end of December 2021 when it tried its hand at rebranding and jumped into crypto right at the cusp of Bitcoin's share price crash.\n\nHowever, while Block has done well over the past 12 months, PayPal hasn't fared so well. Despite the fact that falling inflation, rising wages, and artificial intelligence have grown consumer and investor confidence in the stock market and the economy, PayPal is struggling because investors expect it to capture lucrative areas of the transaction processing market such as cross border payments. However, as other sources continue to contribute to growth, the stock is seeing restrained love despite the potential that artificial intelligence offers the payments service and digital wallet provider to streamline its services and reduce fraud. And just like Block, PayPal's shares also bled 62% in 2022, with Q4 2021 earnings igniting a bloodbath after management chose to focus on revenue per user instead of user growth.\n\nYet, the future might be brighter for PayPal, and here's what Wedgewood Partners, had to say about the firm in its fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter:\n\nPayPal Holdings also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company's new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal's rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as 7 the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal's branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's look at some of the fastest growing financial technology companies. A couple of notable picks are Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT), Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), and Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE:LMND). 20 Fastest Growing Fintech Companies In 2024\n\nA person depositing money into an ATM, reflecting the various banking services offered.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the fastest growing financial technology companies in 2024, we ranked the U.S. based holdings of the Global X FinTech ETF by their fiver year annualized revenue growth rate and picked the fintech companies with the fastest growth.

        "title": "25 Most Profitable Companies in the US",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 25 most profitable companies in the US. If you want to skip our overview of the US economy and the current business climate, you can jump ahead to the 5 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\nWith the second quarter of 2024 with us, Wall Street is focused on determining whether companies that are investing in AI are actually bringing in money or whether they are investing costly capital to set themselves up for future growth. Firms that belong to the former sector, i.e. those that are making money from AI, have been rewarded as has been the case with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Just like NVIDIA is Wall Street's favorite AI stock when it comes to semiconductors needed to power up large data processing software, Microsoft is the king of the jungle when it comes to AI software. In the latter segment, the best example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) whose shares have dropped after the latest earnings report revealed that 2024 will require an additional $40 billion in capital to fund AI growth.\n\nThis sharp eye on AI comes when investors are grappling with an economy that might be starting to slow down just as the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to tamp down on inflation. While the AI gold rush of 2023 put inflation and other macroeconomic indicators on the backdrop, after the inflation data for March 2024, they are back in the spotlight. This environment, which has left investors eager to flee away from stocks once again comes as profitability becomes key, particularly as profits are important to enable firms to position themselves for growth (such as is the case with AI stocks) or keep investors happy by paying out dividends.\n\nUS companies are also some of the biggest in the world when it comes to profits. America's corporate sector, particularly the technology industry, is the most developed in the world. Firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are able to compete with the world's largest state owned enterprises when it comes to revenue. In fact, Apple is the first company in the world that has proven that technology and personal computing is a more lucrative industry than oil - a commodity that is responsible for powering daily lives. To understand how, consider that Apple's trailing twelve month revenue as of December 2023 sits at a whopping $385 billion.\n\nNow, compare this with the net sales of the Saudi state owned oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), which has raked in SAR2 trillion during the same time period. Using an exchange rate of 3.75 SAR to a dollar leads to approximately $530 billion in revenue for the Saudi oil giant. While naturally, Aramco's revenue is higher since it does not have any comparable competitors on a global level, the fact that a consumer technology firm that is dependent not only on the need to stay abreast with innovation but also with what its rivals are doing is able to earn more than half of the revenue is something in itself to say the least.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a whole, Insider Monkey also looked at the 30 Largest Companies in the World by Revenue. This shows that US companies reign supreme even though Aramco enjoys free access to the vast global crude oil market. The US retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) tops this list courtesy of its $648 billion in sales, showing that a well run privately owned company has the full potential to take on massive state owned giants.\n\nBut what about profits? After all, even if a firm makes hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, its investors get nothing if money does not flow through the income statement and into retained earnings. Today, we'll look at some of the most profitable companies in America, with a couple of top picks being Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 25 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\nPhoto by Christian Dubovan on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the most profitable companies in the US, we ranked all publicly listed US firms by their trailing twelve month net income available on Yahoo Finance and picked out those with the highest profit.\n\n25 Most Profitable Companies in the US.\n\n25.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 stocks in the S&P 500 by index weight right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the flagship stock index and some recent news for its biggest constituents then you can skip ahead to Top 10 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, politics, and the finance industry. This is because it is one of the most widely followed barometer of the economy, with investors and finance professionals using its data to inform their daily decision making. For politicians, a rising index means that they can boast to voters for having managed the economy well. For finance professionals, they can rest easy knowing that the pricey bets that they might have made on the stock market are doing well.\n\nWhen compared to other indexes, the S&P 500, managed by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), is particularly important because of the stringent conditions that a firm must meet to be included in it. For starters, only sizeable large cap stocks, or those with a market capitalization greater than $18 billion can be included in the index. These large cap stocks must also be highly liquid, generate most of their revenue in America, and of course, be profitable. These criteria remove most firms that might not do well financially, and as a result, the S&P is also recommended as a great passive investment.\n\nShifting to its performance, 2024 has been a fireworks filled year for the S&P 500. The index is up by 6.9% year to date, after it also crossed the illustrious 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history. In fact, year to March 28, 2024 the index had marked 11% in gains, but it ended up losing these after the inflation data for the month led to investors significantly revising their Federal Reserve interest rate cut expectations for 2024.\n\nIn April, while the index did end up revaluing itself in the wake of shifting rate cut paradigms, the first quarter of 2024 earnings season marked by Wall Street's enduring focus on artificial intelligence seems to have injected some life into it. The season, at least as far as artificial intelligence and technology stocks are concerned, started by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) sharing its latest financial performance on April 24th. Meta's results led to tens of billions of dollars in market value being wiped out as investors didn't take too well to $40 billion in AI spending for 2024 at a time when expenses were growing. These were followed by results from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which were more favorably received. If anything, the latest earnings reports have at least stopped the S&P 500 from bleeding further losses, and right now, Wall Street is focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of April.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this meeting is not expected to yield a rate cut, the focus, as always, is on comments made by the Fed after its meetings. These comments help set the tone for future monetary policy actions, and traders will also focus on earnings from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to see whether there's any juice left for more growth. Google parent Alphabet's earnings came with a nice surprise for investors in the form of a dividend, and Wall Street is now focused on whether Amazon will follow suit.\n\nHowever, while the economic picture on the surface might point to fewer Fed interest rate cuts, the S&P 500 might surprise by posting gains if the central bank overshoots market expectations or considers economic weakness more strongly than expected. Just what might force the Fed to swing the other way despite hot inflation and labor costs? Olivia Micklem of Artemis Investment has some insights:\n\nObviously we can see with the data that's been coming through in recent weeks that inflation continues to run hotter than we would have liked to see at this point in the year. That being said, alongside that we are starting to see pockets of weakness in the economy whether that's parts of the consumer economy and other parts of the industrial complex. We got some softer number out of some of the trucking companies last week, for example. So there are indications that some parts of the economy are slowing down. I think we still remain you know cautiously optimistic that there could be an opportunity as we move through the year for the Fed to stay on track with some of their plans to start bringing rates down.\n\nSo, with the S&P 500's future remaining as dynamic as ever, we decided to look at which stocks have been assigned the highest weights by its managers. A few notable ones are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 5 Reasons Why Millionaires Think They’re Middle Class\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the top S&P 500 stocks by weight, we used the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as a proxy and verified the data by the S&P's limited publicly available information about the S&P 500's top ten stocks.\n\nTop 25 Stocks in the S&P 500 by Index Weight Right Now\n\n25.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple will extend a newly introduced core technology fee to iPadOS apps downloaded on its App Store after the operating system for iPads was added to a list of key services subject to EU tech rules, the iPhone maker said on Thursday.\n\nApple in March announced a core technology fee (CTF) of 50 euro cents per user account per year for major app developers even if they do not use any of its payment services or its App Store, with the first 1 million user accounts exempted from the fee.\n\nThe CTF is part of a set of new charges linked to changes to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which requires Apple to open up its closed ecosystem by allowing apps developers to distribute their iPhone apps directly to consumers instead of through its App Store, among other obligations.\n\n\"This week, the European Commission designated iPadOS a gatekeeper platform under the Digital Markets Act. Apple will bring our recent iOS changes for apps in the European Union to iPadOS later this fall, as required,\" the company said in a blogpost.\n\n\"The CTF will also apply to iPadOS apps downloaded through the App Store, Web Distribution, and/or alternative marketplaces,\" it said.\n\nThe company also said small developers with less than 10 million euros ($10.7 million) in global annual business revenue will either pay no CTF or a capped CTF during a three-year period.\n\nDevelopers with no revenues such as students, hobbyists, and developers who create a free app without monetization will not be charged the CTF.\n\nCurrently only developers whose apps do not surpass one million first annual installs per year, non-profit organizations, government entities and educational institutions approved for a fee waiver are exempted from the CTF.\n\n($1 = 0.9360 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Companies have clearly defined goals: to grow their customer base, brand power, and global influence, compete with giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and join the shortlist of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nWhile this sounds great, reaching a trillion-dollar market cap is a tough mountain to climb. Companies on their way to this peak should offer superior products that their clients love and adapt to the market’s continuously evolving needs.\n\nLike anyone wanting to enjoy a comfortable retirement, I, too, would like to own companies that give me that potential. So, in this article, I’ll shortlist three buy-rated companies that I think have the potential to reach the trillion-dollar milestone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo come up with the list, I screened for the following criteria:\n\nCompanies nearing $1 trillion market cap/valuations Buy-rated stocks Double-digit quarterly or yearly revenue growth year over year (according to the latest reporting period)\n\nI then sorted the results from farthest to closest based on their proximity to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a leader in infrastructure software and semiconductor solutions, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a rich history and a reputation as the global leader it is today. With roots from its predecessor, Ma Bell, Broadcom has made its mark as one of the top “go to” companies for cybersecurity, distributed software, mainframe, data management and networking solutions.\n\nBroadcom has further cemented its foothold in the tech sector with its recent acquisition of VMWare, which helps it virtualize desktop operations systems, modernize its customer’s private and hybrid cloud environments, and reach its goal of becoming the world’s number one infrastructure technology firm. Speaking of modernization, Broadcom also has strong connections to AI with its networking products and AI accelerators for AI data centers that solidify its trajectory for growth.\n\nWith a market cap north of $560 billion, I won’t blame you for saying it’s a tad early to think it will reach the trillion-dollar mark anytime soon.\n\nHowever, Broadcom has a strong portfolio of services that can help it cross the finish line.\n\nIts finances aren’t bad either, with Q1 2024 revenue growing 34%.\n\nAccording to AVGO stock’s strong buy recommendation, analysts also appear optimistic about the company’s prospects as one of the next trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is one of today’s largest pharmaceutical companies. Its specializes in oncology, neuroscience, immunology and diabetes medications. Eli Lilly’s strong list of products — Humulin, Cymbalta, Adcirca, Yentreve, and the widely popular Mounjaro and Zepbound — propelled it to greater heights.\n\nWith its market cap currently around $712 billion, Eli Lilly is close to reaching the trillion-dollar milestone thanks to its growth products, promising pipeline, and phase 2 trials of tirzepatide in treating NASH.\n\nThe company’s fiscal year 2023 financials also boasted a 20% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong customer reception of its new products. The company also has a promising outlook with GAAP EPS, which is expected to reach $11.80 to $12.30, and revenue of between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion.\n\nCombine this with the strong buy recommendation from Wall Street experts, and we may have a recipe for another trillion-dollar success.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile almost everyone knows its billionaire owner, Warren Buffet, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) may not be as popular with non-investors. Its operations are structured as a holding company for its subsidiaries in various sectors.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s main strategy focuses on holding stakes in leading companies and buying undervalued businesses that can be derived from its proven and effective value investing philosophy. A recent example is its acquisition of the remaining 20% interest in Pilot Travel Centers LLC from Pilot Corporation (OTCMKTS:POGHF), which has complete ownership.\n\nOf the three on our list, Berkshire Hathaway is the closest to reaching the trillion-dollar milestone, with its market cap around $899 billion.\n\nThe company’s upward trajectory is mostly due to its growth. FY 2023 saw an impressive 21% growth in operating earnings. Net earnings reached $96 billion — a great recovery from last year’s $23 billion loss.\n\nNo wonder analysts like those at UBS main Berkshire Hathaway’s buy rating.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is facing something unusual as it gears up to report its second-quarter results after the close: low expectations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East Jerome Powell Offered Markets a Reprieve. It Vanished in a Blink Tesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market NYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses Biden Calls Ally Japan ‘Xenophobic’ Along With China, Russia\n\nIts reputation as a haven that can outperform in all market conditions has been refuted this year, as it sharply lags peers with better growth, a clearer AI narrative, a cheaper price tag — or all of the above. The upshot is, there may be less room for disappointment with a lowered bar, especially with a massive buyback announcement likely.\n\n“Expectations aren’t very high this quarter, but if we get a better outlook, coupled with some reasons for excitement over AI, we could see the valuation start to expand quite a bit,” said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “It might be tough to count on that, but Apple is a high-quality defensive stock, with a lot of shareholder returns and cash flow. The shareholder returns are the dominant reason to have a position.”\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to add another $90 billion to its repurchase program, suggesting it will follow Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. among the big-tech names that have announced huge buybacks this year. Apple has already spent more than $650 billion buying back its own stock since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe buybacks have been a way for Apple to support earnings. Revenue is expected to fall almost 5% this quarter, which would represent its weakest rate in more than a year, as well as Apple’s fifth quarter of the past six with negative growth. Overall tech revenue is expected to rise 8.6% this quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe growth trends largely reflect the Greater China region, which accounted for nearly 19% of Apple’s 2023 revenue. The company has seen weak China iPhone sales as it loses market share to Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nThe stock is down 12% this year, compared with a gain of 2.9% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Relative to the tech-heavy benchmark, Apple’s underperformance in the first quarter of 2024 was its sharpest in more than a decade.\n\nAnalysts are largely cautious. The consensus for Apple’s full-year revenue has dropped 2.2% over the past quarter, while the view for its net earnings is down 0.8%. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a ratio well below that of other megacap tech.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, such headwinds could be priced into shares following the year-to-date drop. Bernstein upgraded the stock earlier this week, calling the China weakness “more cyclical than structural” and urging investors to “buy the fear.” Similarly, Citi sees a bottom in sentiment.\n\nRead more: Apple Report to Show How It’s Coping With Slowdown: Preview\n\nThe stock hardly scans as a bargain, though, trading near 25 times estimated earnings. While this is notably below a 2020 peak, it is still above its long-term average, as well as the market overall. Furthermore, other megacaps have multiples that are comparable or even lower despite their stronger growth trends.\n\n“It is harder to find an argument to buy Apple compared with the other megacaps,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. “It can’t substantiate growth, it doesn’t have a killer AI strategy, and it isn’t even cheap.”\n\nThe iPhone maker is among the last of the megacaps to report, and the group’s results have been mostly positive. Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. all gained, while Meta Platforms Inc. fell on a mixed revenue forecast and its spending plans. Nvidia Corp, the chipmaker most tied to AI, reports later this month.\n\nRead more: Apple’s OpenAI Talks Intensify as It Seeks to Add AI Features\n\nA common theme for megacap upside has been AI-related demand, an area where Apple is relatively absent. However, it is refocusing its Macs on AI, news that spurred the stock’s best day in nearly a year last month, and it has been in talks with both OpenAI and Alphabet about adding some AI features to the iPhone. More details are expected at an event in June.\n\nIf the results feature any further details on its AI strategy, that could provide additional excitement. Otherwise, an aggressive capital-return strategy could remind investors what they like about Apple amid a backdrop marked by high inflation and uncertainty over Fed policy.\n\n“I’m a long-term Apple bull, and while I’m turning pessimistic about it in the near term, I’m trying to err on the side of optimism,” Morgan said. “Headwinds seem pretty priced in and it has a huge cash hoard, so repurchasing shares and increasing its dividend could reinvigorate interest. However, until it finds a way to really reignite growth, I think the stock could be stuck in the mud.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nSK Hynix Inc. revealed that its capacity to make high-bandwidth memory chips is almost fully booked through next year, underscoring the intense demand for semiconductors essential to artificial intelligence development. The firm is aiming to keep ahead of Samsung Electronics Co. in providing advanced components, which work alongside Nvidia Corp. accelerators in creating and hosting AI platforms.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nUniversal Music Group NV, the world’s biggest record label, said it has entered a new licensing agreement with TikTok, ending a dispute that led to its artists’ songs being pulled from the social media platform. Intel Corp. is attempting a comeback with massive spending on new factories and lots of help from the Biden administration. Qualcomm Inc., the world’s biggest seller of smartphone processors, gave an upbeat forecast for sales and profit in the current period, suggesting demand for handsets is increasing after a two-year slump. Elon Musk’s latest cost-cutting victims: summer interns. Tesla Inc. is rescinding offers just weeks before internships were set to start, prompting aspiring employees to take to LinkedIn to appeal to other employers to take them in.

        "content": "As an investor, tech stocks have been an appealing choice over the last year as excitement about products such as generative AI pushed the sector higher. But not all are winners. Tech stocks that are not performing well or facing challenges, knowing when to sell can be even more critical.\n\nRather than holding on and hoping for a turnaround, it’s a better strategy to use the Portfolio Grader as a guide to help identify tech stocks to sell.\n\nUnderperforming tech stocks can be a real drain on your portfolio, dragging down your overall returns and keeping you from capitalizing on more promising stocks. The market is full of A-rated tech stocks, so why would you hold on to an underperformer?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf a stock is consistently underperforming or facing fundamental issues, it may be a sign that it is unlikely to recover soon. Holding onto such stocks, hoping for a turnaround, can lead to further losses.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader’s easy-to-use format makes it a breeze to identify tech stocks to sell. The Grader ranks every stock based on its earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment, momentum and other factors to determine a letter grade of “A” through “F.”\n\nBy using the Portfolio Grader to help you identify tech stocks to sell, you can make some changes and keep your positive returns coming – and give you a better chance to meet your long-term investing goals.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has long been a bellwether company that drove the tech community. With a market capitalization of $2.6 billion, Apple ranks as the No. 2 company in the world by market cap.\n\nIt’s obviously an important company and you should be keeping a close eye on it. But it’s also been a disappointment to investors – and there are hazards looming ahead.\n\nSales are falling in China, where the smartphone maker faces new competition from Huawei and its 5G phone. Regulators in the U.S. and U.K. are also deep into investigations that Apple uses the App Store to stymie competition – and that could have a huge impact on Apple’s bottom line moving forward.\n\nWhile Apple continues to see solid growth from its Services segment, product growth was flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. When Apple reports Q2 earnings on May 2, investors should be looking at those numbers closely. But I’m not expecting a turnaround.\n\nAAPL stock is down 11% in 2024. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) A Baidu (BIDU) sign outside a company office in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Chinese technology company that has a dominant share in China’s search engine market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is positioning itself as an artificial intelligence company by offering a full AI stack that includes AI chips, a deep learning framework, natural language processing, speech recognition and augmented reality. Its Baidu Brain AI technology engine is used to help develop new AI businesses.\n\nBut for all of its innovation and its embrace of AI, Baidu doesn’t perform as well as it should – and people are noticing. Earnings for the fourth quarter included revenue growth of just 6%, to 34.95 billion yuan ($4.92 billion). That was below analysts’ consensus estimates of 34.97 billion yuan.\n\nIn addition, Baidu reported monthly average users of 667 million, which was only a 3% increase from a year ago.\n\nBIDU stock is down 13% this year. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square (SQ) logo displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFormerly known as Square, Block (NYSE:SQ) is a technology computer software company that’s best known for the plastic dongles that insert into a smartphone or tablet, allowing small market vendor to process credit card transactions.\n\nBlock also performs a crypto company and has a sizable investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD), owning more than 8,000 of the digital currency at a valuation of more than $450 million. The recent rise in Bitcoin was a major factor in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings, in which Block reported $562 million in earnings – and $207 million of that was from Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, there are issues that keeps Block’s rating in the Portfolio Grader down. The company isn’t consistent with profits – it posted a net loss in 202 of $541 million. The only reason it broke into the black in 2023 (with income of $9.8 million) was because it had an uncommonly strong fourth quarter.\n\nWhile analysts are expecting operating income of $1.1 billion this year, I’m not fully sold that Block will be able to find the consistency it needs to be a top tech stock. And if the price of Bitcoin falters again – SQ stock will fall along with it.\n\nSQ stock is down 5% this year and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSea Limited (SE) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a computer software and internet company based in Singapore. The company is best known for its Free Fire game, which is a free-to-play battle royale game much like Fortnite.\n\nIt also operates an e-commerce segment called Shopee that operates in Southeast Asia and Brazil. And while the combination of a gaming company/e-commerce platform worked during the Covid-19 pandemic, both companies suffered some growing pains when COVID lockdowns ended.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $3.6 billion, up 4.8% from a year ago – which is OK, but not great for a technology company in today’s market. Profits of $1.5 billion were down from $1.7 billion a year ago.\n\nThe company also posted a net loss of $111.6 million, which was a change from a profit of $422.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nSE stock is up big this year, but note that its stock price is still down 17% over the last 12 months and is still 82% from its pandemic highs. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBilibili (BILI) picture of bilibili (BILI) logo on a phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) is a video sharing website that operates only in China. That means if you are wanting to check it out from the U.S. or elsewhere, you’d have to use a VPN service to get to the Bilibili site.\n\nUsers are able to post videos and comment on others – it’s essentially like YouTube. But YouTube has a much bigger audience and is much more accessible, which makes Bilibili a questionable investment at best.\n\nThe company has 336 million monthly active users and 100 million daily active users. YouTube has 2.49 billion monthly active users.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $894.3 million, up 3% from a year ago. The company posted a net loss of $182.6 million for the quarter.\n\nWhile Bilibili is showing some modest growth, it’s a relatively weak stock in the technology sector. If you are looking for a tech investment, you can surely do better.\n\nBILI stock remains down 37% in the last 12 months, and has only gained 3% in 2024. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMaxLinear (MXL) A hand holding a phone that shows the MaxLinear (MXL) logo.\n\nSource: T.

The company makes analog, digital and mixed signal circuits, plus wireless infrastructure.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of 2024 continued the company’s depressing story. Revenue was $95.3 million, which was down 62% from a year ago and 24% from the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company posted a GAAP loss of 88 cents per share, which was a worsening from a loss of 47 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThe forecast isn’t much better. MaxLinear is guiding for Q2 revenue between $90 million and $110 million, and operating expenses of $103 million to $113 million. So investors are likely looking at another loss.\n\nMXL stock is down 12% this year. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAmkor Technology (AMKR) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it.

That means there’s not as much business for Amkor, and the company’s revenue and profits show it.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue was $1.36 billion, down from $1.47 billion a year ago. On the positive side, the company was more efficient than a year ago with an operating margin of 5.4% versus 4.7%. That means that Amkor had income of $59 million and 24 cents per share, versus $45 million and 18 cents per share last year.\n\nAmkor is going to continue to be reliant on other industries that are currently struggling. That’s more than enough reason to stay away.\n\nAMKR stock is down 2% in 2024.

        "content": "Chip stocks pulled back following an earnings report by ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), a prominent semiconductor manufacturing equipment developer, which said it expects its bookings to see a significant 61% sequential decrease in the first quarter.\n\nThis downturn surpassed what investors had anticipated, causing concern in the semiconductor market. This slowdown in equipment purchases by foundries, that manufacture chips for companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could indicate a potential downturn in the semiconductor industry, which is what is hurting chip stocks lately.\n\nThe semiconductor sector was further shaken by a global retreat in semiconductor stocks, prompted by profit-taking after TSMC revised its chip market growth forecast downwards. The revision by TSMC, from over 10% to 10% growth for the global logic semiconductor industry, is fueling concerns over the demand for chips used in various technologies including electric vehicles, computers, and smartphones.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith the latest pullback, let’s look at three chip stocks investors may want to buy on dips.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) produces DRAM, flash memory, and SSDs, which are essential for everything from smartphones to data centers. This positive performance has made Micron a standout in the broader chip stocks category.\n\nInvestors should use the recent pullback in Micron as an opportunity.\n\nMicron reported an unexpected profit for its second quarter, signaling a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in the memory chip market. It also transitioned to a profit of $793 million. That was a substantial turnaround from the $2.31 billion loss reported in the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company earned 71 cents per share, defying analysts’ expectations of a per-share loss of 41 cents, according to polls by FactSet. Adjusted earnings per share stood at 42 cents, outperforming the consensus forecast of a 25-cent loss.\n\nThe company enjoyed a 58% increase in revenue, reaching $5.82 billion, which surpassed analyst predictions. In addition, Micron’s Chief Executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, attributed this success to the company’s effective execution in terms of pricing, products, and operations.\n\nLooking ahead, the company’s revenue forecast ranges from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, which exceeds the consensus expectations of $6 billion. This optimistic outlook further underscores the company’s recovery trajectory in the competitive memory chip market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) used to be known for creating powerful graphics chips for gaming PCs and workstations. However, the unprecedented demand for high-end AI chips is what propelled the company’s market capitalization to over $2 trillion at one point.\n\nWithin a single year, Nvidia gained a 260% valuation boost, increasing its market cap by $1.6 trillion. That is more than double the combined market cap of Nvidia’s three closest competitors. Their chips accelerate tasks in AI, data science, and self-driving cars.\n\nNvidia shares are already up 77% but were recently trading below highs following a pullback in the chip sector. Still, investors are very likely to continue seeing Nvidia as the clear artificial intelligence (AI) winner as long as the company can maintain its ~90% market share in this market.\n\nThe company’s stock was also boosted when Citi analysts opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the chipmaker. According to the firm, recent supply chain checks showed that Nvidia’s visibility has extended into 1H25, which makes it a long-term core portfolio holding.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

The company designs and sells servers, storage, and other hardware needed for data centers and powerful computing systems. As part of the broader chip stocks sector, SMCI’s role is crucial for advanced computing needs.\n\nThe company’s stock fell as much as 23% in a single day in April after the maker of servers announced the date of its third-quarter results but didn’t pre-announce results. This disappointed investors as they were hoping SMCI could opt to pre-announcer results amid better-than-expected performance in the first quarter.\n\nNevertheless, the SMCI’s strong fundamental profile remains intact. The selloff is more connected to heightened investor expectations than to the change in the company’s performance. In recent months, SMCI stock has rallied on the back of the generative AI boom. Investors see SMCI well-positioned amid strong demand for its AI-centric server technology.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offers a diversified approach for investors looking to build wealth in the stock market. While the S&P 500 is the most prominent investment vehicle for growth, many investors want exposure to the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500.\n\nIn order to identify the top ETFs for outperformance, one must focus on factors such as low expense ratios, strong historical performance, and alignment with emerging trends. This can be in areas like clean energy, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. If you’re willing to take on a little more risk, these 3 ETFs might be worthy of taking a closer look.\n\nNow, let’s discover the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500 through 2030!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) AI.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is a leading ETF focusing on the semiconductor sector. It has been on a tear this year as demand for advanced semiconductor chips remains exceptionally strong.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is a premier investment option due to its relatively low expense ratio of 0.35% and focus on the semiconductor industry. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, semiconductors will continue to serve as the backbone of innovation. It will power everything from smartphones to advanced AI applications.\n\nFurthermore, it will also be fueled by trends such as 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and electric vehicles. The ETF’s top 5 largest holdings include industry giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nThey account for approximately 50% of the portfolio’s net assets under management. It has also returned 264% compared to the S&P 500’s 70% over the last 5 years.\n\nInvesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (SPHQ) Piggy banks with coins in them that spell out ETF.\n\nSource: Maxx-Studio / Shutterstock\n\nInvesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHQ) stands out as one of the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500 over the next decade. The ETF focuses on high-quality companies exhibiting strong fundamentals, stable earnings and robust balance sheets.\n\nThe Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF’s asset allocation strategy is incredibly diverse. It includes a mixture of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap equities across various sectors. However, information technology holds the largest mix accounting for approximately 35% of the ETF’s total weight. By spreading across multiple sectors, the fund can reduce the overall risk to any one company.\n\nAdditionally, its passive management style means lower expense ratios which is currently 0.15%. The ETF’s top 5 largest holdings are Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith exposure to quality small, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks, the cost-effectiveness of this ETF makes it a strong contender for outperformance.\n\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (XMMO) A concept image of a board with stock prices with the word \"momentum\" in the middle. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: iQoncept / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Invesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:XMMO) is a premier investment option for several compelling reasons. Mainly, the ETF’s large exposure to midcap stocks with the potential for significant gains.\n\nMid-cap stocks within the S&P 500 index provide investors with exposure to a diversified portfolio poised for growth. They often exhibit higher growth potential than their large-cap counterparts. Moreover, they also offer greater stability than small-cap investments, striking a balance that appeals to many investors seeking both growth and stability.\n\nThe ETF has far outperformed the S&P 500 in 2024, rising 22.5% compared to the S&P’s 6.24%. Its expense ratio remains relatively low, at just 0.34%. Additionally, its top five largest holdings account for approximately 16% of the ETFs total weight. If you have a little more tolerance for risk, XMMO is certainly one of the best ETFs to beat the S&P 500 through 2030.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It's been a tough year for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) investors. The company posted year-over-year sales declines for four consecutive quarters before finally returning to positive growth. Lackluster sales and fears about the iPhone's fading relevance in China have some investors fearing the worst.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst believes investors are missing the forest for the trees.\n\nFocus on the long term\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives reaffirmed his price target of $250 on Apple while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the stock. This suggests a potential upside of roughly 47% over the coming year, compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nWhile Ives acknowledges the next couple of quarters will be \"soft\" for Apple, he believes this is a temporary stumbling block. \"The good news is help is on the way,\" Ives wrote, \"as we believe a pent-up demand cycle with an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven iPhone 16 model [is] on the horizon.\"\n\nThe analyst has a point. iPhone sales have always been cyclical, with excitement waning between major updates. Furthermore, limited performance upgrades for the iPhone 15 and tough macroeconomic headwinds have conspired to weigh on sales, which have been tepid by Apple standards. But the devil is in the details.\n\nDespite weaker sales, Apple took seven of the top 10 spots on the global list of bestselling smartphones in 2023, according to Counterpoint Research. This suggests a slump in overall smartphone sales, not just the iPhone. Furthermore, when money is tight, consumers tend to trade down to less expensive substitutes, which helps explain Apple's weaker revenue.\n\nA long track record of growth at a discount\n\nApple has an unrivaled installed base of 2.2 billion active iOS devices. This gives the company a captive audience for its ancillary products and services. Furthermore, iPhone users are extraordinarily loyal, and history shows they're highly unlikely to switch to a competing device.\n\nFinally, at just 28 times earnings, Apple is comparable to the price-to-earnings ratio of 27 for the S&P 500, with much greater potential upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. paid Apple Inc. $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser, according to newly unsealed court documents in the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTesla Axes Supercharger Team in Blow to Broader EV Market US and Saudis Near Defense Pact Meant to Reshape Middle East NYPD Arrests Over 300 Protesters in Crackdown on College Campuses The Ozempic Effect: How a Weight Loss Wonder Drug Gobbled Up an Entire Economy Treasuries Rally With Fed Not as Hawkish as Feared: Markets Wrap\n\nThe deal between the two tech giants is at the heart of the landmark case, in which antitrust enforcers allege Google has illegally monopolized the market for online search and related advertising. The Justice Department and Google will offer closing arguments in the case Thursday and Friday, with a decision expected later this year.\n\nGoogle and Apple had hoped to shield the payment amount from public disclosure. At the trial last fall, Apple executives testified that Google paid “billions,” without specifying a number. A Google witness later accidentally disclosed that Google pays 36% of the revenue it earns from search ads to Apple.\n\nCourt documents filed late Tuesday ahead of the closing arguments mark the first public confirmation of the figures by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue. Such numbers aren’t disclosed by either company in their securities filings. The documents also revealed the importance of the payments to Apple’s bottom line. For instance, in 2020, Google’s payments to Apple constituted 17.5% of the iPhone maker’s operating income.\n\nThe agreement with Apple is the most important of Google’s default deals, since it sets the search engine for the most used smartphone in the US.\n\nApple first agreed to use Google in the Safari browser in 2002 for free. But the companies later decided to share revenue made from search advertising. By May 2021, that translated to Google paying Apple more than $1 billion a month for its default status, prosecutors said in the filing.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., which operates competing search engine Bing, has repeatedly tried to entice Apple away from its relationship with Google. The company offered to share 90% of its advertising revenue with Apple to make Bing the default in Safari, according to the court documents. Those figures also weren’t previously disclosed.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella testified at the trial last year that the company was willing to make a number of concessions, including hiding the Bing brand, to persuade Apple to make the switch, which he said would be “game changing.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Whomever they choose, they king-make,” Nadella said of Apple.\n\n--With assistance from Davey Alba, Mark Gurman and Dina Bass.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, as Wall Street braces for what is the potential of be a sizable drop in iPhone sales out of China. According to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales fell 19% in the quarter, while rival Huawei continued to regain its footing after the U.S. attempted to kneecap the company by keeping it from accessing US chips in 2019.\n\nThe anticipated pullback in iPhone shipments follows back-to-back quarters of revenue declines out of Greater China, one of Apple’s most important sales regions. For Q2, revenue is set to drop 28% year-over-year.\n\nShares of Apple are off some 5% year to date and roughly flat over the last 12 months. Shares of Big Tech rivals like Microsoft and Google, meanwhile, are up 25% and 37% over the last year, respectively.\n\nFor the quarter, Apple is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 on revenue of $90.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to a 4.75% year-over-year revenue decline.\n\nApple’s iPhone revenue is anticipated to drop some 10.8% to $45.75 billion in the quarter, while iPad revenue is set to fall 11%. Analysts also anticipate both Mac and Wearables to decline 5% year-over-year.\n\n“At this point, expectations are pretty darn low,” Dan Niles, founder of Niles Investment Management told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n“Competition from China isn’t going away, they’re late to AI, and unfortunately, you’re paying a pretty high PE multiple at 25 times for a company whose March quarter revenues they guided to is exactly the same as three years ago,” he added. Apple CEO Tim Cook will update Wall Street about the state of the company during its Q2 earnings call after the bell Thursday. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nBut there are some potential bright spots for Apple in the quarter. Services revenue is expected to grow 11% year-over-year to $23.28 billion. Analysts also anticipate gross margin will improve 5% year-over-year to 46.59%.\n\nApple is also gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June where it will reportedly unveil the latest versions of its iOS, macOS, watchOS, iPadOS, and visionOS operating systems. One of the biggest announcements at the show will likely be how Apple will integrate generative AI into its various products.\n\nThe company is late to the generative AI party, with rivals across Big Tech already rolling out their own product offerings to consumers and enterprise customers. But that doesn’t mean Apple has been twiddling its thumbs. The company has been busy buying up AI firms and building its own large language model to potentially power its AI efforts.\n\nApple is also looking to work with OpenAI, Google, and others to get its AI offerings up to snuff, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI is still a relatively niche product among consumers. Sure, Google and Samsung offer generative AI capabilities on their smartphones, and PC makers are increasingly leaning into so-called AI PCs, but the applications still feel largely like tech demos rather than game-changing features that will significantly drive sales. Apple has the opportunity to change that.\n\nBut first it needs to get through earnings. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Analyst Upgrades: 3 Stocks That the Pros Can’t Stop Raving About",
        "content": "Sell-side analysts have ratings on specific stocks, and based on them, they recommend to clients whether they should buy, sell or stay away from them. Analyst upgrades and downgrades can significantly influence the stock market, affecting both stocks with analyst upgrades, individual stock prices and broader market sentiment.\n\nFor example, when an analyst upgrades a stock, he/she is suggesting a stronger performance or more favorable outlook than previously anticipated. As a result, this action often leads to an immediate increase in the stock price. That happens because the upgrade is seen as a validation of the company’s potential, making the stock more attractive to investors.\n\nConversely, a downgrade can lead to a quick decline in the stock price, as it signals concerns about the company’s prospects or macro headwinds.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUpgrades and downgrades also affect overall investor sentiment. An upgrade can boost confidence, leading more investors to buy into not only the specific stock but sometimes also the sector or the market as a whole.\n\nSimilarly, a downgrade might raise caution, prompting selling activity that extends beyond the individual stock to other similar stocks or sectors. Stocks might swing widely as investors react to new information and adjust their positions accordingly.\n\nWhile the immediate effects of upgrades and downgrades are noticeable, their long-term impact can be more balanced. Here we look at three stocks that saw their prices move in recent days on the back of the hot Wall Street analyst upgrades.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple, Inc. (AAPL) logo\n\nBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, highly respected on Wall Street for his cautious approach, upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock’s rating from Market Perform to Outperform, maintaining a price target of $195.00. The upgrade places Apple among other stocks with analyst upgrades, attracting investor attention.\n\nSacconaghi’s analysis comes at a critical time when Apple stock has traded under pressure, primarily due to a disappointing iPhone 15 cycle and ongoing concerns about its business in China. Additionally, Apple experienced a sharp 24% drop in iPhone sales in China during the first six weeks of 2024, amidst tough competition and pricing challenges.\n\nThe analyst believes the issues in China are cyclical rather than structural, emphasizing that Apple’s operations in the region have historically been more volatile due to its consumer base’s high sensitivity to new features.\n\nHe anticipates that upcoming improvements, including much-anticipated generative AI features in the next iPhone iteration, could significantly bolster Apple’s market position. That is very likely to lead to a re-rating in Apple stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBernstein projects a robust growth in iPhone sales, estimating a 10% year-over-year increase to 248 million units in 2025, surpassing the consensus forecast. Heading into the second quarter results, Sacconaghi suggests the guidance of approximately $80 billion in revenue for FQ3 could act as a pivotal moment for Apple stock.\n\n“We believe guidance could serve as a clearing event for the stock, similar to 2023 and 2019,” the analyst said.\n\n“Moreover, AAPL is entering its seasonally strong trading period — the stock has outperformed in the 3 months leading into the iPhone launch in 15 of the last 17 years and by an average of 1,280 bps.”\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nHSBC analyst Mohammed Khallouf double upgradedSnap (NYSE:SNAP) stock, elevating the rating from a Reduce to a Buy rating. This rate, a significant shift in the analyst’s rating system, reflects a positive outlook driven by several key factors identified by HSBC analysts. Snap shares surged last week on the back of the stronger-than-expected earnings report.\n\nThe analyst points to a broad-based recovery in global advertising demand and pricing as a primary catalyst for the upgrade. Moreover, Snap’s direct-response advertising solutions are gaining increased traction, contributing to the company’s revenue growth.\n\nAnother positive indicator is the continuing momentum of Snap+, the platform’s subscription service, adding to its financial stability.\n\nKhallouf has raised his price target for Snap to $15.10, based on a revised revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) forecast for 2023 to 2028, which he increased from 12% to 15%.\n\nOn the risks side, the analyst mentioned the fragile macroeconomic recovery, potential competitive gains from increased AI investment by rivals, and internal competition where Snap’s newer “Spotlight” product could cannibalize its higher-margin formats.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn another major move last week, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst John Murphy upgraded Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) from Neutral to Buy while maintaining a price target of $220.00. This analyst move follows Tesla’s Q1 results, which surpassed expectations and provided clarity on several concerns that investors had before the earnings release. The upgrade places Tesla among other prominent stocks with analyst upgrades, reflecting a bullish sentiment.\n\nMurphy highlights that the better-than-anticipated results, combined with reassuring comments from Tesla’s management, are helping to improve the sentiment on Tesla stock. These factors have contributed to a more favorable outlook for Tesla, prompting the upgrade.\n\nThe analyst sees a “windup of positive catalysts” building for the electric vehicle (EV) company. That path likely includes upcoming product launches, potential market expansions and technological advancements (like self-driving technology) that could further drive Tesla’s stock price upwards, BofA said.\n\nOn the other hand, Bank of America’s upgrade move comes despite a series of senior executives who have reportedly left the company in recent weeks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

        "content": "After Nvidia and Apple, Alibaba Chases Vietnam: New Data Center to Boost Control and Meet Local Laws\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) plans to construct a data center in Vietnam to meet legal requirements for local data storage and to cater to increasing demand in one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies.\n\nCurrently, Alibaba rents server space from Vietnamese state-owned telecommunications companies Viettel and VNPT.\n\nThe arrangement follows Vietnam’s contentious 2022 law mandating that companies store data within the country—a regulation that sparked resistance from major tech firms like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the Nikkei Asia reports.\n\nDang Minh Tam, Alibaba Cloud’s solution architect lead, noted that the company uses colocation services from these state companies to store client data locally. It also maintains backups across its server farms in regions including Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nThe move is part of Alibaba’s strategy to ensure better security and control over its data and potentially reduce costs and liability issues associated with multi-company data management.\n\nCompanies including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) have reached out to Vietnam to diversify their supply chain base amid heightening geopolitical tensions between the US and China.\n\nLam Research weighed the supply chain shift to Vietnam, with the Vietnamese government canvassing the former to commit $1 billion to local production efforts.\n\nApple suppliers in Vietnam increased by 40% to 35 in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia tapped Vietnamese tech firms for AI development.\n\nAlibaba stock lost over 11% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Will Apple Beat on Q2 Earnings Amid iPhone Slump? ETFs in Focus",
        "content": "All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on May 2. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\r\n\r\nApple shares are down about 7.6% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 3.9%. The trend is expected to reverse, given that the tech giant has a reasonable chance to beat earnings estimates. It saw positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nThis has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nInside Our Methodology\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal second quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year decline of 0.7% for earnings and 5.1% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nThe stock has a top Growth Score of A. It currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations. Of the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60.71% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.\r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $204.88. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nOn the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year’s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up with demand (read: Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings).\n\nAre Apple iPhone Sales a Concern?\n\nApple stock has been struggling with concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Sales of its flagship product are facing significant headwinds in the crucial Chinese market due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers as well as national security concerns. Additionally, consumers globally are holding their iPhone devices for longer before upgrading, further weighing on demand and sales growth.\r\n\r\nAccording to the preliminary data from research firm IDC, Apple lost its crown to South Korean rival Samsung as the world’s biggest mobile phone seller after its shipments fell about 10% in the quarter ended March. Samsung retook the lead in the global market with a 20.8% share, beating Apple’s 17.3% share, which has been dented by slowing sales in China.\r\n\r\nIDC revealed that Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones in the quarter ended March, down from the 55.4 million units in the year-ago quarter. It was the biggest drop in iPhone sales since COVID-19 lockdowns caused global supply chain chaos in 2022. A separate new report from market research firm Counterpoint Research shows that Apple’s iPhone sales dropped sharply by 19.1% year over year in the quarter ended March in China amid strong competition from domestic brand Huawei.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. It holds about 65 securities in its basket, with Apple making up 20.3% share. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has key holdings in software, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, and technology hardware, storage and peripherals (read: Forget Meta-Led Slump: 3 Reasons to Buy Tech ETFs on the Dip).\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund is the most popular and heavily traded ETF, with an AUM of $62.7 billion and an average daily volume of 7 million shares. The fund charges 9 bps in fees per year.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF manages $62.6 billion in its asset base and provides exposure to 313 technology stocks. It currently tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. Here, Apple accounts for a 15.4% share. Semiconductors, systems software, technology hardware storage & peripheral, and application software are the top four sectors.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%, whereas volume is solid at nearly 433,000 shares.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC)\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF is home to 303 technology stocks with an AUM of $9.3 billion. It follows the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology Index. Apple accounts for a 15.4% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF has an expense ratio of 0.08%, while volume is solid at 246,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW)\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index, giving investors exposure to 131 U.S. electronics, computer software and hardware, and informational technology companies. Apple makes up 15.3% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF has an AUM of $15.7 billion and charges 40 bps in fees and expenses. Volume is good as it exchanges 931,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK)\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF offers diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market. It tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index and holds 79 securities in its basket, with Apple accounting for 11.9% of the total assets (read: Should You Buy the Dip in Magnificent 7 ETFs Before Q1 Earnings?).\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF charges 7 bps in annual fees and trades in a good volume of around 303,000 shares a day on average.

        "content": "Cloudflare NET is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 2, after market close.\n\nThe company projects first-quarter revenues of $372.5-$373.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is pegged at $372.9 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 28.5%.\n\nCloudflare expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 13 cents for the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is also pegged at 13 cents per share, implying an improvement of 62.5% from the year-ago quarter’s 8 cents.\n\nThe web infrastructure and website security solution provider projects non-GAAP income from operations between $34 million and $35 million. NET’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 56.9%.\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nCloudflare, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nCloudflare, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cloudflare, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nCloudflare’s first-quarter performance is likely to have gained from organizations transitioning from traditional firewall and VPN-based cybersecurity solutions to the zero-trust approach. The company’s performance is expected to have benefited from the growing hybrid working trend that needs organizations to secure networks beyond on-premise.\n\nThe top line is expected to have gained from accelerated global expansion outside the United States. It is worth mentioning that the company had generated approximately 47.5% of its fourth-quarter 2023 revenues outside the United States.\n\nA diversified clientele is likely to have boosted Cloudflare’s first-quarter top line. NET added around 7,764 new paying customers in the fourth quarter of 2023, bringing the total count to approximately 189,791.\n\nThe company also added 198 new large customers (annual billings of more than $100,000), taking the total count to 2,756 at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 2,558 recorded at the end of the third quarter of 2023. This rise in customer base has prevailed for the past 10 quarters. This is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by the increasing demand for the company’s cloud-based offerings amid the continuing digitalizing trend.\n\nThe company’s recurring subscription-based business model has been providing relative stability to its top line amid the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues. However, NET’s high exposure to small and medium businesses is likely to have weighed on its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cloudflare this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that is not the case here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNET has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Arista Networks ANET, Docebo DCBO and Apple AAPL have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nArista Networks has an Earnings ESP of +2.49% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nShares of Arista Networks have gained 8.9% year to date.

DCBO is slated to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 9.\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nShares of Apple have lost 11.5% year to date.

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, to be reported on May 2, are expected to reflect the benefits of an improving PC market, as well as steady growth in the Services business.\r\n\r\nThe PC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.\r\n\r\nLenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively.

        "title": "Is a Surprise Coming for Apple (AAPL) This Earnings Season?",
        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Apple Inc. AAPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.52 per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.93% heading into earnings season.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Apple, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Top 20 Tech Companies in Silicon Valley",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 technology companies in Silicon Valley. If you want to skip our coverage of the world's technology hub and a region that has changed the world as we know it, then check out 5 Top Tech Companies in Silicon Valley.\n\nIf there's one thing that 2024 has made sure it's that Silicon Valley isn't going anywhere. The sector that gave us the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the smartphone is now leading the charge with a set of technologies called artificial intelligence. Typically the domain of science fiction, AI is a collection of techniques that fall under the category of data science. It is the most advanced kind of data science there is, as the software is programmed to learn from voluminous data sets to generate and create insights of its own.\n\nThe close of the first quarter of 2024 also provided Wall Street the ability to take stock of where some of the biggest technology companies in the world, most of which are in Silicon Valley, are when it comes to artificial intelligence. Big ticket technology and AI companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) report their earnings for the first quarter of 2024. These results primarily focused on the costs that the companies had incurred for their AI platforms in Q1 and also their plans for further spending this year.\n\nOne of the first firms to report its earnings was the Facebook parent Meta. Its shares tanked by 16% in aftermarket hours on the day of the earnings report, as Wall Street digested a multi billion dollar AI capital expenditure plan for 2024 and saw costs grow for the first time after two consecutive quarters. Alphabet sought to assure investors of its stability, as it became yet another technology stock to declare a dividend. An additional source of income is almost always welcomed by investors, and Alphabet's shares soared by more than 10% in aftermarket, even as its peer Microsoft demonstrated mixed share price performance despite being one of the strongest performers on the artificial intelligence front.\n\nDelving deeper into Silicon Valley giant Alphabet's earnings, the firm known for being Google's parent, announced a 20 cent dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback. Both of these are great for helping the share price, and since its earnings report, Alphabet's stock is by 6% after shedding some of its 10% gains in post earnings gains during regular trading hours. On the revenue front, Alphabet brought in $80 billion while it raked in $1.81 on the EPS front. Both of these beat analyst estimates that had stood at $78.59 billion and $1.59, and coupled with $61.7 billion in advertising revenue that surged past estimates of $60.2 billion meant that the latest set of results was rather well rounded.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the hardware side of things, Intel, which is one of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in the world, is currently focusing on the leading edge side of the industry. The firm has lost its chip manufacturing race to the Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and in April 2024, it announced the 'first light' for the world's most advanced chip making machine, a high NA EUV scanner. First light refers to the first time that a chip making machine is turned on, and the event typically marks the end of countless hours of work spent in setting up the complex machines.\n\nAs for AI, here's what the management of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), another Silicon Valley firm, had to say during its Q1 2024 earnings:\n\nWe’re bringing generative AI to Adobe Experience Cloud and will demonstrate our AI Assistant for Customer Experience Management at Adobe Summit. Every student, communicator, creative professional and marketer is now focused on leveraging generative AI to imagine, ideate, create and deliver content and applications across a plethora of channels. Adobe is uniquely positioned through the combination of Express, Firefly, Creative Cloud, Acrobat and Experience Cloud to deliver on this immense market opportunity. The success we are already seeing with our GenStudio offering in the enterprise is validation of our leadership, and we expect that success to translate into other segments as we roll out these solutions throughout the year. We are driving strong usage, value and demand for our AI solutions across all customer segments.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top technology companies in Silicon Valley.

        "title": "Apple set for big sales decline as investors await AI in iPhones",
        "content": "By Yuvraj Malik\n\n(Reuters) - Apple's plan to add generative AI to its iPhones and revive sagging sales in the crucial Chinese market will be in focus on Thursday, when the tech giant is expected to report its biggest quarterly revenue decline in more than a year.\n\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling more than 10% year to date as fears mount about its slow roll out of AI services and as a resurgent Huawei takes market share in China.\n\nAnalysts on average see iPhone sales, which account for about half of Apple's revenue, falling 10.4% in the first three months of 2024, according to LSEG. That drop would be the steepest in more than three years.\n\nAnalysts estimate Apple's total revenue declined 5% in its second quarter, which included January through March. That would be Apple's biggest revenue decline since the December-quarter of 2022, when revenue fell 5.5%.\n\nApple earlier this year lost the crown of the world's most valuable company to Microsoft and its market value now stands at $2.68 trillion after the decline in its share price in 2024.\n\nWeak revenue and falling shares have put pressure on Apple to spruce up its flagship device after years without major upgrades.\n\nThe company is in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google to add genAI features for the iPhone that could be unveiled at what is expected to be its biggest-ever annual developer conference in June, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nAnalysts believe such an AI integration could drive demand for the next iPhone series, expected to be announced in the fall.\n\nWhile executives at Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other major technology firms have talked up their AI strategies on quarterly conference calls in recent months, Apple CEO Tim Cook has discussed his plans for the emerging technology much less.\n\nAdding AI features to iPhones could also help Apple to compete better with Huawei and Samsung Electronics, which reclaimed the title of the world's top smartphone vendor from Apple earlier this year, driven by demand for the AI features in its Galaxy S24 smartphones.\n\n\"Replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said this week, upgrading his rating on the company's shares to \"outperform\" from \"market-perform\".\n\n\"We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note historically Apple's China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday's earnings will also be watched closely for updates on the company's stock buyback plan and the Vision Pro, Apple's first major product in years that hit the shelves in February.\n\nAfter initial enthusiasm, there have been signs that demand slowed for the $3,500 device, with an analyst saying this month that Apple has pulled back its production estimates for the mixed-reality headset.\n\nThe rest of the company's hardware business is also reeling from soft demand, with iPads and Mac sales expected to fall 11.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the March quarter.\n\nApple has signaled it is sharpening its focus on the devices, which have also been hobbled by a lack of major upgrades.\n\nThe company is hosting an event later this month where a revamped iPad line-up is expected to be unveiled and media reports have said that it plans to update every Mac model with faster, AI-focused M4 processors.\n\nThe services business - which includes money earned from App Store and subscription services such as Apple TV - is expected to remain a bright spot with revenue growth of 7.7%.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 ETFs to Buy When the Market Gets Crazy",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds can be your best friend during times of volatility, which brings us to ETFs to buy. Primarily, the casting of a wide net enables you to cover much more ground than you can hope for selecting individual securities.\n\nSecond, the very nature of ETFs help mitigate downside risk. If one idea within the basket tanks, other more compelling names could help pick up the slack. Also, these funds enable you to acquire exposure across multiple industries. This way, you can face market uncertainty with a greater degree of confidence.\n\nIt’s a tricky world out there. Give yourself an advantage with these ETFs to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) The word \"dividends\" written over a blue graph line being drawn by a business person's hand\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jirsak\n\nWhen faced with uncertainty, it’s a good idea to target companies that provide passive income. Generally, these enterprises tend to be the most stable. After all, those dividends must come from somewhere. Nevertheless, it can still be quite a challenge to decipher which names will win out. With the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG), the fund takes much of the guesswork out of the equation.\n\nNotably, technology stalwart Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents the top holding of the VIG ETF. To be fair, it’s not the most generous enterprise, with a forward yield of 0.74%. However, the company has been increasing its payout over the last 22 years. Rounding out the top three are fellow tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nAnother factor that makes the VIG one of the best ETFs to buy is diversification. Technology holds the top weighting at 22.35%. However, the financial and healthcare sectors aren’t too far behind at 20.15% and 16.34%, respectively. Combined with a lowly expense ratio of 0.06%, this Vanguard fund should be on your radar.\n\nUtilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) Miniature house and symbols of public utilities.\n\nSource: Andrii Yalanskyi / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the key reasons why investors ought to consider the utilities sector during market turbulence is the natural monopoly. Technically speaking, nothing prevents a would-be rival from competing against a utility provider. However, high barriers to entry exist, including regulatory frameworks. As such, most don’t even bother, leaving the utility giants entrenched.\n\nStill, it’s difficult to know for sure which utility to buy. So, that’s where the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLU) enters front and center stage. The XLU’s top holding is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), a powerhouse in the green and renewable energy space. Rounding out the top three holdings are Southern Company (NYSE:SO) and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK).\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, there’s not a whole lot of diversification in the XLU – it’s 100% utilities. However, what’s great about the fund is the geographic diversity. For example, Duke covers the Carolinas, which has seen an influx of millennials. Southern covers, as its name implies, the Southern states.\n\nWith the utility firms providing an excellent source for high dividends, XLU is one of the top ETFs to buy.\n\niShares US Consumer Staples ETF (IYK) A store shelf stocked with various consumer staples.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConsumer staples represent everyday products that people need (or want). Thus, the sector provides ample protection from volatility. To be sure, if the market decides to tank, the red ink could end up taking everything down. Still, consumer staple specialists tend to be resilient in large part because of the underlying revenue predictability. Sure enough, the iShares US Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK) makes for an intriguing idea for ETFs to buy.\n\nNot surprisingly, the IYK’s top holding is Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Fundamentally, P&G offers assurances for investors thanks to its relevant products and longstanding brand awareness. Coming in as number two and three are the beverage giants PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Both should benefit from the trade-down effect as cheap providers of caffeinated products.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the IYK is tied to the consumer defensive space specifically (87.94%), the fund includes modest exposure to healthcare (9.61%) and basic materials (1.78%). It’s not an exciting fund per say. However, it should keep your portfolio upright.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
